4	hopefully you still have the remote control .	0
5	if you tossed it out of  the window , you need to fetch it .	0
6	using the remote control , press the i/p button located on the bottom right corner of the remote .	0

10	picture scrolling in b/w :	0

16	i hope i have helped you continue to enjoy the apex dvd player with these troubleshooting tips .	0
17	i have done some research and experimenting with the remote when my apex ad-2500 seemed to have lost its video signal .	0
18	im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button !	0
19	the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place .	0
20	but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it !	0
21	it practically plays almost everything you give it .	0
22	i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor .	0
23	for the price it is a well spent investment !	0
24	i would recommend buying one .	1
25	i've owned 6 or 7 dvd players since 1998 .	0
26	this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways .	0
27	it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set .	0
28	its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .	0
29	it plays alternate video formats ( vcds , svcds , cvds ) very well .	0
30	and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?	0
31	i've bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom .	0
32	strengths are well listed by other reviewers .	0
33	what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e. , mp3s ) .	0
34	that 's a rare and valuable feature .	0
35	i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s , and it 's a lot nicer to access them 4.5 gb at a time ( dvd-r ) than 0.7 gb at a time ( cd-r ) !	0
36	another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying .	0
37	saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable , as i already had a coax cable .	0
38	at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast !	0
39	i wish it would do the same for movies , but that 's one rare / cool feature you will have to forgo .	0
40	weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] .	0
41	if you 're a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rock-bottom price , i highly recommend this model .	1
42	update : the finish is more  mirror  than silver -- and i like it !	0
43	many of our disney movies do n't play on this dvd player .	0
44	i spoke to a rep. at apex and was told that a new format is being used and we wont be able to view any disney movies made in the last couple months .	0
45	player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 .	0
46	for the money , get a better quality player .	1
47	player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play .	0
48	i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse .	0
49	will never purchase apex again .	0
50	customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them .	0
51	pass this player up , and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas !	1
52	for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised .	0
53	then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all .	0
54	new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays .	0
55	i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media .	0
56	there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk !	0
57	this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it .	1
58	i intend to contact the company , but from what i 've read .	0
59	i just got screwed out of fifty bucks .	0
60	apex does n't answer the phone .	0
61	no way to contact their customer service .	0
62	very bad quality .	0
63	i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites .	0
64	i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him .	0
65	now i need to buy myself another one !	0
66	have used it frequently and have had no problems .	0
67	i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company , some models are better than others .	0
68	i liked this one enough to buy another .	0
69	my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money .	0
70	great quality picture and features .	0
71	thought i 'd weigh in here with my stats .	0
72	i 've bought 3 apex dvd players now .	0
73	they play just about everything , but # 2 and # 3 died very shortly after getting them .	0
74	i am back to using # 1 .	0
75	nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .	0
76	this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas .	0
77	the door would not close .	0
78	i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept .	0
79	i am still trying to resolve it four months later .	0
80	it looks great - and is loaded with features .	0
81	unfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type .	0
82	have had problems since the first day	0
83	- not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it .	0
84	save money on the long run - buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month .	1
85	the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me .	0
86	i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it.	0
87	it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation .	0
88	it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time .	0
89	the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air .	0
90	this problem vanished after the first month , so i assume it was a temporary dust issue .	0
91	the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend .	0
92	( he had owned two apex dvd players , and was pleased with both of them . )	0
93	the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting .	0
94	the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons .	0
95	i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed .	0
96	while it is true that it will stand on end , it is also easy to knock over that way .	0
97	i also did n't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode .	0
98	the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings .	0
99	having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying .	0
100	i have not used the progressive scan feature .	0
101	this model has come down in price since i purchased mine .	0
102	while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs , mine has run well , and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase .	1
103	any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor , along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support .	1
104	while i would like to give it 3.5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it .	0
105	i purchased this unit 3 months back and i think the unit knew when my warrenty expires .	0
106	it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do .	0
107	i can only hear the sound .	0
108	i changed video cables , tried connecting to tv on input1 and input2 but no help .	0
109	i think you get what you pay for stands true .	0
110	i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's , after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it 's job .	0
111	i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked .	0
112	as i emailed to the the customer service department , the only thing this player has done consistantly is use enought electricity to keep the red led burning .	0
113	do yourself a favor and save your money to get something of better quality , or at least works .	1
114	if i could give this a negative rating , i would .	0
115	i am surprised amazon still carries this after all of the continued problems .	0
116	wo n't play a lot of discs .	0
117	i can only confirm what other customers have said - crap !	0
118	some movies it played yesterday , it wo n't play today .	0
119	it wo n't play 80 % of my movies , which are all store boughten .	0
120	tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent .	0
121	amazon , do your customers a big favor , do n't carry this item , and give them refunds !	0
122	there should have been a recall on this product .	0
123	fair warning - do not buy .	1
124	i repeat - do n't waste your money .	1
125	i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work !	0
126	it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working .	0
127	one stopped working in february and the other in march .	0
128	amazon has been working with me to refund my money , but they reminded me that i have past the 30 day return policy and this was a courtesy return .	0
129	i have had great experience with amazon , but i will probably not buy electronics any more from them to avoid any future return problems .	0
130	the dvd player does not work properly .	0
131	the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd .	0
132	this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before .	0
133	after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( fkor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them.the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support .	0
134	i have had this dvd player for about 3 months now .	0
135	nothing has broken on it , and it plays all the dvds i have .	0
136	unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd .	0
137	i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode .	0
138	on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd .	0
139	luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can 't .	0
140	unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n't play all my dvds , and now the player can 't play everything .	0
141	i purchased this as a christmas gift for my husband .	0
142	we tried it out christmas night and it worked great .	0
143	even viewed cds full of jpgs .	0
144	we did n't get to use it again for over a month ( sad , i know ) .	0
145	but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture .	0
146	we saw reviews that said the same thing , and also saw here that their customer service stinks .	0
147	though we were past the deadline for returns ( by a few days ) , i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help .	0
148	they authorized my late return , and hopefully they are giving apex heck .	0
149	i hate apex but love amazon , and i tell everyone .	0
150	do not buy this player .	1
151	who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out , but it probably will .	0
152	we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work  apex  dvd players and none worked .	0
153	called customer service and basically was told to either keep buying univ. remotes to try or buy the replacement remote for $ 23 ( which is almost half of what i paid for the whole player ) .	0
154	if anybody knows of a remote to work this-i 'd love to hear from you !	0
155	( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n't play and they were new ones !	0
156	i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective .	0
157	it took over 2 months and repeated follow-up to get it replaced .	0
158	the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line .	0
159	i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again .	0
160	door broke after a month .	0
161	unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs .	0
162	3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything .	0
163	forget about it .	0
164	it 's money down the drain .	0
165	get cheaper panasonics or toshibas or even sonys .	1
166	well , it was nice while it lasted .	0
167	after @ 3 months , it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds .	0
168	as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale .	0
169	only used for 3 month before it 's down !	0
170	i had hoped this was bought from walmart so that i could return it !	0
171	it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .	0
172	the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated .	0
173	maybe it 's good for tvs with not so good color settings , but not good for my tv that already has very vibrant pictures .	0
174	i purchased the ad2600 after feeling comfortable with the reviews i read here on amazon .	0
175	as soon as i lifted the unit out of the box , i questioned my judgement .	0
176	the entire unit was poorly crafted .	0
177	there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board .	0
178	after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it .	0
179	most of the dvds i was trying were fairly new and were in great condition .	0
180	the dvd player just would't recognize them .	0
181	it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc .	0
182	i ended up sending the unit back to amazon .	0
183	this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cdr / cdrw / dvdr / dvdrw , and of course plays dvd movies from uk. i love the aiff , progressive scan feature .	0
184	now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos .	0
185	but for $ 49.99 go get one !	1
186	features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names .	0
187	i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed !	0
188	i have been trying for over a week to contact apex .	0
189	they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy .	0
190	all i am looking for is a rebate form !	0
191	i accually did n't buy the apex ad-2600 from amazon but , the reviews i found here helped me purchase it .	0
192	i have owned an apex ad-3201 for close to 3 years now and i love that deck .	0
193	because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's .	0
194	however , the ad-2600 does n't have this feature ( for now ) .	0
195	the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's .	0
196	it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video .	0
197	i find this to be a great feature .	0
198	i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great .	0
199	for the money apex machines have good features .	0
200	you can 't find the mpeg playback on high priced units .	0
201	it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice .	0
202	i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy .	0
203	i received this dvd player free with the purchase of a palm tungsten e from officemax .	0
204	now i know why - they are pieces of junk .	0
205	less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows  no disc .	0
206	this is the second apex dvd player i 've had - and the last .	0
207	my first player ( model ad-500a ) went into the trash about 6 months after i bought it .	0
208	same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing .	0
209	pay a few more bucks and get something else - it 'll be worth it in the long run .	1
210	i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper .	0
211	the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal .	0
212	loved the slim design .	0
213	this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared .	0
214	apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy .	0
215	it plays all my back-ups , + or - , and everything else i have put in it without a hick up .	0
216	audio is excellent .	0
217	well worth the money .	0
218	after having bought and been disappointed in another brand of dvd player , i purchased the apex ad2600 from amazon and first of all i should say it was delivered much more quickly than i had expected .	0
219	i am very pleased with the apex ad2600.it plays just about anything you put in the drawer .	0
220	so far i 've played regular dvd 's , backup dvd-r 's , mp3 cd 's , and regular cd 's .	0
221	i have not yet tried the photo show capability , but i 'm thinking that will probably work well too , based on the success with the above mentioned disks .	0
222	i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit .	1
223	the comments i 've read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remote.for instance , pushing the button to play pal ( european type ) movies , when an ntsc ( usa type ) movie disk is in the disk tray .	0
224	so , if you read the instructions well , you should n't have any problems with this dvd unit .	1
225	i can 't speak to its long-term reliability , as i 've only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point .	0
226	but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n't anticipate any problems with it .	0
227	bottom line for me is that for the price i do n't think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player .	1
228	simple to use and hook up .	0
229	comes with standard rca jacks for output , along with s-video output ( s-video cable not included , must be purchased seperately ) and also component video outputs .	0
230	the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used .	0
231	i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 1/2 years ago .	0
232	one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent .	0
233	and does n't need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does .	0
234	friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased .	0
235	i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name .	1
236	consider it for a future gift too !	0
237	this dvd play is basicly junk .	0
238	it wo n't play all of my movies .	0
239	keeps coming up with no disk errors .	0
240	i tried called apex cust service , no help .	0
241	do n't waste your money .	1
242	mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs .	0
243	this is the 4 apex player that i have bought .	0
244	you might think you are saving money by buying an apex but in the long run you will spend more .	0
245	each of the 4 lasted less than six months .	0
246	you can get a pretty good progressive scan sony or toshiba now for 68 bucks just about anywhere .	0
247	spend the money its well worth it .	1
248	this is the best dvd player i 've purchased .	0
249	i 've owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all , access speed .	0
250	for those of you who has problems with this player , i 'd suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture , etc.	1
251	this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong .	0
252	80 % of the features on here you will not get by spending $ 100 on a sony or panasonic .	0
253	having said that , this is what you do .  add to cart  !	0
254	i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) .	0
255	they sent me a new ad2600 with the same problem .	0
256	i call apex customer service and they told me that there is a known problem with the model playing disney and other movies and that it is not there problem so i 'm stuck with a new dvd player that wo n't play my kids disney movies .	0
257	i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd-rom player .	0
258	well , this apex dvd player turned out great !	0
259	it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player !	0
260	i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds .	0
261	it 's almost like having a media player / file manager built into the dvd player .	0
262	i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .	0
263	what more can you ask for from a $ 40 dvd player ?	0
264	i guess i 'm just lucky to get a good working unit !	0
265	hope the unit lasts as i 've only had it for 3 days .	0
266	and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey !	0
267	one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does .	0
268	finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me !	0
269	i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad .	0
270	the first one would n't work from the start .	0
271	the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out !	0
272	amazon.com promptly refunded my money for the first one , because a replacement was not available ( thanks amazon.com !	0
273	i am still trying to resolve the problem with the second one .	0
274	i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy .	0
275	i will never buy another apex digital product !	0
276	for the most part this is a good dvd player .	0
277	but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on ithave a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments .	0
278	usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it .	0
279	we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working .	0
280	it is connected to an old television set via composite video and analog audio outputs .	0
281	there was neither picture nor sound .	0
282	connecting the same outputs to a video card in my computer , there was sound but still no picture .	0
283	the trouble shooting section in the user 's manual , suggesting correct and secure connections , does n't help .	0
284	i searched on the internet and found one tip which solved our problem : press i/p button on the remote control .	0
285	it makes the dvd player to switch between interlace mode and progressive scan mode .	0
286	obviously there is no composite video output and different analog audio signals at progressive scan mode .	0
287	we are overall pleased with product .	0
288	i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual .	0
289	i think most of you people complaining about no video is due to you hitting the wrong button either the p/n = pal / ntsc or the i/p is set to progressive scan .	0
290	another stupid move .	0
291	i purchased this as a christmas gift on 12-4 - 03 .	0
292	it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n't the only one this happened to . )	0
293	i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal .	0
294	i also registered the unit online and posted two messages to the apex support person ( there can 't possibly be more than one !	0
295	neither message was answered ( they ask for 24 hours before replying - i 've been waiting 27 days . )	0
296	i finally returned the unit to the company along with copies of my messages and return info .	0
297	let me quote a customer service rep from one of the authorized apex service locations in my state ( they only service apex tv 's , not dvd players ) :	0
298	you can send it in , but i would n't count on ever seeing it or a replacement again .	0
299	it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen .	0
300	i got this dvd player as a gift and had to send it back .	0
301	amazon was supposed to send me another one , but did n't and sent me a gift certificate instead ( i 'm guessing because the price has gone up on this unit since december ).	0
302	progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) .	0
303	seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) .	0
304	also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) .	0
305	output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv .	0
306	i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) .	0
307	it would just spin up and stop , and display  no disc  .	0
308	my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units .	0
309	for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button , a ring around the enter / play button .	0
310	you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll .	1
311	also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv ).	0
312	ok this is our first dvd player so what do i know .	0
313	i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box .	0
314	i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch widescreen dvd 's to normal .	0
315	lot 's of other features that i need to find out about .	0
316	looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .	0
317	things that i 'd prefer different - there 's a red light that shines when it 's turned off !	0
318	and the remote is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck !	0
319	this thing plays everything i feed it .	0
320	i wanted a dvd player that had basic features and would be able to play dvd - r format disc 's that i had made myself .	0
321	when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with .	0
322	easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot .	0
323	i wish i could give negative stars !	0
324	i bought this dvd player in november .	0
325	i have an apex ad600 for a few years now which still works great today .	0
326	i figured with a great first product and with this one having more features than the 600 i would buy one .	0
327	what a mistake !	0
328	after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty .	0
329	i 've tried several dvd 's and even new ones do the same thing .	0
330	i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc .	0
331	i 've tried someone elses and the same thing happens .	0
332	i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable .	0
333	i 've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered .	0
334	i just want to at least try an exchange but you can 't get through to their number , it 's always busy .	0
335	that makes sense though , with all the substandard products they make .	0
336	do not buy this product or any apex product unless you are looking to be frustrated and lose money !	1
337	i bought this as a gift for my sister .	0
338	it has never worked .	0
339	i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still can 't get a video signal from the machine .	0
340	i highly regret trying to save a few $ with this purchase .	0
341	purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it .	0
342	the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button .	0
343	the light goes from red to green but no display or any operation whatsoever .	0
344	i end up unplugging it from the wall for a few hours and when i try again it will work fine.at least until this problem arises again .	0
345	i 've registered this unit at www.apexdigialinc.com and listed the problem .	0
346	they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it 's been 2 weeks without a reply .	0
347	i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response .	0
348	i 've called the service number and if it 's not busy , it rings forever then eventually dumps you .	0
349	once i actually got to an answering machine and left a message .	0
350	still no response .	0
351	i will never purchase anything from this company ever again and have logged my complaint with the bbb .	0
352	i bought this player as a christmas present for my wife .	0
353	3/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze .	0
354	now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk .	0
355	have tried to contact apex via e-mail ( customerservice@apexdigital.com ) , but the e-mail address is not valid .	0
356	have tried calling ( 866-4apexgo ) , but can 't get through .	0
357	this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks .	0
358	i should n't have been cheap , should have bought a toshiba .	0
359	i bought this product from amazon .	0
360	after using it for just a month , i could not play any dvd .	0
361	i can only hear the sound but no picture !	0
362	their customer ( www.apexdigitalinc.com ) service is very poor .	0
363	no contact phone number , only eamil contact which did not respond me .	0
364	i bought this player during a christmas sale at an excellent price .	0
365	however , i should have followed my instincts :	0
366	you get what you pay for .	0
367	one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing .	0
368	some dvd 's i rented would not play .	0
369	now , i suddenly have no picture .	0
370	when the player was working it was great ,but .	0
371	the physical appearance of this apex compared to one previous ( ad1100w ) is most appreciated .	0
372	the prior one looked and felt lightweight , cheesy , and assembled by the oppressed :	0
373	i purchased it for it 's easy ability to accept cd-r hacks .	0
374	i used it lightly , and it lasted just over one year ( forgot to kill the power one day , and now it only plays dvds ).	0
375	it does n't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive .	0
376	without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen .	0
377	excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jvc players .	0
378	remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s .	0
379	anyway , the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago - you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product .	0
380	i 'd have given it 5 stars , but i 'm waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one :	0
381	with progressive scan , i expect it to play play play - and give my old pioneer a rest .	0
382	first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed .	0
383	unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon  , my dvd player came in perfect working condition .	0
384	as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine .	0
385	what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds .	0
386	for example , i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it .	0
387	at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well .	0
388	this player seems to work fine with everything else .	0
389	so i do n't understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them .	0
390	because of this , i am disappointed and would not recommend this product .	1
391	i had apex regular ( non-progressive ) dvd-player for two years .	0
392	had no problem with it .	0
393	now , i thought it 's time to upgrade .	0
394	so , i bought apex ad-2600 in november ' 03 from amazon .	0
395	it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented .	0
396	i have a dvd burner .	0
397	i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price .	0
398	some of my friends had well branded dvd-players but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks !	0
399	most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy .	0
400	if you are skeptical about trying apex .	0
401	take my words and give it a try .	1
402	hopefully you wo n't regret .	0
403	i bought this to replace an expensive ( $ 300 + ) onkyo dvd player that quit after only 3 years !	0
404	this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve .	0
405	i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched !	0
406	so much packed in a small case and very affordable !	0
407	worked for two weeks .	0
408	after two weeks the picture kept freezing .	0
409	spend the extra 20 $ and buy a name brand dvd player .	1
410	only the cheap and poor would buy one .	0
411	unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed .	0
412	i got one of these to serve as a second dvd player in my house .	0
413	it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up .	0
414	basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n't used .	0
415	so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine .	0
416	the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good .	0
417	again , though , it has only been used sparingly .	0
418	the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie  extras  on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that .	0
419	it 's not a big deal for me .	0
420	i simply watched the extra features on another player .	0
421	had this been my only dvd player , though , it would have been a real problem .	0
422	as it is , i 'm keeping the machine .	0
423	it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something .	0
424	but i would expect that , since my movie discs have all played with no problem , the extras discs would , too , without any additional tweaking .	0
425	i 'm giving this player cautious recommendation .	1
426	there are a lot of things i like about it .	0
427	be advised , however , that you may encounter problems .	1
428	received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector .	0
429	the remote is a little hard to understand .	0
430	my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27  screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17  monitor .	0
431	so far the dvd works so i hope it does n't break down like the reviews i 've read .	0
432	prior to christmas , it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad !	0
433	i would n't gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas .	0
434	video output stopped workin .	0
435	this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) .	0
436	i might have gotten a lemon , but this is not the first report of video output failure on this machine .	0
437	i am returning it , and again in the market for a multiformat dvd , svcd , vcd , mp3 , etc. player .	0
438	what a disappointment !	0
439	i bought the apex ad-2600 dvd player for the family for christmas .	0
440	set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week .	0
441	there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue ) .	0
442	but after 10 days , the sound worked , but the video quit working .	0
443	amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping .	0
444	perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy  off  brands .	0
445	i 'm editing my review , because now i wish i read the manual before returning the player i bought for my girlfriend .	0
446	the button on the remote to switch from pal to ntsc was undoubtedly my problem .	0
447	now i may buy two !	0
448	( my orignal review is below : )	0
449	great feature list , poor reliability .	0
450	output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold .	0
451	thankfully amazon has free return shipping !	0
452	retraction : said mine had silver plate : it does have display .	0
453	it works great .	0
454	i should have looked at it harder .	0
455	i purchased two apex 2600 for christmas presents .	0
456	so far we have only hooked up one of them .	0
457	the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg , kodak pic 's and dvd-r ) i have read other reviews and some good and some not so good , but my feeling at this time is  two thumbs up  !	0
458	( i guess only time will tell ? )	0
459	p.s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ?	0
460	what the hell is wrong with this thing .	0
461	i bought this thing because it plays everything .	0
462	this is the third apex dvd i bought .	0
463	the first one was the 705 which i hacked successfully to play all region dvds and disable macrovision .	0
464	the second one was the 2500 which i think is better than the 2600 because it has more features such as karoake which i do use sometimes for parties .	0
465	but heck it plays my alias dvds .	0
466	what the heck is up with the 2600 .	0
467	it suppose to play everything .	0
468	by the way my alias dvds are legit too not no bootleg from the internet .	0
469	i 'm sending this pup back to amazon and looking for the 2500 on ebay .	0
470	forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds.	0
471	i bought the 2600 because it plays everything !	0
472	well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic ) .	0
473	so now it still plays everything , you just can 't see it !	0
474	we ordered two apex ad-2600 's for our family for christmas - finally decided to join the rest of the world and watch dvd 's - well .	0
475	the first one we installed did n't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least .	0
476	the second one is up and running .	0
477	it seems to be working fine , but we 've not used it all that much .	0
478	i am returning the broken one today .	0
479	i will not be ordering another one to replace it .	0
480	update : january 27th 2004 - the second one crapped out only after a week - dont buy this product !	1
481	the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling .	0
482	i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds .	0
483	after  loading  for what seemed like a very long time , the display indicated  no disk  .	0
484	after multilple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available .	0
485	only one disk played through to completion successfully .	0
486	i guess you get what you pay for .	0
487	i 'd recommend against this unit .	1
488	i ordered two of these puppies for christmas gifts .	0
489	when we tried to hook up the first one , it was broken - the motor would not eject discs or close the door .	0
490	when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house , that one didn  t work either !	0
491	imagine my shock - and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex .	0
492	the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on .	0
493	do not recommend .	0
494	what can i say , i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever , quality design , stable , plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies .	0
495	in the last month i bought the apex ad-1600 and the ad-1220 .	0
496	and have returned both .	0
497	the ad-1600 did n't work corectly from the start and the ad-1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up .	0
498	my recommendation is to wait on buying one from this company as they will surely get sent a message of many returned dvd players after christmas 2003 .	1
499	i hoping they will then begin building quality dvd players again , as i do like them .	0
500	it really does n't make any cents $ $ to build a great reputation then destroy it from lack a research and testing in one season .	0
501	amazon is awaesome !	0
502	they refunded my $ $ $ so fast and paid for the shipping back .	0
503	what more could you ask for .	0
504	for the price , it 's a very nice dvd player .	0
505	the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ahwile .	0
506	it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice .	0
507	and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play .	0
508	recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony .	1
509	i finally joined the 21st century and bought this dvd player .	0
510	i knew nothing about dvds before this but with this machine i figured it all out very quickly .	0
511	i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there .	0
512	the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand .	0
513	i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy .	0
514	i applied a $ 25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying $ 29 for this machine .	0
515	even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal .	0
516	bought the apex ad-2600 from amazon in 12/03 mainly on price , $ 49.99 - $ 10 rebate = $ 39.99 .	0
517	we tried the  finding nemo  dvd and when we got to ~ chapter 28 , the frames started to freeze for no reason .	0
518	cleaned the dvd , tried again , no luck .	0
519	i pulled out our old non-progressive scan toshiba , hooked it back-up and the  finding nemo  dvd works fine .	0
520	i agree with previous posts that you get what you pay for .	0
521	i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .	0
522	only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon .	0
523	i purchased the ad 2600 from another company last month and was very satisfied with my purchase , until last night .	0
524	i was watching pirates of the caribbean and decided to watch the extras disc .	0
525	the player kept displaying  no disc  , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ # * !	0
526	i even went as far as calling the technical support number on the disc .	0
527	the person i talked to suggested i take the dvd player back and swap it out with another .	0
528	the other company is currently  out of stock  so i ordered another from amazon and will be taking the original back to the competitor today .	0
529	hopefully the replacement from amazon will work just fine .	0
530	if not i will avoid apex products in the future .	0
531	besides the one problem , this machine is amazing !	0
532	it plays everything , even vcd 's .	0
533	if only it played stand alone avi files .	0
534	if no problems occur with replacement unit i will keep the 4 star rating .	0
535	if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating .	0
536	i will never use all the  whistles and bells  this machine is capable of .	0
537	but for what i do use it is perfect .	0
538	somewhat disappointed that i could not  hook up  to my sony multi brand remote commander .	0
539	well that is not true .	0
540	you could have paid more and got a lot less .	0
541	i paid $ 49 and now it 's $ 125 !	0
542	you have to ask yourself ,  how much money is dissapointment worth ?	0
543	because , you will be dissapointed .	0
544	then you can say ,  my dissapointment only cost $ 39 .	0
545	i think a $ 39 dissapointment is better then a $ 125 dissapointment !	0
546	1 ) frame freezes and the family yells ,  dad ! somethings wrong with the dvd player ! come quick !	0
547	2 ) the remote works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong .	0
548	3 ) you must press the play button and hold it for a couple of seconds otherwise it will not work and you will think the whole unit is broken .	1
549	4 ) it did play my jpeg photos but wow , trying to figure it out was really something !	0
550	5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control .	0
551	i dare you to surf the net and find the code .	0
552	you will be told goldstar codes work , and you will be told zenith codes will work , and radio shack will give you apex codes but they will not work .	0
553	finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 .	0
554	and then you will start to belive them .	0
555	if this is your fist dvd player .	0
556	save yourself some aggrivation .	1
557	bought two ad2600 's for christmas .	0
558	one still works fine , the other quit after one day .	0
559	owner 's manual has substandard troubleshooting guide .	0
560	apex 's website is down and they wo n't answer their phone .	0
561	the dvd player is fine .	0
562	to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press  menu  on the remote while the dvd is playing .	1
563	if the dvd is stopped , it will display  playback only  .	0
564	little inconveinent , but unlike other players i only paid 40 $ .	0
565	i purchased one of these to replace an ailing dvd player that 's a few years old .	0
566	of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents .	0
567	the picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv .	0
568	it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .	0
569	also , if you 're an audiophile , you 'll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short .	1
570	but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there .	0
571	i bought this for my dad for christmas .	0
572	when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture !	0
573	let 's face it - when you want to watch a movie you want to see a picture .	0
574	as i travelled internationally and did n't want to haul it back on a plane with me it was an expensive addition to the recycling bin .	0
575	had to buy my dad a different dvd player locally ( panasonic ) which worked just fine .	0
576	save your cash - go for a brand that actually cares about their reputation .	1
577	bought one for $ 49.99 .	0
578	seemed like a good deal , but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes ,  no disc  .	0
579	sent mine back .	0
580	i 'd look elsewhere .	0
581	granted , i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas , but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player .	0
582	first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds .	0
583	when i hit  menu  it told me ,  playback only .	0
584	i actually had to re-open the drawer and close it to get back to the dvd menu .	0
585	this is extemely lame .	0
586	the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use .	0
587	in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it .	0
588	the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough .	0
589	it also has an optical out , which it should .	0
590	i think for about $ 40 more , you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though .	0
591	i purchased the apex 2600 after reading good reviews of it , both here and in other places .	0
592	after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift .	0
593	it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches .	0
594	both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going .	0
595	one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .	0
596	these problems were consistent , and also not present on another dvd player .	0
597	the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed .	0
598	there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote .	0
599	all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift .	0
600	i was impressed by this very inexpensive player.for the first three hours , and then it died .	0
601	i was told that it is no longer available , so there must be something really wrong with it .	0
602	i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category .	0
603	i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine .	0
604	there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my prev. machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance .	0
605	still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features !	0
606	so i pop-in my first dvd and start to watch .	0
607	i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes !	0
608	ok , that happens , so i try to skip the chapter .	0
609	i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n't do it !	0
610	i try navigating using the player 's built in menu , and it still would n't work !	0
611	my next thought was that the dvd must be damaged .	0
612	upon inspection i did find a small scratch on the surface and figured that to be the cause .	0
613	i decided to check one more thing though and plugged in my 3-year - old unit again just to see .	0
614	the dvd played without flaw through the chapter in question .	0
615	i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either .	0
616	guess where this unit is headed ?	0
617	yup , right back for a refund !	0
618	i was so excited about the price and reviews of this dvd player .	0
619	i am even a bit technology oriented , so i thought it would be a breeze to set this up .	0
620	unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds. even though they were not damaged in any way .	0
621	i called apex 's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing .	0
622	i hope that amazon will let me trade it for a different , more trusted brand of dvd player .	0
623	this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it .	0
624	ability to play most discs - i tried dvd , vcd , dvd-r , audio cd and it played all	0
625	the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel	0
626	remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons .	0
627	if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed , i would rate this a 5 star machine .	0
628	this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player .	0
629	i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it !	0
630	apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .	0
631	also , very light and portable .	0
632	the one i purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any dvd disc .	0
633	it will read and play all cd audio disc .	0
634	guess i will return it for an exchange and hope for the best with the new one .	0
635	so far not going to get a good review .	0
636	i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far .	0
637	i received the apex ad-2600 before i expected .	0
638	that is where my satisfaction ends .	0
639	i bought the apex ad-2600 because of the ability to play jpegs and it seemed like it was the most bang for the buck .	0
640	however , it has failed to deliver on quality .	0
641	it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies .	0
642	on several different occasions it has displayed  no disc  with a disc inside .	0
643	after reading several other reviews this appears to be relatively common .	0
644	i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product .	0
645	i am returning mine for a replacement , but if i receive another ad-2600 with the same or similar problems i will not only return it for a refund , but never buy another apex product in the future .	0
646	i guess you get what you pay for .	0
647	the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display .	0
648	picture on web site clearly has the play display pictured , yet false silver plate .	0
649	clearly a large lawsuit if i were so inclined .	0
650	i feel that once i contact amazon that they will get to the bottom of this .	0
651	i just got it today and have tried to verify the claims of other reviewers .	0
652	no go on most formats .	0
653	it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs .	0
654	however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips .	0
655	i guess that i can not complain since it does not actually claim to play vcd / svcd formats , but others say they can .	0
656	also , it was only $ 39.99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player .	0
657	bought this player after reading the reviews here which identify it as reading most formats including dvd + rw 's and vcd 's .	0
658	can 't say whether i rec 'd an  updated  model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me .	0
659	it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine .	0
660	i do n't have a dvd + r to try	0
661	mixed bag i guess but the price was right .	0
662	this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price .	0
663	it goes nicely with my apex 27  in my bedroom .	0
664	the build quality feels solid , it does n't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dts and dd5.1 sound good ) .	0
665	i paid twenty dollars more than the current price , and even then it was a steal .	0
666	think you need to pay a fortune for a good qulaity dvd player ?	0
667	it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims .	0
668	i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did .	0
669	i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n't had any problems .	0
670	there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc .	0
671	so sit back , relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can 't do half the things this one can , and for a fraction of the price !	0
672	only problem , if you think it 's going to be delivered in the 24hrs amazon claims , do n't hold your breath .	1
673	otherwise it 'll get there the day you get back from the hospital !	0
674	noiseless , lightweight and oh yeah .	0
675	silverish color really adds a special touch .	0
676	who cares if it does n't have multiple slots ?	0
677	it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . )	0
678	if you watch dvds once in a while like i do , get this !	1
679	apex is made in usa and is one of the underrated brands out there .	0
680	if you watch one dvd per weekm its yours .	0
681	however , i do n't know the dvd 's performance on a heavy load of every-day viewing .	0
682	either way , can 't go wrong with this price .	0
683	i am really impressed by this dvd player .	0
684	if it can fit in the drive bay , this dvd player will play it .	0
685	for instance , i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ) and it plays the dvds .	0
686	i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .	0
687	the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .	0
688	after i took their picture with their camera , they offered to take a picture of us .	0
689	i just told them , press halfway , wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way .	0
690	they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) .	0
691	a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .	0
692	i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) .	0
693	ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras .	1
694	bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .	0
695	i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .	1
696	this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is !	0
697	i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it .	0
698	just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .	0
699	whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together .	0
700	as its 4mp , you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) .	1
701	i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast .	0
702	a good choice could be cf type ii , microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images .	1
703	some things that i did n't like ( but hey . nothing is perfect ).	0
704	* main dial is not backlit .	0
705	* lens visible in optical viewfinder .	0
706	( well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans ) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too .	0
707	overall i 'm happy with my toy .	0
708	i did extensive research comparing different 4 and 5 megapixel cameras .	0
709	a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models .	0
710	following my research , i decided on the g3 .	0
711	in a word ,  awesome  is how i would describe this camera .	0
712	i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers .	0
713	with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet .	0
714	and with the panoramic  stitch  mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image .	0
715	i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 .	0
716	do n't walk , run and buy this camera if you have the budget , i guarantee you will not be disappointed .	1
717	i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .	0
718	i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality .	0
719	the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .	0
720	the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .	0
721	still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera .	0
722	despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography .	1
723	i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .	0
724	the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .	0
725	i 've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) .	0
726	i 'm one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i 've been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top , but that does n't stop me from loving this camera .	0
727	the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )	0
728	i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review .	0
729	1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings .	0
730	excellent range of metering options as well .	0
731	it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .	0
732	2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )	0
733	3 ) 4x zoom is nice	0
734	4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed .	0
735	5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .	0
736	you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .	1
737	1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )	0
738	2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )	0
739	4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying .	0
740	the camera has a wonderful set of features .	0
741	the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .	0
742	you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd .	1
743	the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .	0
744	the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .	0
745	i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .	0
746	the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .	0
747	the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .	0
748	the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .	0
749	it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .	0
750	recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .	0
751	advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .	0
752	newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .	0
753	4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .	0
754	do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype .	1
755	unless you want to print murals , you do n't need it .	1
756	those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .	0
757	anyone looking for more than  point and shoot  can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference .	1
758	the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .	0
759	i expect the g3 will please me for years to come .	0
760	i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !	1
761	it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .	0
762	i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .	0
763	i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out .	0
764	the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .	0
765	i would recommend a larger compact-flash card , at least 128 mb .	1
766	i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon .	0
767	what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you ?	0
768	i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally .	0
769	at the same time , i wanted my wife to not be intimidated by knobs and buttons .	0
770	i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .	0
771	i showed her how to turn it on , where the lens zoom lever is , and she loves it !	0
772	this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .	0
773	the prints are beautiful !	0
774	and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality .	0
775	i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected .	0
776	although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .	1
777	this is a great camera for you !	0
778	the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an  auto  mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .	0
779	i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos !	0
780	i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus .	0
781	i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .	0
782	but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !	0
783	once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located .	0
784	with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .	0
785	the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .	0
786	it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !	0
787	this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .	0
788	you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .	0
789	the more i work with it , the more i love it !	0
790	i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow !	1
791	i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase !	0
792	this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .	0
793	i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge .	0
794	seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .	0
795	but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in  auto  mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !	0
796	four megapixels is great .	0
797	i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me .	0
798	if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download .	1
799	if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for .	1
800	if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it .	1
801	it is a very amazing product .	0
802	i highly recommend it .	1
803	just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .	0
804	takes excellent photos .	0
805	night mode is clear as day .	0
806	i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .	0
807	the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .	0
808	however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem .	0
809	overall it is the best camera on the market .	0
810	i give it 10 stars !	0
811	this camera has significantly more noise at iso 100 than the nikon 4500 .	0
812	i just bought the camera a few days ago .	0
813	before i  get used to it  , here are my first feelings :	0
814	a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )	0
815	b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage .	0
816	i wish canon would work out some way for that issue .	0
817	the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .	0
818	i bought this last week through amazon .	0
819	got a great deal from a reputable seller .	0
820	i love this camera .	0
821	i am still trying to figure out the may options it has .	0
822	took hundreds of pictures and they were great .	0
823	great colors , pictures and white balance .	0
824	has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .	0
825	it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for .	0
826	maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .	0
827	it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .	0
828	sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task .	0
829	i do n't think i was asking too much .	0
830	any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort .	0
831	and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera .	1
832	i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .	0
833	i wanted it to shoot concerts as well .	0
834	that meant even less light and just as much action .	0
835	sure , i adjusted the film speed to 400 .	0
836	the grain was terrible .	0
837	next time i set it at 100 and used the flash .	0
838	well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .	0
839	when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .	0
840	the camera was a marvel .	0
841	getting the printer to help output them was another tale .	0
842	overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do .	1
843	for simple point and shoot photography , consider a cheaper digital .	1
844	you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost .	1
845	then again a one time use camera may do just as well .	0
846	if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality , this will be your camera .	1
847	it is versatile and seems to be one of the best .	0
848	me , i am going with a leica minilux ( the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen ) .	0
849	it is less versatile , but i am never disappointed with the output .	0
850	i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias .	0
851	i have been watching the development of digicams for years , waiting to make my first move .	0
852	what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses .	0
853	i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient .	0
854	hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations .	0
855	i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .	0
856	the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .	0
857	as of this writing , technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr .	0
858	at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available .	0
859	what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .	0
860	once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus .	0
861	now what about the flash problem ?	0
862	relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .	0
863	fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .	0
864	i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 .	0
865	for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c .	1
866	in order for this to work , you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself .	1
867	contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .	0
868	you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .	1
869	then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored .	1
870	the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself .	0
871	this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away .	0
872	unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved .	0
873	the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) .	0
874	but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .	1
875	the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you .	0
876	the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine .	0
877	now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !	0
878	the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .	0
879	i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information .	0
880	maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .	1
881	i didnt wait to experiment .	0
882	instead , i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug-in .	0
883	what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .	0
884	without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !	0
885	the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .	0
886	what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .	0
887	what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it .	1
888	but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera .	0
889	i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .	0
890	i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .	0
891	this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .	1
892	my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .	0
893	battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .	0
894	manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .	0
895	i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .	0
896	not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .	0
897	if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there .	0
898	or save time and just do it , you wo n't regret it .	1
899	after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews .	0
900	the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try .	0
901	i 'm very glad i did .	0
902	the service from the supplier was exceptional .	0
903	the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition .	0
904	having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .	0
905	recently , i attended a  flyball  competition	0
906	-- an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles .	0
907	by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced .	0
908	the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .	0
909	in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom .	0
910	about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .	0
911	this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler .	0
912	i always shoot using the lcd panel .	0
913	i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !	0
914	being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 .	0
915	but canon never fails to amaze .	0
916	some of the great gains over g2 --	0
917	1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .	0
918	2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .	0
919	3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .	0
920	looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive .	1
921	4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .	0
922	a big plus in my book .	0
923	5 . the 1/200 sec , f5.6 + nd filter for highly exposed ( or very brightly lit ) environments .	0
924	the light auto-correction is awesome .	0
925	you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right .	0
926	6 . the g2 's  color effect  exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable  effect func  menu option available in all exposure modes .	0
927	there are six default settings ( off , vivid , sepia , neutral , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening , contrast and saturation .	0
928	7 . a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view .	0
929	i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera .	0
930	( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ).	0
931	8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .	0
932	in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking .	0
933	9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep .	0
934	personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors .	0
935	overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .	0
936	there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize .	0
937	short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) .	0
938	this is quite simply the best you can ask for .	0
939	i love my g2 so thought i would upgrade .	0
940	the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .	0
941	got way too many blurry pictures .	0
942	i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 !	0
943	when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .	0
944	yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power .	0
945	not only was i was shopping for a camera that would suit my casual and artistic photographic needs , i had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well .	0
946	her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use .	0
947	the nikon 's are great cameras .	0
948	+ they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .	0
949	- the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format .	0
950	olympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body .	0
951	+ takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use .	0
952	- i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very usefull .	0
953	photos had some artifacts and noise .	0
954	my fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands .	0
955	we also looked at the fuji fps602 .	0
956	nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .	0
957	fiance did n't like the feel .	0
958	4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )	0
959	a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more .	0
960	the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own .	0
961	i have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will .	0
962	always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do !	1
963	the powershot g3 is a great camera .	0
964	because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !	0
965	4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .	1
966	it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .	0
967	make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time !	1
968	the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .	0
969	prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture .	0
970	no one told me , but i wanted to tell you .	0
971	this is not the same thing as a film camera .	0
972	and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs .	0
973	they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet .	0
974	most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera .	0
975	but once in a while , i run up against it 's major flaw :	0
976	it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .	0
977	i am not talking milliseconds .	0
978	your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board , so you compose the shot and wait for your moment .	0
979	when it arrives , you press the shutter release .	1
980	the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .	0
981	perhaps there is a way around this delay .	0
982	some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get .	0
983	yes , i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay .	0
984	yes , i have red-eye off , and yes , i 've tried adding a flash .	0
985	but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera .	0
986	i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera .	0
987	it focuses in a snap .	0
988	dim or bright , it would never take a picture after the birthday candles had blown out , after the tae kwon do kick broke the board .	0
989	canon 's g3 does it consistently .	0
990	it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .	0
991	i challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive .	0
992	and so i must ask , what are cameras for ?	0
993	what task do they perform ?	0
994	cameras capture moments .	0
995	because once the moment is gone , it is not coming back .	0
996	the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras .	0
997	a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .	0
998	not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem .	0
999	like i said , when the moment is gone , it is gone .	0
1000	so buy the g3 .	1
1001	buy it for fun , for lack of processing , because you want to use iphoto , or whatever .	1
1002	but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose .	1
1003	from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to .	0
1004	unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted .	0
1005	this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .	0
1006	i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it .	0
1007	i love the quality of the pictures .	0
1008	they look fantastic .	0
1009	i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .	0
1010	it 's just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments .	0
1011	the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .	0
1012	i 've tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens , but the pictures were too digital .	0
1013	with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .	0
1014	i love the eos based controls and easy menus .	0
1015	i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera .	0
1016	many before me have done that already .	0
1017	i agree with the positive reviews .	0
1018	but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .	0
1019	1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .	0
1020	though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display  lens  when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself .	0
1021	i 'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap , i may damage the lens .	0
1022	very cheaply made .	0
1023	2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .	0
1024	the g2 was better in this respect .	0
1025	it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .	0
1026	despite these grieps , i still recommend the camera .	1
1027	i used a canon powershot s20 for about 2.5 years and loved it !	0
1028	there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted .	0
1029	i finally decided to upgrade , and started my research .	0
1030	canon was an obvious choice , but i did not want to limit my decision , so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives .	0
1031	i researched , held , tested , and observed 3 different brands .	0
1032	needless to say , the canon won , hands down .	0
1033	this camera performs like i can not believe !	0
1034	i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !	0
1035	it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode .	0
1036	this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !	1
1037	another point of note : the battery life is incredible !	0
1038	i did not have a backup battery , and had no need for one .	0
1039	i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying .	0
1040	this camera will stay with me for years !	0
1041	i 've been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v = finally decided that now was the time .	0
1042	after a lot of research , i decided on the g3 .	0
1043	am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !	0
1044	i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .	0
1045	forget the fact that it 'll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer .	0
1046	i 've been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual .	0
1047	very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera .	0
1048	i charged it up the day i got it , took a bunch of pictures and i do n't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged .	0
1049	the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .	0
1050	i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures .	0
1051	the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .	0
1052	one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .	0
1053	as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .	1
1054	these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .	0
1055	the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .	0
1056	for more info on digital cameras , go to dpreviews .	1
1057	you can read the other reviews for specs and performance opinions .	0
1058	i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ?	0
1059	because this camera is beautiful .	0
1060	the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely .	0
1061	the g3 looks like a work of art !	0
1062	its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .	0
1063	the little digital elphs were the best-designed , most-elegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them .	0
1064	this is my first digital camera .	0
1065	i am very pleased with it so far .	0
1066	i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time .	0
1067	this seemed like a really good compromise .	0
1068	i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 .	0
1069	based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal .	0
1070	it is not perfect though .	0
1071	here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far :	0
1072	it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera .	0
1073	you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .	0
1074	( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .	0
1075	that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw .	0
1076	to save a picture as raw , you have to have the display on , this seems like a waste of battery power .	0
1077	it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?	0
1078	( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . )	0
1079	for those of you using a mac in os x+ there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop .	0
1080	it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .	0
1081	i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok .	0
1082	i am quite happy with the camera .	0
1083	it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .	0
1084	yes , i recommend it over the competition .	1
1085	best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .	0
1086	this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .	1
1087	i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this .	0
1088	for those of you who already bought this camera , i suggest you buy a hi-ti dye-sub photo printer .	1
1089	i do n't write many reviews but i 'm compelled to do so with this camera .	0
1090	first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .	0
1091	save them on computer and print out just the ones who want .	1
1092	duplicates are a no brainer and cheap .	0
1093	no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic 's for just a couple of keepers .	0
1094	crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time .	0
1095	the technology is finally here folks , to make your photo life easier .	0
1096	a great new use for that underutilized computer .	0
1097	a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use .	0
1098	poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .	0
1099	this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .	0
1100	my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home , but now she 's forever asking for the digital camera .	0
1101	and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) .	0
1102	get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash .	1
1103	in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots .	0
1104	i have n't used any of them since i got the g3 .	0
1105	unless your a professional , now you will need only one camera . this one .	1
1106	i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera .	0
1107	you can always spend more money to get a better one .	0
1108	however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .	1
1109	it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !	0
1110	also , the display is  hinged  and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .	0
1111	one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .	0
1112	however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .	0
1113	another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .	0
1114	i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything .	0
1115	it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera ..	0
1116	bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations .	0
1117	in general it is easy to use and well laid out .	0
1118	for `` cool factor '' buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does n't have any wow factor .	0
1119	it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .	0
1120	the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .	0
1121	in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode .	0
1122	my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again .	0
1123	the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses !	0
1124	this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 's large mobile screen helps with this .	0
1125	the included memory card is too small .	0
1126	go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense .	1
1127	it is made of plastic .	0
1128	for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience .	0
1129	this is by no means unique to this model , i 'm sure .	0
1130	the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .	1
1131	this is not a handbag camera .	0
1132	while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .	0
1133	the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .	0
1134	flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .	0
1135	the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography .	0
1136	the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .	0
1137	if you can afford this camera , you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble .	1
1138	the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .	0
1139	canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .	0
1140	learning how to use it will not take very long .	0
1141	the image quality is excellent .	0
1142	messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results .	0
1143	unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough .	1
1144	range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .	0
1145	please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used .	0
1146	a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film .	0
1147	i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there 's nothing like picking one up and playing with it first .	0
1148	this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .	0
1149	it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box .	0
1150	the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .	0
1151	this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .	0
1152	beats that sony f717 ; its archrival .	0
1153	i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;	0
1154	i can 't fit all that resolution ( 4mp = 2272x 1704 resol . ) in my 19in flat monitor ( 1200x1024 resol . ) anyways .	0
1155	please go to read dpreview.com and you 'll get the complete story .	1
1156	my story is based on personal usage .	0
1157	yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture .	0
1158	moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon .	0
1159	the distortion is not a flaw .	0
1160	as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .	0
1161	i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .	0
1162	in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !	0
1163	the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to .	0
1164	in terms of the important accessories , i got myself an the extra litium battery .	0
1165	based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots .	0
1166	i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash .	0
1167	the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it .	0
1168	anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 .	0
1169	it 's a winner .	0
1170	i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .	0
1171	my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com .	1
1172	they got the best lens adapter for the g3-better than canon 's .	0
1173	that 's what i did and hopes this helps .	0
1174	the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .	0
1175	it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .	0
1176	to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .	0
1177	( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on .	0
1178	you see , i can 't rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with ( j and r camera . ) to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product .	0
1179	although you may think you 're dealing with amazon , you 're dealing with some second rate store that you 've never heard of .	0
1180	after charging my card for the camera and for expedited shipping , 5 business days later , they still had n't shipped the product .	0
1181	i called them twice and both times they said it is  about to ship  .	0
1182	one of the calls was on a saturday and when i pressed the guy a bit , he said ,  actually we do n't ship on saturdays  .	0
1183	so i finally gave them a deadline which they said they could meet .	0
1184	although they accepted that they will ship on mon - 6 jan , they still did n't ship it .	0
1185	they said it is in stock , but they are  too busy  .	0
1186	they were n't busy enough to charge the credit card , though !	0
1187	although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint .	0
1188	i cancelled the order .	0
1189	hope to get my refund in a timely manner .	0
1190	thanks for nothing , amazon !	0
1191	this camera has a major design flaw .	0
1192	when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .	0
1193	i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .	0
1194	after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera .	0
1195	everything else about the camera is great .	0
1196	if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera .	1
1197	however for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much .	0
1198	i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected .	0
1199	i 've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year , and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom , more adjustability , a hot shoe for an external flash , and a remote control .	0
1200	i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price .	0
1201	i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far .	0
1202	and so far , i 've been very pleased .	0
1203	there 's a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel image versus the 2 megapixels of the s330 , especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures .	0
1204	the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .	0
1205	the moveable lcd screen is great .	0
1206	you can take pictures with the camera held above your head , way down , or beside you with no problem , allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself .	0
1207	the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .	0
1208	i also purchased a good sturdy tripod : the combination of the new camera , tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor , natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before .	0
1209	the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :	0
1210	i chose the canon speedlite 420 .	0
1211	this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .	0
1212	i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :	0
1213	i shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter 's birthday party without switching out to my backup battery .	0
1214	the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .	0
1215	i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .	0
1216	you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do .	1
1217	i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .	0
1218	( i 'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level . )	0
1219	the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .	0
1220	and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .	0
1221	i bought a 512 mb card , which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution .	0
1222	i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .	0
1223	i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :	0
1224	i can imagine that they 'd fill up my ibook 's internal memory pretty quickly .	0
1225	at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe 's photoshop elments 2.0 software , and can 't praise it highly enough .	0
1226	if you 're investing in a camera at this level , buy this software !	1
1227	and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers .	0
1228	the bottom line : if you 're serious about your digital photography , or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot , this may be just the camera for you .	1
1229	but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time : you 'll see the difference in your photos immediately .	1
1230	i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .	0
1231	i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting .	0
1232	it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures , especially in mixed-light settings .	0
1233	if you do n't have a gray card , you can use a plain white piece of paper .	0
1234	i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker .	0
1235	especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations .	0
1236	i did buy the telephoto lens ( and the required extension ) .	0
1237	very easy to use .	0
1238	i 'll probably also get the wide-angle now , too .	0
1239	very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .	0
1240	i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .	0
1241	after doing a hands-on comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dsc-f 717 ( both of which lack the quality , feel , or features of the g3 ) , i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality ( resolution and coloration are superior ) .	0
1242	it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life , enthusiast features , external flash capabilities , available storage types , image formats , and more .	0
1243	this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features .	1
1244	it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to  get into  it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .	1
1245	all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .	0
1246	the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture quality and battery life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera .	0
1247	canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .	0
1248	simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .	0
1249	the canon allows you to change lenses , and it accepts the ibm microdrive ( type ii compact flash ) , so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage .	0
1250	for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card .	0
1251	the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .	0
1252	the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .	0
1253	even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .	0
1254	definetely a great camera .	0
1255	proven canon built quality and lens .	0
1256	feels solid in hand .	0
1257	rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .	0
1258	this is an edited review , now that i have had time to use the device .	0
1259	while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability .	0
1260	it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there .	0
1261	like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .	0
1262	the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better .	0
1263	further , the xtra doubles the maximum filecount capacity to 16000 mp3 .	0
1264	this is especially useful for those who listen mostly to pop music and store all those short ditties .	0
1265	when compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short , but only by a bit .	0
1266	yes the ipod is smaller , but not $ 200 worth , which is the premium you 'll pay for an equivalent capacity model .	0
1267	yes , the ipod looks in tune with the carefully articulated urban-hipster persona thats become popular as of late , but sure-as-hell is n't worth the $ 200 premium ( unless you are just dying to match your music player with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfitters wardrobe ) .	1
1268	for me , i 'll save that cash for another purchase .	0
1269	before i decided to get this player , i did my research .	0
1270	i looked up the ipod , the dell jukebox , and the samsung napster player .	0
1271	i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .	0
1272	another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it .	0
1273	that takes up half the space of mp3 's .	0
1274	that 's important because i have a lot of music .	0
1275	the software is great .	0
1276	you can sort your music by artist , title , album , or genre , and you can play music based on those categories .	0
1277	transfering is easy , the software makes everythig pretty easy .	0
1278	even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .	0
1279	only 1 problem , no accessories ... yet .	0
1280	i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard .	0
1281	they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .	0
1282	can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon .	1
1283	get it , it 's woth every penny ! !	1
1284	i was a little concerned to be the black sheep buying this player instead of the incredibly overpriced apple i-pod .	0
1285	i 've had it for a week now , do n't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it .	0
1286	if you have any doubts about this player , well do n't .	0
1287	software is easy to use ( although redhat software is better , but costs money )	0
1288	much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate	0
1289	no issues as of yet	0
1290	you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck	1
1291	hopefully , this player will out sell the ridculously over-hyped i-pod .	0
1292	if you want to be a poser and follow the herd , mooooooh , then buy the i-pod .	1
1293	otherwise , be smart , save the cash .	0
1294	for me the sound of the music is what is important .	0
1295	the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s .	0
1296	navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well .	0
1297	at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod .	0
1298	the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) .	0
1299	i suppose that you could jog with it but it seems to be made for the enjoyment of music .	0
1300	so far the software for the pc works easily .	0
1301	by the way , it looks nice also .	0
1302	this thing kicks mighty apple butt !	0
1303	i would have given this thing 4.5 stars but since i can 't , i 'll be sweet and give it the full 5 stars .	0
1304	it 's worth it .	0
1305	i personally do n't like apple or their business practices ( screwing resellers , customers and employees left and right ) so i shopped around for something else .	0
1306	after finally stumbling upon this zen nx player , i knew i had found what i was looking for .	0
1307	my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .	0
1308	this thing lasted well over 14 hours when i played it straight for the first time .	0
1309	the zen nx is $ 100 cheaper than the ipod of the same size , so you have to wonder just how much apple 's markup is anyway !	0
1310	the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .	1
1311	you wo n't appreciate the quality this thing has to offer unless you are using a good set of cans.	0
1312	the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !	0
1313	the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad .	0
1314	it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .	0
1315	the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue .	0
1316	it does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves .	0
1317	( i would have appreciated having a firewire plug , however )	0
1318	the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .	0
1319	other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .	0
1320	( did i mention you can actually change the battery ? hello ? apple ? are you listening ? )	0
1321	i probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver / metallic ... like the battery adapters on their usb thumbdrive ( muvo nx ) mp3 player models .	0
1322	since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment , aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make .	0
1323	overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !	0
1324	( batteries last longer too ! )	0
1325	i shopped around for a month looking for a good mp3 player , and all i heard was how good the i-pod was .	0
1326	after messing with it at a store i noticed how bad the i-pod was .	0
1327	it was marked up increadably high compared to other models ( almost $ 500 for a 30gb ) , and theres was nothing about it that made it worth that much money .	0
1328	the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .	0
1329	i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever .	0
1330	the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .	0
1331	the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .	0
1332	all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .	0
1333	just get some new headphones and your set .	1
1334	within 5 minutes i was able to transfer files .	0
1335	it 's a very intuitive program .	0
1336	i had no problems following their installation instructions .	0
1337	the menus are very easy to navigate .	0
1338	the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .	0
1339	the other controls are all very easy to use .	0
1340	it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .	0
1341	the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer .	0
1342	unlike the ipod , this is fully windows compatible and can be used right out of the box .	0
1343	for ipod you have to buy a cable and it is n't compatible with all windows pcs.	0
1344	it also costs a lot less than the ipod .	0
1345	the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad .	0
1346	they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality .	0
1347	this is a good deal for music and data storage .	0
1348	one thing i should note is that i have only had this product for one day , so there are many options i have not explored .	0
1349	the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .	0
1350	on my relatively new computer ( p4 with windows xp and usb 2.0 ) , the os complained about the installation of the drivers .	0
1351	despite the instructions insisting that the process was fairly automatic , i had to install the usb drivers and the nomad interface software manually .	0
1352	the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use .	0
1353	with the nomad explorer software , songs should be drag-and-drop .	0
1354	i have not yet tried the cd-ripping program .	0
1355	the player itself has all sorts of problems .	0
1356	the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .	0
1357	the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .	0
1358	the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .	0
1359	depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .	0
1360	the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating .	0
1361	on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured .	0
1362	i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .	0
1363	overall , a very disappointing product .	0
1364	the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par .	0
1365	the player 's mechanics are also flawed .	0
1366	although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .	0
1367	i was trying to decide whether or not i should go with the 40 gb ipod or this 30 gb zen xtra .	0
1368	when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat .	0
1369	if you want the other accessories the ipod offer , maybe that 's where you should go .. .	1
1370	this is a great investment for someone like me who enjoys music and hates carrying multiple cds .	0
1371	i just transfered over some 40 cds and have plenty of space left for me .	0
1372	one beef is the scroll , it does n't work as well as i 'd like .	0
1373	other than that this thing is great ...	0
1374	zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod .	0
1375	all rechargeable batteries lose their holding power over time ( around 2 years ) .	0
1376	apple 's solution - pay apple another $ 400 + for a new ipod ( less a paltry discount ) .	0
1377	the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance .	0
1378	deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ).	0
1379	notmad by red chair software is an explorer-based program that enables simple drag-and-drop transfer of music files from pc to zennx .	0
1380	the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky .	0
1381	zennx 's capacity / price ratio on the 30g model ( $ 10/gig ) ) trumps ipod 's 30g model ( $ 14/gig ).	0
1382	choosing zennx is a no-brainer when factoring in the cost of a new $ 400 + ipod every few years versus the $ 50 cost of replacing zennx 's rechargeable battery .	0
1383	zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery .	0
1384	update : apple recently announced that for $ 107 , it will replace the battery in ipods shipped to their factory .	0
1385	lithium ion rechargeable batteries are good for 300-500 rechargings , so battery lifespan will vary according to your usage .	0
1386	still , apple continues to squeeze dollars from consumers by not designing the battery to be replaceable .	0
1387	i love my new nomad , its great !	0
1388	now i dont have to lug around 80 cds if i dont know what i 'm going to want to listen to biking home .	0
1389	this thing , while looking pretty cool , is not as sexy as the ipod .	0
1390	for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison .	0
1391	the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .	0
1392	the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .	0
1393	on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof !	0
1394	if you want a sexy , cool , accessory-availible mp3 player , by all means , get an ipod for a hundred dollars more ( or one for the same price that holds 1/3 of the music ) .	1
1395	but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .	1
1396	best electronic i 've bought since i was born .	0
1397	i just sold my archos 20gb jukebox recorder after not being satisfied with it 's slow loading & difficult navigation , not to mention it froze quite a bit .	0
1398	i was in search of a new item to take it 's place as my new mp3 player / harddrive .	0
1399	for an early christmas gift , i got a zen xtra 40 gb player .	0
1400	i refused to go for an ipod , i am not going to spend all that money just for the apple name and because it is  trendy  to have that player .	0
1401	this was the closest alternative and best buy for this type .	0
1402	after receiving my zen xtra 40gb mp3 player .. .	0
1403	i will just say this :	0
1404	i will never go back to my archos again ! !	0
1405	so easy to set up , had some problems with my archos .	0
1406	stayed up all night trying to figure out that thing .	0
1407	just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc.	0
1408	not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy .	0
1409	very sleek & stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has .	0
1410	the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .	0
1411	all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .	0
1412	the sound quality is also nice ... after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with .	0
1413	lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .	0
1414	navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .	0
1415	also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player .	0
1416	it was impossible to do so before .	0
1417	oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^	0
1418	another plus in my book , no file limits !	0
1419	i was limited to 999 files in a playlist with archos ' os , now i can have as many as i want .	0
1420	i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up .	0
1421	i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .	0
1422	now i can transport files to friends house with ease .	0
1423	when plugged in , it does n't lag the computer like the archos did ... unless you are doing a massive transfer of data in one load .	0
1424	after playing with this little device , i do n't know why i would look at an ipod with the same space when it costs $ 500 and i got mine for a little more than half that price !	0
1425	i really have no complaints over this unit .	0
1426	i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .	1
1427	in fact , my boyfriend is now going to invest into one of these suckers as well ... now he realizes that this is the best choice over his current archos and the ipod he was eyeing .	0
1428	getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .	0
1429	the cd just has too many problems with win xp .	0
1430	i am going to have to try an online download and see if that works .	0
1431	also , the instruction manual is very bad .	0
1432	i have no complaints with this mp3 player .	0
1433	getting files onto it is quick and painless .	0
1434	then sorting the files is easy as pie .	0
1435	and it holds sooooo much music and audio files .	0
1436	my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .	0
1437	also , the sound is wonderful ... my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with .	0
1438	come on, at $ 300 they could at least put in a good pair of earphones .	0
1439	sheesh ! !	0
1440	the battery is nice .	0
1441	i listened to it for several days before needing to recharge them .	0
1442	the lcd screen was very large and readable .	0
1443	thank you !	0
1444	my last mp3 player 's screen drove me nuts .	0
1445	a great buy .	0
1446	compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck .	0
1447	i think the whole zen line has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced , but it 's not really appropriate to compare the pricing of the zen line to the ipods ( although , the ipod is still way over priced ) .	0
1448	you 're talking totally different hardware .	0
1449	all of the zens use a standard notebook drive .	0
1450	this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes ... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive ).	0
1451	the ipod uses a smaller ( and more expensive ) drive ( 1.8  ) .	0
1452	the devices competing with the ipod are the iriver ihp 120 , the rio karma , and the philips hdd100 .	0
1453	i should point out that the new rio karma is now down to about $ 280 and is reviewed readily as being as good as ( and better in some areas ) the ipod .	0
1454	the 20 gig ipod still goes for just under $ 400 .	0
1455	that 's a huge difference ... especially in this price range .	0
1456	i can 't believe people continue to pay those prices .	0
1457	advertising pays off i guess .. .	0
1458	i doubt anyone has ever seen an add or commercial for any other mp3 player .	0
1459	i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .	0
1460	my personal favorite is the karma ( i currently own a karma , a zen usb 2.0 , a philips hdd100 , and an upgraded 60 gig archos jukebox recorder ).	0
1461	i guess that 's why you so often see  ipodders  bashing every other player out there ( very often not knowing anything about them the whole  i spent $ 120 more for something not any better and so should you ... so i can feel better  thing .	0
1462	i originally purchase a 30 gb nomad zen xtra as a portable mp3 player .	0
1463	after fiddling around with it for a while , i notice a few dissapointments :	0
1464	transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 .	0
1465	it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .	0
1466	having 4000 or so mp3s , i never got more than 500 transfered .	0
1467	scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .	0
1468	size - bigger than the ipod	0
1469	software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut .	0
1470	after i went through the transer issue , i returned the zen xtra and purchased the 40 gig ipod .	0
1471	song transfers were not an issue .	0
1472	i transfered all 16 gigs in 15 minutes without any errors via firewire .	0
1473	the navigion on it can be a little quirky , but still operates better than the zen 's did .	0
1474	the ipod is also an attractable piece , being lightweight and small .	0
1475	the casing scratches a little easy , but the glove cases work great to protect against this .	0
1476	sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features .	0
1477	i chose to keep the ipod and am very happy with the purchase .	0
1478	granted it is a little more than the zen , it is well worth it .	0
1479	itunes is a versatile program and i have n't had any issues with the ipod itself .	0
1480	i love this player .	0
1481	its great .	0
1482	all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n't done it since .	0
1483	i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again .	0
1484	the software was great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) .	0
1485	i got every song i had downloaded to the player within a day or so .	0
1486	it only took about 30 minutes to download everything , and that was about 950 songs .	0
1487	anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it .	0
1488	first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most asthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture .	0
1489	the pro ...	0
1490	way less expensive than the ipod .	0
1491	my opinions :	0
1492	personally , i do n't understand all the complaints about the interface .. .	0
1493	i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. .	0
1494	it actually gives the option to clear the previous playlist when i want to play another list .	0
1495	meaning i do n't have to manually clear the list , and then load the new list .	0
1496	the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another .	0
1497	and man ... i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player ... because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title ..	0
1498	and since the current language selection was english (even though i think only the menu supports chinese , and not the track info ) ... all it saw were  ?  s and even though the songs had different names in chinese ..	0
1499	if it had the same number of  ?  s then it would ask if you want to overwrite another song that just had the same number of  ?  s. . .	0
1500	buyer beware ! sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly ( maybe this applies to other players too , and not just the nomad , i do n't know ) .	1
1501	i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand .	0
1502	not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .	0
1503	once you start sending files , it 'll continue until it 's done or it hits a song that has the same title as another song ... at which point you can skip , skip all , replace , replace all , or cancel .	0
1504	and go from there ... if you chose one of the  all  options , then you do n't need to do anything until it 's done .	1
1505	in two transfer batches ( first was english songs , then foreign languages ) , it did n't come up with any errors ( aside the duplicate name i mentioned ).	0
1506	so i do n't know what the previous review that could n't do more than 30 songs is talking about .	0
1507	of course , unlike that person i will mention that i upgraded the firmware to 1.23 . 00. but i did transfer files before the upgrade without problem too .	0
1508	you should update the firmware before upgrading the drivers if you decide you need the newer drivers for the pc.	1
1509	the mediasource itself was flaky ... crashing my explorer twice within the first hour ( the crash did n't require a reboot ) ... but after another reboot , it has n't crashed since .	0
1510	did i mention i 've already dropped it once ?	0
1511	that was n't pretty .	0
1512	there 's a dent on the upper-back-right and lower-back-right corners ... not too obvious unless you 're up close .	0
1513	hehe , my bad .	0
1514	that 's all for now .	0
1515	bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent .	0
1516	i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it .	0
1517	i 'll have to borrow cd 's to rip from friends to even come close to filling the thing .	0
1518	i 'm not sure why people have problems with either the interface of the nomad , or the software that comes with the unit .	0
1519	both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice .	0
1520	besides user error ( surprise , surprise ) , it 's hard to imagine people having trouble with either .	0
1521	ripping & transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1.1 usb ) .	0
1522	people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .	0
1523	it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .	0
1524	the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .	0
1525	you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .	0
1526	i just put it on  shuffle  , sit back , and enjoy the eclectic mix that almost 3,000 tunes offer !	0
1527	the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .	0
1528	my  fast forward  button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go .	0
1529	not an urgent issue , as it still works .. .	0
1530	all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .	0
1531	i 'll have to see if this becomes a problem down the road .	0
1532	but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary .. .	0
1533	we 'll see if i need them to .	0
1534	sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much .	0
1535	this is not the unit you should use if you go jogging anyway .	1
1536	it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy .	0
1537	i use mine at the office , in the car ( with a cassette adapter ) , and will be taking it on a flight back east for the holiday .	0
1538	get better headphones .	1
1539	rip your tunes at 192kb if you like , alhthough 128kb sounds just dandy , and you 'll get more tunes stored on it .	1
1540	bottom line ... great product , unbeatable price .	0
1541	i got mine for $ 160 less than the ipod 30gb ( got an extra $ 30 off for applying for an amazon visa ... thanks amazon ! )	0
1542	basic shipping was a bit slow , but that 's okay .	0
1543	i got it now , and i 'm diggin ' it .	0
1544	awful , awful , awful .	0
1545	unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks .	0
1546	if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders .	0
1547	it 's a shame , but mine is going back .	0
1548	bummer as it has great sound quality .	0
1549	i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it .	0
1550	my brother bought an ipod this past summer and my dad bought the original zen around the same time ..	0
1551	just before we all spent a couple weeks in an rv together .	0
1552	the ipod is a neat piece of machinery but after screwing around with both of them i think the zen products are the way to go .	0
1553	so i requested and received a zen xtra as a christmas gift .	0
1554	the setup and transfer process was cake for me .	0
1555	i just used the explorer program to move my songs to my player .	0
1556	i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem .	0
1557	the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .	0
1558	it 's been so long since i 've had a program not shut down on me in windows that i hardly even noticed that it happened .	0
1559	that 's probably a bad thing .	0
1560	the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .	0
1561	it was always after it finished a process or something , so it did n't cause any file errors .	0
1562	now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems .	0
1563	the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it .	0
1564	i have n't tried setting up any playlists yet so i can 't comment on any problems there .	0
1565	the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .	0
1566	the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it .	0
1567	the dial on the original zen was perfect and i wish it was on this model .	0
1568	all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player .	0
1569	i 'll admit that i 'd own an ipod if i had money to burn , but for the money this is a much better buy .	0
1570	highly recommended !	0
1571	i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic !	0
1572	i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver .	0
1573	this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and downloaded then installed the updated driver .	0
1574	i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy .	0
1575	if you have always on internet or are logged into the internet you can use the feature that will download the album & song id information ( this is a free service ) with the click of a button .	1
1576	ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier .	0
1577	i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .	0
1578	just highlight the songs you want to transfer from your playlist or music library then click one button and it 's done !	1
1579	being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .	0
1580	i use my own mid-priced headphones rather than the enclosed earbuds .	0
1581	when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good !	0
1582	the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .	0
1583	actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated .	0
1584	finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy .	0
1585	i like to play my music by album and the nomad jukebox plays the songs in the same order as the actual cd .	0
1586	the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight .	0
1587	i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price .	1
1588	just bought one & i 've enjoyed it to date .	0
1589	nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .	0
1590	all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .	0
1591	the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative .	0
1592	i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment .	0
1593	- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .	0
1594	the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use .	0
1595	the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical	0
1596	- included creative software is pretty poor .	0
1597	red chair 's notmad explorer is great & recommended by about every reviewer to repleace the creative jukebox software .	0
1598	note : this will add about $ 30 to the price to purchase , but worth it	0
1599	- great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price	0
1600	after receiving the box from amazon , i proceeded with charging the unit for the specified 4 hours , after which i installed the software and connected the unit to my pc via usb 2.0 .	0
1601	the pc quickly picked up on it and attempted to install the software , which failed , as creative chose not to follow microsoft standards , whatever .	0
1602	i then installed the software manually instead , after having to click past about 5 windows of  please register with us so we can spam your inbox  .	0
1603	at this time , i decided to turn the player on , and much to my surprise it comes with quite the little library of classical music , one of which is a childhood favorite , bach 's air .	0
1604	i tried to play the song three times , with no success .	0
1605	it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk .	0
1606	well , maybe that particular song was just corrupt , so i tried to upload some of my own , after four attempts , at each one the unit locked up and required a reboot , i managed to upload an album , which albeit was surprisingly fast , however when attempting to create a playlist out of my newly uploaded songs , the nomad again froze up and refused to work .	0
1607	i made an additional five attempts at creating a playlist , before packing the unit up and heading over to amazon 's product return page .	0
1608	needless to say , i would n't recommend anyone purchasing this product .	1
1609	had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .	0
1610	charged my battery .	0
1611	plugged it in .	0
1612	installed software .	0
1613	started ripping and transferring .	0
1614	if you arent hooked up to cddb to get the album info i guess you have to manually input the stuff , but that little work will save you looking for songs .	1
1615	i 've got 1200 songs on it now and about 4000 more to go .	0
1616	working for 10 hours with it on  shuffle  totally rocks ! !	0
1617	i love it ! !	0
1618	i bought this only to have it break within a month .	0
1619	this product is too fragile for normal use .	0
1620	i received this as a gift .	0
1621	i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .	0
1622	however , the creative software is not real intuitive .	0
1623	the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .	0
1624	if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .	0
1625	you are better off deleting it , re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player .	1
1626	transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 .	0
1627	it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds .	0
1628	i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .	0
1629	i love the storage in this thing .	0
1630	i have 100 of my cd 's transferred and have n't made a dent in the 30 gb drive .	0
1631	i doubt i will use half of the storage capacity , but you never know .	0
1632	this is definitely opening up possibilities to obtaining mp3 's in which i would have never purchased the cd .	0
1633	now my dissapointments .	0
1634	the description of the warranty is buried on the supplied set up cd .	0
1635	the warranty is 90 days .	0
1636	this is ridiculous .	0
1637	to me this alludes to the manufacturer 's confidence that the product will last for a year .	0
1638	buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) .	1
1639	the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks .	0
1640	seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection .	0
1641	the interface used could be better designed .	0
1642	it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want .	0
1643	i am a software engineer and if i wrote an interface to my software that worked like this , there would be hell to pay , not to mention the ridicule from my peers .	0
1644	and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control .	0
1645	it is some protection for the unit , but for useability , forget it .	0
1646	the screen is covered , so to make any new selections you have to open it .	0
1647	the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel .	0
1648	there are no other aftermarket cases available for this model yet , so you have to live with it .	0
1649	despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc. .	0
1650	however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .	0
1651	i have had it lock up after a transfer of music .	0
1652	the files are there , but i could not access the player without removing the battery , waiting a short period and re-inserting the battery .	0
1653	also have had it lock up when i shut it down to attend to a phone call .	0
1654	left it set on my desk came back five minutes later and it just wanted to keep playing the same song over and over .	0
1655	could not stop it , could not get out of the  now playing  screen .	0
1656	again had to remove the battery .	0
1657	there have been other occurrences of locking , but i will not bore you with the details .	0
1658	quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .	0
1659	there have also been times that the unit has been turned off for some period of time , upon powering it up it starts on the  now playing  screen with a song or cd that i had been playing days before .	0
1660	i have n't quite figured this one out yet , but it is probably operator error .	0
1661	now i have not owned other mp3 players as i was waiting until they matured , but since i received it as a gift i now have this one .	0
1662	i would suspect that there are similar problems with all of the other brands as this is somewhat new technology .	0
1663	and we all know about the rush to market on new products .	0
1664	i have had this player for 2 weeks , i will be returning it for an exchange in the hopes that the locking problem and scroll wheel are problems with this particular unit .	0
1665	while i am at the store i will definitely get the extended warranty as i have another day or so ( from the purchase date ) to obtain one .	0
1666	i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year  no questions asked  replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous !	0
1667	this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .	0
1668	first let me give you the bad things :	0
1669	1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more .	0
1670	2 . the scroll button is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .	0
1671	3 . that 's pretty much all the negatives the positive things truly outnumber the negatives , and the negatives are n't that bad .	0
1672	first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .	0
1673	the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .	0
1674	compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use .	0
1675	to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod .	0
1676	if you purchase this product , definitely rip your songs through windows media player .	1
1677	otherwise , you 'll have to mess around a lot with filenames inside the ( decent ) nomad explorer , which is not fun at all .	0
1678	this thing seriously is a good player though .	0
1679	overall i like the unit .	0
1680	i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .	0
1681	if it were not for that i would have given it 4 .	0
1682	1 ) price / gb of storage	0
1683	2 ) storage capacity	0
1684	3 ) user replaceable battery	0
1685	1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days )	0
1686	2 ) scroll button / switch	0
1687	3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing .	0
1688	features that would have been nice :	0
1689	1 ) fm receiver - some models out there have this .	0
1690	2 ) fm transmitter - so you can place the unit in your car and listen to the unit through your car stereo .	0
1691	they sell an adapter unit to use with your car 's cassette deck .	0
1692	but who wants the wires involved .	0
1693	a short range fm transmitter would be much nicer .	0
1694	i believe the napster mp3 player has this feature .	0
1695	do n't drop this unit :	1
1696	i 've had the player for about a month now .	0
1697	overall i like it .	0
1698	as mentioned above i broke the player within the 1st 10 days .	0
1699	i was sitting on a train and it fell off my lap and broke .	0
1700	i think it fell right on the earphone plug when it fell ( murphy strikes again ) .	0
1701	i was able to return it to the retailer where i bought it and got a replacement .	0
1702	if you are going to need a player that is rugged this may not be the one for you .	1
1703	i purchased the extended warranty ( something i almost never do ) when i returned the unit to get the replacement .	0
1704	updating the unit 's firmware :	0
1705	when i first purchased the unit i downloaded the firmware update that was available on their website .	0
1706	the upgrade went smoothly and was easy to do if you can follow directions .	0
1707	i would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation .	1
1708	the storage capacity is great .	0
1709	i do n't think i will ever use the full 30gb .	0
1710	i currently have ~ 1100 songs encoded mostly at 196 kpbs and i have n't even used 10gb of storage yet .	0
1711	i 'm starting to listen to cd 's that i have n't listened to in years now that i have them all handy in one place .	0
1712	for those out there that are not familiar with mp3 encoding , you can encode your cd 's at varying quality levels .	1
1713	typically people use 96kbs to 320 kps.	0
1714	the higher the number the better the quality ( less data compression is used ) and the larger the file size .	0
1715	if you decide to encode at 320 you will fit less on this device than someone who encodes at 128kps .	0
1716	you should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player .	1
1717	if you 're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end ( typically 128 is considered close to cd quality ).	1
1718	the price compared to the ipod is great .	0
1719	price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .	0
1720	one word of caution with regards to using the nomad with itunes .	0
1721	i discovered this weekend that itunes does not sell mp3 's in the mp3 format .	0
1722	it using something called ac3 ( at least the trial song i purchased was in this format ) which is not a compatible format for the nomad .	0
1723	i have n't figured out if this is the case for all the songs on itunes .	0
1724	but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes .	0
1725	scroll bar :	0
1726	the scroll bar is a bit of a pain .	0
1727	sometimes you skip past things or have to press it twice to select items .	0
1728	it 's not the end of the world , but a better design sure would be nice .	0
1729	i 've had no problems with the software .	0
1730	i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) .	0
1731	the software will convert your cd 's to mp3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to .	0
1732	my 2.6 mhz pentium 4 with usb 2.0 was able to perform the task pretty quickly ( i would estimate ~ 5 - 8 minutes per cd ).	0
1733	through the software you can classify songs in genres .	0
1734	this is a nice feature ( i.e. it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to  easy listening  rather than  heavy metal  - no problem .	0
1735	the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .	0
1736	you can also create your own if you do n't like their classifications .	0
1737	you can edit the genres once the songs are on the play if you decide to re-classify things later .	0
1738	this can be done on a song by song basis or in mass .	0
1739	in addition , you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation cd right on your player .	0
1740	this is pretty cool .	0
1741	the sound from the player is ok .	0
1742	i was a little disappointed in the low end .	0
1743	i did buy separate headphones as other have recommended .	0
1744	i was able to improve things a bit by using the units equalizer and boosting the base .	0
1745	the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .	0
1746	it 's probably good for the health of your ears , however i consistently play it near the high end of the volume range ( and my hearing is fine ).	0
1747	wow , dennis sure is great !	0
1748	slowly yet surely my unit engorged as i read my own review , similar to when i look in the mirror .	0
1749	this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records .	0
1750	sometimes when i get really lonely , i like to put on some kenny g and light some candles , and while this does n't help , i am a capitalist pig and like buying things too , nah mean ! ?	0
1751	i did have some problems figuring out how to turn the unit on , but creative did a good job with this , as they had a clearly labled  on  button that i found when i left my cellar for the first time in years .	0
1752	there was very little light in there .	0
1753	anyway , im gon na go find dennis now , have a nice day ! ! !	0
1754	i got my zen xtra a little bit more then a week ago .	0
1755	it was not my first choice .	0
1756	i have done a lot of research before i decided to buy the nomad zen xtra .	0
1757	one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) .	0
1758	for the price and features it is really good .	0
1759	one thing , before buying this player i have called the creative tech. support and asked them if i can navigate by folders beside artist / album and answer was yes .	0
1760	sure enough there is no such ability .	0
1761	not sure , if customer rep. did not know the product exactly , it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear .	0
1762	in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders .	0
1763	you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division .	0
1764	creative is talking about updating it via firmware , however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players , looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates , not too much of new features .	0
1765	the software , which comes with player is not good at all .	0
1766	i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work .	0
1767	after installing it and trying to make it working for 30 minutes i went and bought notmad .	0
1768	notmad worked right away after install and it is what i would like to see from the product .	0
1769	transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other .	0
1770	often i fill i need to have better organization for the library and there is not enought of variables .	0
1771	artist , album and genre are only mp3 tags which are supported buy this player , and if you have 100 artists would be good to have another subcategory .	1
1772	after all those players have 40-60 gb of hard drive , so better organization is required .	0
1773	the bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver .	0
1774	i downloaded the trial version , and after less than 10 minutes of using it , decided it was well worth the price .	0
1775	so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .	0
1776	for once , though , this 3rd party software is excellent .	0
1777	dont let the bad reviews of the software change your mind .	1
1778	zens rule .	0
1779	originally i wanted the ipod .	0
1780	most people probably wanted the ipod before realizing that a vast array of full-featured viable alternatives exist .	0
1781	i like the way apple is innovative , but let 's face it - they can 't be the only one with an idea to enclose a 2.5  hd within an aluminum case in a stylish package for long , especially after the buzz is out of their little techie pod .	0
1782	the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car .	0
1783	so what ?	0
1784	i can do that myself .	0
1785	longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities .	0
1786	the visceral teases include the case , the sound quality , and the capacity .	0
1787	i have n't checked the resilience of my xtra yet , and do n't plan to .	0
1788	however , if anyone has participated in violent or extreme sports while using their zen , please share your experiences .	0
1789	i 'm considering using mine as a distraction to winter boredom in the paintball fields .	0
1790	it can get pretty lonely out there .	0
1791	i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it .	0
1792	the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .	0
1793	the only thing the ipod has over the nomad is the style , size , and ease of use .	0
1794	the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .	0
1795	so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .	1
1796	i only have one question , when i add tracks to my nomad , via nomad explorer , they are automatically put in alphebetical order , rather than album order .	0
1797	is this possible to fix , if so how , if not does notmad explorer from red chair software do this ?	0
1798	i would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering .	0
1799	thank you very much , and go out and get yourself a nomad !	1
1800	wow .. .	0
1801	this thing is trash .	0
1802	want the laundry list of reasons why ?	0
1803	of course you do !	0
1804	a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop	0
1805	b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display	0
1806	c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said	0
1807	d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on	0
1808	e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage	0
1809	f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course	0
1810	so .. .	0
1811	im taking mine back tomorrow morning , and getting a nice shiny new ipod instead .	0
1812	do n't waste your time , engery , resources on this thing , just spend a little more for a far more functional ipod .	1
1813	i bought the zen xtra 30g as a gift .	0
1814	what a disappointment .	0
1815	the software failed repeatedly .	0
1816	i could n't load more than one song before the software crashed .	0
1817	creative labs customer support website is useless .	0
1818	software downloads on the site crashed my pc .	0
1819	creative tech support operators work 9-6 p.m. weekdays - as if i had time during work hours to spend time on this .	0
1820	do n't buy this thing .	1
1821	i just bought this player today and i already love it .	0
1822	it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .	0
1823	another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on .	0
1824	otherwise , this player is awesome !	0
1825	it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .	0
1826	the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .	0
1827	overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it .	1
1828	i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards .	0
1829	naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www.nomadness.net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable .	0
1830	compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops .	0
1831	- price : see above .	0
1832	- sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .	0
1833	- the unit is easy to use and intuitive .	0
1834	it took me about 5 minutes before i had mastered the controls .	0
1835	- uploading music is quick and easy .	0
1836	although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent .	0
1837	i have uploaded about 3,000 songs now with very minimal difficulty . ( it 's fast too ! )	0
1838	btw , be sure to have your mp3 tags labled correctly , as this will ensure a great organization .	1
1839	- the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n't .	0
1840	as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .	0
1841	structurally , everything is secure and it wo n't fall apart on you .	0
1842	the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool .	0
1843	there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .	0
1844	- the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily .	0
1845	ipod users have to send theirs back and pay $ 100 for a replacement .	0
1846	also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy .	0
1847	- equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .	0
1848	the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .	0
1849	the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead .	1
1850	this player is an ideal purchase .	0
1851	there is n't need to get in details again , but just remember it rocks because : price , sound , ease of use , and features .	0
1852	i would recommend this player to anyone i know , and you will not be dissapointed .	1
1853	the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt .	0
1854	i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player .	0
1855	on my main computer the software did not work right .	0
1856	i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all .	0
1857	i eventually gave up with customer support and worked on fixing the problem myself .	0
1858	i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic .	0
1859	it seems that depending on the system the software might not work or might work , because it works on all the other computers i have .	0
1860	so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost .	0
1861	i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .	0
1862	first there 's the unit itself .	0
1863	it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx .	0
1864	the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so .	0
1865	the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did .	0
1866	the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate .	0
1867	the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .	0
1868	the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle .	0
1869	the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . )	0
1870	the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .	0
1871	the software has n't been a hassle for me at all .	0
1872	i ignored the instruction booklet ( as i do with any product ) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes .	0
1873	my sister was able to figure it out on her own as well , and she is of average computer competence .	0
1874	the less computer-saavy might find apple 's software a bit friendlier , though ( i use it at a friend 's house and it does do a lot more for you . )	0
1875	lastly , the price is fantastic :	0
1876	i spent $ 269 for my 30gb zx , compared to the $ 299 for a 10gb ipod and the also expensive iriver ihp-120 .	0
1877	for prospective buyers , i would warn of the following : 1 ) purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible , as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable ( this applies to earbuds in general , ) and 2 ) make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them , that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves .	1
1878	if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you .	1
1879	read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! !	1
1880	( i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down - maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead ) .	0
1881	and have you seen the price of the ipod extras that you need .	0
1882	eg 60 $ for a plastic box to hold 4 aaa batteries to increase the use time past 6-8 hrs ( reviewers figures )	0
1883	i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .	0
1884	transferred the zens new software onto it in about 10 seconds .	0
1885	it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds .	0
1886	usb 2.0 - very fast	0
1887	yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them .	1
1888	but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .	0
1889	and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ).	0
1890	it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .	0
1891	the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it .	0
1892	i am very pleased so far .	0
1893	i had all my files already on my pc in wma format ( 200 cd 's ).	0
1894	so far so good , no problems , no conversions .	0
1895	very simple to use .	0
1896	the reason it does not get 5 stars	0
1897	1 ) a spare battery would have been great .	0
1898	2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it .	0
1899	3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players	0
1900	all in all suprisingly easy to use .	0
1901	lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .	0
1902	excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .	0
1903	there was no distortion and it sounded great , especially with eax environmental audio enabled .	0
1904	transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .	1
1905	i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software .	0
1906	however , it does n't register instantly as a hard drive like other players .	0
1907	you have to install the software to the computer you 're transferring to , instead of just connecting it with a usb connection .	1
1908	this would have been much easier .	0
1909	the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk .	0
1910	i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .	0
1911	this almost made it worth the price alone .	0
1912	i was able to easily copy 2gb worth of video files from my computer , and then transfer them to a friend 's .	0
1913	huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .	0
1914	30gb is more than enough for most people .	0
1915	having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers .	0
1916	it only took me about 10 seconds to transfer a 200mb file .	0
1917	it took maybe 15 minutes to transfer 1000 songs .	0
1918	navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .	0
1919	this is great as long as all of your music have id3 tags , and if you 've downloaded your songs off the internet , many probably do n't .	0
1920	it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system .	0
1921	you can 't simply open up a folder from the player and play all the songs in it .	0
1922	whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox , it dumps all of them into a single folder , and then sorts them by the id3 tags.	0
1923	fm receiver - it has none .	0
1924	i would be nice to have a simple fm receiver so i could pick up local stations .	0
1925	that way i could get rid of a walkman alltogether .	0
1926	cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .	0
1927	the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .	0
1928	i 'm not sure if it would survive a fall from 3 feet .	0
1929	as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .	0
1930	the top of the player is a thin metal piece that covers up the battery and is removable .	0
1931	i could crush this thing in half with two fingers if i wanted to .	0
1932	this is not a player you can take jogging .	0
1933	the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd .	0
1934	you have to add them to the playing list .	0
1935	i can 't simply bring up my entire list of songs , click play , and then hit next .	0
1936	you have to add all the songs to a play list .	0
1937	there is probably an easier way to do this , i just have n't found it yet .	0
1938	software - the software is crap .	0
1939	i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .	0
1940	otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward .	0
1941	like most people , i do n't want to read the instructions , i just want to use it .	0
1942	even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .	0
1943	i would recommend replacing the existing software with the  notmad explorer ,  which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet .	1
1944	no line out jack - as i said , there is none .	0
1945	the headphone jack acts as a pseudo line out jack .	0
1946	so you can plug your nomad directly into your stereo or use a car adapter , but you do n't get the quality from a true line out jack .	0
1947	it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack .	0
1948	controls are a bit awkward .	0
1949	the controls definately took some getting used to .	0
1950	it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .	0
1951	when i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was .	0
1952	a sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included .	0
1953	i want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it .	0
1954	crappy headphones .	0
1955	the included earbuds were uncomfortable .	0
1956	i would replace them with some better sounding and more comfortable phones .	0
1957	difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say  difficult ,  but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate .	0
1958	it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly .	0
1959	i think this is it 's biggest flaw .	0
1960	i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes .	0
1961	up , down , left , and right would have given me better control .	0
1962	if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get  stuck  rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it .	0
1963	case - the nomad comes with a leather holding case .	0
1964	it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack .	0
1965	that way i could keep it in the case all the time .	0
1966	as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .	0
1967	you can cut up the case a bit with an xacto knife and make it useable though .	1
1968	overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it .	0
1969	i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .	0
1970	after looking over multiple large mp3 players , i decided to get this one .	0
1971	for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price .	0
1972	a 10 gb ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins , accesses files or does antyhing .	0
1973	i think the reson for the creative being larger is for sound dampening and protection , whihc is a plus , but then again it is only speculation .	0
1974	the buttons and interface are very easy to use .	0
1975	simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use .	0
1976	but the major problem i had was with the software .	0
1977	you are not able to simply import files , but rather you have to go through multiple steps to find them .	0
1978	the instructions that come with it do n't explain how to make things simple .	0
1979	the quick sync is n't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is n't very useful .	0
1980	i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .	0
1981	i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player .	0
1982	well that was not a simple task .	0
1983	i ended up suing windows player to make mp3 's ( actually wma files ) and then using the probram to transfer .	0
1984	i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .	0
1985	buy this for the storage and price , avoid it if you know nothing about computers .	1
1986	with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod .	0
1987	an ipod with the same amount of memory is $ 150 cheaper .	0
1988	the reason for this the ipod has  a better user interface  .	0
1989	i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .	0
1990	also the ipod has games on it .	0
1991	games are ok for a cell phone , but mp3 's are for music .	0
1992	i purchased this player last week .	0
1993	i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on .	0
1994	i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway .	0
1995	i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product .	0
1996	the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .	0
1997	the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity .	0
1998	the battery life seems good , takes very lttle time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs .	0
1999	took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo .	0
2000	i have n't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box .	0
2001	all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product .	0
2002	if you have the money and need 40 gb , this is the player for you .	1
2003	it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .	0
2004	i would recommend this product to anyone .	1
2005	before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there .	0
2006	many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me .	0
2007	the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive .	0
2008	the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .	0
2009	the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual .	0
2010	the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .	0
2011	the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .	1
2012	playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists .	0
2013	the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .	0
2014	i purchased and returned this product , but not because of any glaring flaws in the design .	0
2015	it is an extremely cool gizmo .	0
2016	in fact , everyone who saw it thought i was  the man  and wo n't believe i returned it .	0
2017	so what 's the problem ?	0
2018	i made the mistake of thinking i could easily manage my mp3 library with this device .	0
2019	i initially loaded about 3700 tracks with the intent of ripping the majority of my remaining cds to mp3 .	0
2020	i quickly discovered that the nomad was n't going to work for me .	0
2021	the reasons below will be true for any product in this category .	0
2022	here 's why :	0
2023	1 . i do n't need the nomad at the office .	0
2024	i have my mp3 's stored on my workstation .	0
2025	2 . i do n't need the nomad at home for the same reason ( although using it to sync between the two pc 's might be a reason enough to get it . )	0
2026	3 . it 's a hazard in the car .	0
2027	the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving .	0
2028	( throw a cell phone and you 're asking for trouble . ) 3a .	0
2029	creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .	0
2030	the bottom line :	0
2031	if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions , i 'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk .	0
2032	sure it 's  old school  to carry a cd wallet around , but it will be easier to manage and i 'll save around 250 bucks .	0
2033	one major complaint :	0
2034	my only significant complaint is sound quality .	0
2035	the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .	0
2036	this did not give me enough control .	0
2037	i wanted to use the nomad with a cassette style car adapter .	0
2038	i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with  bass boost .	0
2039	the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad .	0
2040	one minor complaint :	0
2041	the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity .	0
2042	gee ... thanks a lot creative .	0
2043	well in the beginning i was asking around for mp3 players .	0
2044	so then i came across the ipod ( 10 gb ) .	0
2045	so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one .	0
2046	well i decided to get this one .	0
2047	well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .	0
2048	well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .	1
2049	well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze .	0
2050	i was going to get a 10gb ipod , but after looking at the 10 day warranty for ipod and www.ipodsdirtysecret.com ( battery lasts 18 months ;	0
2051	it costs like 200 dollars to replace - now you mail it off to get the battery replaced for like 99 .. .	0
2052	what a big improvement ... lol ) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers , i realized this is a much better buy .	0
2053	not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have .	0
2054	anyway , on with the review .	0
2055	so far i 've only had it since christmas , so i cant tell you much about the battery life .	0
2056	it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ).	0
2057	software : for the people who complain about software , please , stop complaining .	0
2058	once you hook the thing up to the computer ( via the usb cable ) , the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it 's there & installs the drivers .	0
2059	from there , you transfer files from your computer to the mp3 player ( with the help of the media sniffer .. . read the manual ).	1
2060	my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them .	0
2061	if you 're copying cds with windows media , its really simple to give your songs id3 tags , so thats what i do .	0
2062	oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy .	0
2063	the player : it 's silver .	0
2064	a little weighty ( 9 ounces ... no biggie ) , but otherwise fine .	0
2065	people complain about the scroll wheel , but its not a big deal at all ( though it is just a little annoying at times ) .	0
2066	it 's easy .	0
2067	the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .	0
2068	the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .	0
2069	my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature .	0
2070	you can customize bass , etc. like usual , but also you can customize the sound of the player ( like how it would sound in a concert hall , jazz club , etc ).	0
2071	its really cool .	0
2072	sound quality is amazing. i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .	0
2073	you can also slow a song down & speed it up , which is cool too .	0
2074	but the earbuds suck !	0
2075	buy new ones asap. every time you move your face or something they pop out .	1
2076	for a 250 dollar player , they could have thrown in nice headphones .	0
2077	a remote would have been cool too ... but lets not push it .	0
2078	oh ... one more thing .	0
2079	i forgot , the case does n't fit .	0
2080	my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .	0
2081	so far the player froze on me once ( i started pushing buttons before it loaded ) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that .	0
2082	so all you do is stick a pin or something small in the reset button & you 're golden .	1
2083	also , you can store data on it , which is a plus. for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n't bother , this is a much better buy .	1
2084	hope i helped !	0
2085	i 'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder .. .	0
2086	what made this product so great to me was the open source os called rockbox .. .	0
2087	based on hardware one could assume the archos players were horrible ( which by hardware standards .. . they were ) .. .	0
2088	but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .. .	0
2089	now we come to the zen xtra .. .	0
2090	first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. .	0
2091	the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .	0
2092	what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software .	0
2093	not just the transfer software ( which was a hellishly horrible experience ) but also the player 's software .	0
2094	first of all , many actions that the player utilizes do n't make sense . .	0
2095	bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. .	0
2096	rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .	0
2097	this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. .	0
2098	the dynamic playlists (  now playing  , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. .	0
2099	well , anyway i could go on and on on why this player did n't meet my expectations .. .	0
2100	i 'll just say this .. .	0
2101	for the average music listener not expecting much ... this may be a satisfactory mp3 player ...	0
2102	but for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback .. . i can 't recommend this product .	1
2103	i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer ; while my office bars the addition of any non-work software , it does n't care if you load cds onto the hard drive .	0
2104	over time , i loaded hundreds of cds onto the computer , and the idea of carrying around all of my music with me became attractive .	0
2105	many people recommended the ipod , and i borrowed one from a friend .	0
2106	while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .	0
2107	also , there is the need to send the ipod to replace the batteries when they die ( which they will ).	1
2108	i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .	0
2109	it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod , and has a longer battery life .	0
2110	the storage capacity is great for me --	0
2111	i have a large but not huge cd collection and have loaded everything i want to listen to on it and still have 13 gigabytes free .	0
2112	the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price .	0
2113	loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well .	0
2114	i had never loaded my cds on to my home computer , using my work computer instead .	0
2115	my office would not let me put the software on to my work computer .	0
2116	this meant that i had to take all my cds and do in a fairly short period of time what i had done over a year at work .	0
2117	if the music had been on my home computer , the transfer would have been accomplished very quickly .	0
2118	i have an older computer , running windows 98 se , and so those of you with something more recent would find the process even quicker .	0
2119	my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .	0
2120	when you load a disc , you go to an internet cite for the insertion of the names for the cd and the tracks .	0
2121	while the listing process is accurate for track names ( unlike windows ' reliance on the amg , which frequently gets track listings out of order ) , the results can be odd .	0
2122	the cd will be classified into a number of genres , and in multidisk sets , you can get separate classifications for different disks by the same artist and the same performance .	0
2123	for example , jimi hendrix 's 2 cd live at the fillmore east had one cd classifed as classic rock and the other psychidelic rock .	0
2124	perhaps the weirdest was one of bruce springsteen 's cds from the tracks set being classified as goth rock .	0
2125	you can change any of these , but need to be paying attention when the information is downloaded before you copy it .	1
2126	a somewhat more troublesome problem is that the internet site will sometimes give different discs of the same set slightly different names .	0
2127	this will cause the discs not to show up together when you are looking for them on the nomad .	0
2128	again , you can change this , but it 's harder to spot a minor variation in the title when you do n't have the title of the other disk in front of you .	0
2129	other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .	0
2130	if you have two tracks with exactly the same name on one disk , it will not copy both -- it gives you the option of skipping the second or overwriting the first with the second .	0
2131	this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music , but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi .	0
2132	i also had it happen when recording a jazz set where there were a number of outtakes of the same song without numbering them separately .	0
2133	the way to fix this is to rename the track by adding a number yourself to the end of the track listing .	1
2134	also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore  the  when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .	0
2135	finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .	0
2136	in other words , to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist , you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it .	0
2137	you do n't have this problem if you make your playlist from the nomad , where cds are listed separately .	0
2138	you need your computer , however , if you want to add tracks to a playlist .	1
2139	these are minor problems , and i list them to save anyone else the trouble of discovering them .	0
2140	had i not been in such a hurry to load cds , i would have spotted them sooner .	0
2141	also , if i had already loaded and tagged by cds on my home computer , this would not have been an issue .	0
2142	the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product .	0
2143	apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly .	0
2144	simply not as friendly for functional as an ipod .	0
2145	even better , ipod integrates perfectly with itunes so that managing music is a snap .	0
2146	i just got a 40gb ipod to replace my zen ( a 20gb model ) .	0
2147	while the ipod 's form factor is much nicer , here 's where the zen is better .	0
2148	a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .	0
2149	first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .	0
2150	the ipod is a one way only machine - from computer to player .	0
2151	the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .	0
2152	second , the  automatic  sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .	0
2153	since the ipod lacks this review feature on its auto-sync and it only allows one-way transfers , the first time i connected my ipod to my laptop , i wiped out the 20gb of music i had transferred from my desktop to the ipod .	0
2154	if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !	1
2155	the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .	0
2156	third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .	0
2157	only thing missing from creative is a cd burner .	0
2158	lastly , ipod / itunes will not play wma formatted songs .	0
2159	if you have a lot of those , be prepared to convert to mp3 .	0
2160	itunes does what apple is famous for , makes software that works for the less computer saavy .	0
2161	for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .	0
2162	player controls :	0
2163	here 's where the ipod drives me nuts .	0
2164	the player controls are too easy to hit accidentally .	0
2165	if you happen to push the wrong button , you can wipe out the order of songs you had put in .	0
2166	the ipod also does not let you see what 's coming up next on the player .	0
2167	zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .	0
2168	it also lets you remove songs from the play order .	0
2169	if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .	0
2170	you have to skip to the next track when your hated song comes up with the ipod .	0
2171	lastly , you cannot manage anything on the ipod itself .	0
2172	while you can create a temporary playlist , you can 't store it permanently , delete songs , search very easily , etc.	0
2173	none of these features are available because of the ipod 's 1-way transfers - you cannot make changes on the ipod that are premanent .	0
2174	again , the ipod is a beautiful thing to look at and touch , player controls are less functional .	0
2175	i think the ipod versus zen typifies differences between apple and win machines .	0
2176	win software can be a little cranky , but much more easier to customize to your needs .	0
2177	with apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it .	0
2178	if i had to do this again , i might get the 40gb zen .	0
2179	its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus.	0
2180	i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since .	0
2181	i was planning on getting an ipod , but i changed my mind last minute ... mostly because of the whole battery issue , i do n't have the patience for those sorta things .	0
2182	my cuzin got an ipod and i wo n't say it is an awful product , but i will say that for the price , apple could do better as far as storage and battery life goes .	0
2183	the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as  sexy  looking .	0
2184	i got this player for christmas & this was my first time using an mp3 player .	0
2185	i have a large collection of cds and have loaded over 100 of them so far .	0
2186	the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered .	0
2187	as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !	1
2188	the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road !	0
2189	i have tried the belkin tunecast mobile fm transmitter but found there was too much interference .	0
2190	overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it .	0
2191	i purchased this mp3 player just last night after doing some scouting around .	0
2192	here 's a basic run-down from what i learned :	0
2193	flash card memory vs. hard drive ( i.e. why does a 256 mb player cost $$$...and a 40 gb ( 40,000 mb ) player only cost	0
2194	mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them .	0
2195	the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact .	0
2196	that 's why you have these things that can be keychain size .	0
2197	mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory .	0
2198	i am averaging 4.5 mb per song , to give you an idea of how many songs you can get by the amount of memory .	0
2199	( 1 gb = 1,000 mb )	0
2200	hard drives ( this is what most ipods have - and just about all mp3 players over 3-5 gb of memory ) .	0
2201	cheaper to produce , holds a lot , heavier and has moving parts which means it 's a little more prone to damage from being banged around .	0
2202	that said , they are pretty sturdy machines and i would n't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory .	0
2203	just be aware of it .	0
2204	this explains why you see what appears to be such weird pricing on mp3 players .	0
2205	a 256 mb player ( roughly 60 songs for me ) is about x amount of dollars but a 30 gb ( 30,000 mb ) player ( roughly 6,650 songs ) sells for only slightly more .	0
2206	it 's because the 256 player uses flash memory ( smaller / lighter ) and the 30gb uses a hard drive .	0
2207	that 's the first thing to understand .	0
2208	so consider what you 're going to use the device for .	1
2209	if you 're a jogger and you want to strap it to your arm , i 'd recommend flash memory .	1
2210	if you want to listen to tunes while you travel , i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books .	1
2211	review of zen xtra - 40 gb	0
2212	the device is larger than an ipod of similar capacity .	0
2213	this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .	0
2214	it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly .	0
2215	the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .	0
2216	as some other reviewers noted , after it was connected to the computer for a bit , it somehow stopped reading the player so i had to replug it .	0
2217	it did not lock up my computer or require a reboot .	0
2218	the software lets you pop in a cd and then scans the internet to name the artist , track name and album name .	0
2219	extremely convenient .	0
2220	then it rips the tunes into mp3s and puts them on your computer .	0
2221	you can even skip that step and rip them directly from the cd to the player .	1
2222	( wo n't leave copy on your computer . )	0
2223	the pros and cons of it :	0
2224	great price .	0
2225	the ipod costs more for the same amount of memory .	0
2226	i thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all .	0
2227	the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal .	0
2228	it also stores data so i can see myself placing some data files on here .	0
2229	it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it .	0
2230	for me , that was the only drawback .	0
2231	i 'm really happy with this purchase .	0
2232	also , when i installed the software , it said that windows xp had n't approved something with the drivers , etc - and that continuing it install may cause instability .	0
2233	if you 're like me , that will definitely make you pause .	0
2234	after i reviewed the manual ( a pdf file included on the cd ) , i felt better because they warned you about the message and said it would n't cause problems and , in fact , it has n't .	0
2235	so if you have xp , be prepared for this and do n't be alarmed .	0
2236	if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .	1
2237	i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .	0
2238	i got this a while ago knowing nothing about it .	0
2239	it is a beast .	0
2240	if i wasnt a runner i would take a bullet in the foot for my nomad jukebox .	0
2241	now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .	0
2242	there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .	0
2243	but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything .	1
2244	ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .	0
2245	granted this is cheaper than an ipod .	0
2246	cheaper in every way .	0
2247	its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket .	0
2248	its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) .	0
2249	it also has unproven battery life .	0
2250	everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies .	0
2251	use this for 18 months every day and see what happens , or look at a 2 year old electric razor and see if it holds the same charge as the first day you had it ) .	0
2252	while it is an alternative to the ipod and one of the few viable ones its just that , an alternative and why would anyone seek an alternative to something that really needs no alternative choice because theres nothing wrong and everything right with it .	0
2253	i 'd like to see how well a small company supports its mp3 player in 2 years when its battery dies as all rechargeable do .	0
2254	finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .	0
2255	before anyone says hey you have n't used the product , i have , my friend received one for christmas instead of an ipod and has since envied me for my vastly superior product .	0
2256	* price and capacity	0
2257	* slick-looking design and improved interface	0
2258	* removable battery	0
2259	* protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window .	0
2260	had to cut out a window using a swiss army knife .	0
2261	how did this gigantic flaw go unnoticed by creative ?	0
2262	* scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models .	0
2263	does n't always register push-button movement .	0
2264	* eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files .	0
2265	i have to rip everything as a 160 kbps wma file ( as opposed to 128 kbps mp3 ) to avoid hearing digital garbling .	0
2266	* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ).	0
2267	* software is absolutely terrible :	0
2268	-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ).	0
2269	-- > does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library .	0
2270	-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .	0
2271	-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .	0
2272	if you have any multi-disc box sets , you 'll notice that the artist 's name , album name , and genre will often change with every disc .	0
2273	final verdict :	0
2274	a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .	0
2275	after investigating a multitude of player options , i asked for and received the 60 gb zen xtra for christmas .	0
2276	despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box !	0
2277	i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57,000 mb of free memory available to me .	0
2278	file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2.0 .	0
2279	several people have complained of difficulty transferring multiple songs with the same title .	0
2280	this is possible ! !	0
2281	since the zen xtra does not use a folder structure , the  duplicate name  problem stems from the actual file name , not from the song 's title / artist / album .	0
2282	simply configure the mediasource software ( or windows media player , or your ripper-du-jour ) to create file names that include artist and ( especially ) album names in addition to track names .	0
2283	using this method , i have not once encountered a situation where a track was rejected , and i have plenty of duplicate tracks on live and compilation albums .	0
2284	even if there happened to be identical track titles on the same disc , you could still edit the file name manually and get them both onto the player .	0
2285	my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the  year  field .	0
2286	how does it sound ?	0
2287	to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .	0
2288	no complaints there .	0
2289	the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train .	0
2290	navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .	0
2291	at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .	0
2292	i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift .	0
2293	i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .	0
2294	the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .	0
2295	plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .	0
2296	the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .	0
2297	this is a powerful piece of equipment .	0
2298	it is great to no longer wonder what music i want to take with me for a cross country flight or a two week trip - now i just take everything .	0
2299	ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .	0
2300	considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .	0
2301	before jumping on the ipod train , take a look at this marvel .	1
2302	i 'll state up front that i do not own a zen xtra and have not used one at all .	0
2303	but you might find my review useful , nonetheless .	0
2304	i purchased a jukebox 3 from creative almost a year ago .	0
2305	two months ago , an internal part failed ( not due to customer abuse ; it just failed ) .	0
2306	i got an rma from creative , sent my player in to them for repairs .	0
2307	it took them twice as long to get to my unit as they said .	0
2308	moreover , they want a total of $ 107 to repair it .	0
2309	( this includes the $ 20 that you have to pay up front , just to get them to look at your player . )	0
2310	if creative offered a 12-month warranty on their mp3 players , i 'd be covered .	0
2311	but they offer only a 3-month warranty ( on all of their players , including the zen xtra ) .	0
2312	so i 'm screwed .	0
2313	but you do n't have to be .	0
2314	if you buy a creative mp3 player , be sure to get the optional extended warranty .	1
2315	or better yet , buy from another company that stands behind their products with a 12-month warranty .	1
2316	it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .	0
2317	i shopped around for a while before buying a hard-drive mp3 player .	0
2318	i read reviews , compared specs , and visited user forums .	0
2319	despite all the hype about ipods , i knew i wanted something different , because i wanted more storage than the ipod i could afford would offer , and because i wanted more flexibility in where i purchased music online .	0
2320	after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .	0
2321	i purchased it at a retail store , and got an extended warranty .	0
2322	first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .	0
2323	it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .	0
2324	creative also sells batteries via its website , so there 's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery .	0
2325	the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use .	0
2326	point the  media sniffer  to your music files and let it do the rest .	1
2327	you can create playlists , drag & drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player .	0
2328	and with usb 2.0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .	0
2329	you can also delete songs from the player itself , and create playlists - on the fly - on your player .	0
2330	the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .	0
2331	i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well .	0
2332	they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department .	0
2333	i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .	0
2334	there are plenty other features that i have n't checked out , but i 'm sure i soon will .	0
2335	it ships with a carrying case that has a belt clip on it .	0
2336	however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off .	0
2337	it happened to me once .	0
2338	so now i keep it in my pocket .	0
2339	also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .	0
2340	it would have been better to have some sort of window on teh carrying case , so you could see the display without opening it .	0
2341	that 's my only real complaint about the nomad zen xtra , though .	0
2342	this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .	0
2343	zen good points :	0
2344	1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .	0
2345	2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous .	0
2346	the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click .	0
2347	1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?	0
2348	mediasource did not recognize my tags !	0
2349	my choices at that moment were to manually re-tag my music or re-rip using mediasource .	0
2350	i do n't think so .	0
2351	btw , if you * are * ripping your cds , mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct & uncluttered ] tag information .	0
2352	2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax .	0
2353	after about 45 mins of listening there was audible static in the player .	0
2354	when i turned eax off the static disappeared .	0
2355	when i turned eax back on the static was also not present .	0
2356	creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static .	0
2357	is eax faulty ?	0
2358	is my unit defective ?	0
2359	was i just unlucky at that moment ?	0
2360	was it a full moon that night ?	0
2361	i have n't figured it out yet .	0
2362	3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws .	0
2363	do not underestimate this in your purchase decision .	1
2364	many reviewers refer to it as  clunky  or  difficult  - heed their warnings .	1
2365	some amazon reviewers say it corrrupted their music files ;	0
2366	i did n't use it long enough to know , but clearly you need to use it with caution .	1
2367	4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) .	0
2368	in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .	0
2369	my goal of using it as a music player * and * data storage device has not been met ; do n't make the same mistake .	0
2370	5 . the zen does not have a stop button !	0
2371	you can stop playback by pressing 2 buttons , first the pause button , then the  next track  or  previous track  button .	0
2372	but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .	0
2373	to discover this i had to read about 10 online reviews ( with many complaints about the lack of stop button ) before i found one reviewer who was smart enough to both figure it out & document it .	0
2374	6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .	0
2375	if you are buying a zen xtra check whether the battery recharges via usb ; it does not on the zen nx .	1
2376	7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook .	0
2377	it referred to a  microsoft jet database engine  error and the install program suggested i download a service pack from the ms website to fix the problem ;	0
2378	i did that and re-installed the software but had the same error .	0
2379	creative provided e-mail support ;	0
2380	i followed their advice but that failed , too .	0
2381	i experimented with installing mediasource on 2 other computers at home and it worked fine .	0
2382	so it is probably  just bad luck  on my part that the personal notebook i own had this install error .	0
2383	however , it did motivate me to find a work-around solution .	0
2384	third party software to the rescue	0
2385	after much frustration ( above ) i found the notmad explorer ; cute product name for software that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer & organization problems .	0
2386	i am not associated with the company , i am not providing a url , but search for notmad and you should find it pretty easily .	0
2387	this provides drag & drop transfers of music between the computer & zen ; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist ; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen ( .	0
2388	m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !	0
2389	notmad has other features too , but this is not an advertisement so please see the company 's web site for more information ...	1
2390	if i knew then what i know now i would have paid the extra to get an ipod & avoided the zen .	0
2391	given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .	0
2392	and i am hoping the static i heard when using eax was a blip ...	0
2393	to summarize , i am using the creative zen as a mobile device ;	0
2394	i am using musicmatch to rip & catalog ( and if i choose , download ) music ;	0
2395	i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer .	0
2396	the only creative software i am using is the device driver ( s ).	0
2397	this is one of those items that , at first glance , looked cool but did n't really ring a bell with me .	0
2398	now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it !	0
2399	i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .	0
2400	the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !	0
2401	it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device .	0
2402	i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .	0
2403	i was cruising around the device within 20 minutes .	0
2404	the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .	0
2405	one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .	0
2406	my one recommendation to creative is to get some marketing people to work on the names of these things .	0
2407	they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .	0
2408	whereas some folks have the  ipod  , i have the  nomad jukebox zen xtra  ( not to be confused with the  nomad jukebox zen nx  ) .	0
2409	minor gripe .	0
2410	i can 't imagine why i would spend hundreds of dollars more to have an ipod .	0
2411	i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason .	0
2412	in a quick summation , here is what i found .	0
2413	+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .	0
2414	i had downloaded about 1000 songs and had room for another 9000 !	0
2415	it may have taken several years to fill this up .	0
2416	+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .	0
2417	- the software that came with it was tough to load .	0
2418	i got weird messages about it not being ok 'd by microsoft ( or something like that ) , then i thought it failed to load , then it loaded .	0
2419	- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .	0
2420	not good if you 're taking this traveling .	0
2421	the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective )	0
2422	- the cover that came with it did n't fit very well	0
2423	- the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage .	0
2424	i was n't sure how long it would take before it would break .	0
2425	- this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last .	0
2426	i spent much time debating on whether i should go with the zen xtra or the ipod .	0
2427	i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra ... and i was not disappointed .	0
2428	the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .	0
2429	navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .	0
2430	many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .	0
2431	i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision .	0
2432	i cannot recommend it enough ! !	1
2433	i recently bought the nomad jukebox zen xtra , and did n't even get as far as charging the battery .	0
2434	the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player .	0
2435	this gap allowed the front panel to fly off after barely being touched .	0
2436	i can 't comment on the quality of the audio , because it was back at the store before i ripped a single cd .	0
2437	i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for .	0
2438	if the casing of the player is this bad , i can 't image that the hardware is of very good quality .	0
2439	do n't be pulled in by the great price -- you get what you pay for , and there 's a reason this model is so cheap .	1
2440	like many reviewers , i really wanted to like this product .	0
2441	the price / performance looked just right .	0
2442	when i bought it late last year , there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal , but it sounded like a fair tradeoff .	0
2443	boy was i wrong .	0
2444	reading the reviews , it looks as though people really love this device for a month or two and then come to hate it .	0
2445	that 's been my experience .	0
2446	if i 'd been paying attention , i would have noticed the 3 month warranty .	0
2447	but i did n't because i 'm used to electronic products having a 12 month warranty .	0
2448	now i know better .	0
2449	i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose .	0
2450	a $ 300 device and they skimped on the headphone jack ?	0
2451	so now i 've got to call their customer  service  ( of course , no 800 number ) to send the thing back .	0
2452	from the other reviews i 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles .	0
2453	i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy .	0
2454	now let 's talk about the software .	0
2455	like other reviewers , installation was hell .	0
2456	subsequent behavior even worse .	0
2457	about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc .	0
2458	after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all .	0
2459	in fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered .	0
2460	finally , i uninstalled and reinstalled the software , the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing .	0
2461	to my amazement , even that process was error-prone .	0
2462	it took several days of attempts before things finally  worked  again and i have n't a clue why .	0
2463	that does n't leave me with a good feeling about its future stability .	0
2464	i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .	0
2465	but that 's a moot point now .	0
2466	my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .	0
2467	my gut tells me i 'll also end up buying an ipod .	0
2468	which means that in trying to save a few hundred dollars , i 'll end up spending more than twice that .	0
2469	be forewarned .	0
2470	i would have given a 3 to 5 star review in my first few weeks , depending on how mad i felt about the crummy software .	0
2471	now , even 1 star seems like i 'm giving creative the benefit of the doubt .	0
2472	i will never buy a creative product again .	0
2473	i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing .	0
2474	no way , now i have an ipod and i 'm a very happy man .	0
2475	also bought a soundblaster card that they sold for the mac .	0
2476	within months they stopped supporting the new mac os .	0
2477	what kind of a company does that !	0
2478	carry your entire collection !	0
2479	1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's  unspecified  ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .	0
2480	with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .	0
2481	the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .	0
2482	2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection .	0
2483	3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .	0
2484	the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .	0
2485	4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ).	0
2486	5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .	0
2487	6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's .	0
2488	7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .	0
2489	i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine .	0
2490	8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ).	0
2491	a. the cddb downloads information for the cd that you insert such that you do not have to type in the track information such as album , artist , song title , etc.	0
2492	i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags .	0
2493	b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .	0
2494	c. i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer .	0
2495	9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .	0
2496	i have it connected to speakers for a nice musical alarm in the morning .	0
2497	10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc. , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter .	0
2498	11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player	0
2499	12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) !	0
2500	1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it .	0
2501	2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre , artist , album , etc. ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information .	0
2502	this was not a problem for me as most of my collection was ripped from my own cds and i updated the id3 tags on my downloaded music .	0
2503	3 ) folders cannot be created for the audio files .	0
2504	this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags .	0
2505	the workaround is to update id3 tags on your files ( through mediasource ) but it can be a hassle if you have many such music files .	1
2506	4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .	0
2507	5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .	0
2508	both creative and third-party powered speakers work great , as do third-party wireless transmitters .	0
2509	a dock is unnecessary as the charger and usb cable do the necessary .	0
2510	6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed .	0
2511	i would have liked to be able to see what is playing without having to open the case .	0
2512	7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .	0
2513	once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player .	0
2514	this required patience as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it ( which i could do with my flash player ) .	0
2515	i did already have mediasource installed due to owning the creative audigy 2 soundcard but i did need to re-install it from the supplied cd as the older version did not have the connector to the zen .	0
2516	also , i downloaded the latest firmware upgrade and software updates .	0
2517	1 ) buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive .	1
2518	2 ) buy a good pair of head-phones unless you already own one .	1
2519	3 ) use files with id3 tags - not a problem if your cds were ripped within the last year .	1
2520	4 ) a set of speakers and a wireless transmitter are accessories that will add to your player 's usability ( the latter will allow you to play it on your car radio , home receiver , etc. )	0
2521	5 ) handle the player with care - it is not meant to be dropped .	0

2523	pros summary :	0
2524	great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes	0
2525	cons summary :	0
2526	not plug & play ; relies on id3 ; no fm or recording	0
2527	can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go .	0
2528	my favorite is to play  any track  - am rediscovering my music !	0
2529	also love waking up to music with attached speakers .	0
2530	i got the 40gb jukebox zen xtra for christmas .	0
2531	so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out .	0
2532	i called creative and they said to send it in and they would decide if it in warranty .	0
2533	it 'll take 10-15 business days for them to decide form when they get it .	0
2534	nothing but hassle with this company .	0
2535	what kind of product goes out within a month ?	0
2536	this thing does its job .	0
2537	i 've compared and compared and compared .	0
2538	it was either the 40gb ipod or this one .	0
2539	i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com.	0
2540	the longest that i have n't charged it was maybe 3 days and that 's turning it off every now and then .	0
2541	replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 .	0
2542	the only thing i do n't like about this is the cover does suck .	0
2543	i dropped it from the couch , landed on carpet and the cover and battery flew out .	0
2544	it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman .	0
2545	headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature .	0
2546	the software sucks .	0
2547	it overrides songs so you have to go in there and put it your own titles especially if you have remixes .	0
2548	also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate .	0
2549	you discover this later when you 're listening to a song and it 's the wrong title , causing you to rename everything on your own .	0
2550	i was prepared to love it .	0
2551	i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up .	0
2552	now i have to return it and rip all my music again .	0
2553	good thing i got a replacement plan .	0
2554	wish it included somebody to re-rip all the songs .	0
2555	reading other reviews , i do n't think the replacement one will be any better .	0
2556	i 'm not looking forward to ripping my entire collection every month or two .	0
2557	maybe i 'll get lucky with the next one .	0
2558	kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that .	0
2559	software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad .	0
2560	i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive .	0
2561	i do n't want to install software and drivers on every computer i 'm ever at .	0
2562	makes me use it much less than i otherwise would .	0
2563	looking at the glowing reviews from people that have had this for a week or two , i kind of wish people would wait until they 've had a product a little while to review it .	0
2564	i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work .	0
2565	i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .	0
2566	i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .	0
2567	always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .	0
2568	tech support could n't figure it out and gave up .	0
2569	i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the  rigor  of a business traveler .	0
2570	i bought the 30gb zen xtra from a well-known national electronics store as soon as i saw they were advertising it for $ 219.99 .	0
2571	the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market .	0
2572	the biggest drawback that people have about the zen xtra is the software .	0
2573	fact is , it could n't be easier to use .	0
2574	these models now ship with creative 's mediasource program , which allows you to highlight the files on your computer that you want to add to your zen xtra , click a button , and transfer it straight to your player .	0
2575	assuming you have filled in all the id3 tags on your mp3s , you will not have any problem finding them on your zen xtra .	0
2576	sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .	0
2577	even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .	0
2578	the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily .	0
2579	the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .	0
2580	connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !	1
2581	get those mp3s off your hard drive , save space , and enjoy your massive music library .	1
2582	awesome feature .	0
2583	usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast .	0
2584	minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable .	0
2585	that is , if a folder on your computer called  mp3  has slayer ( thrash metal ) , stravinsky ( classical ) , and ice cube ( rap ) in it , you will only be able to play the contents of that folder by searching for the artists or genres manually .	0
2586	the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name .	0
2587	not a big hassle as many would have you think .	0
2588	2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called  unknown .	0
2589	i would recommend against using id3v2 tags , and stick with id3v1 only .	1
2590	when the previous versions of the zens were shipped with musicmatch , people had this problem because musicmatch creates both sets of tags , which seem to confuse the zen xtra .	0
2591	take the time to fill in those tags !	0
2592	3 ) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software .	0
2593	in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % .	0
2594	so what are you waiting for ?	0
2595	get one now !	1
2596	i received this as a gift for christmas .	0
2597	my first impression was positive .	0
2598	after using it for a few weeks ( the amount of time before the hard drive crashed ) it revealed a few of its shortcommings .	0
2599	first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .	0
2600	at first i thought it was my headphones but it was not .	0
2601	it was just a problem with the player .	0
2602	second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed .	0
2603	the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .	0
2604	the general button placement is not very user friendly .	0
2605	this would not be a great problem if you did n't have so much info to scroll through on a regular basis .	0
2606	third , the poor design continues with the case .	0
2607	the flap completely covers the screen because there is no window to see it .	0
2608	it also covers over the power jack when closed .	0
2609	after the first one fatally crashed , the replacement did not work .	0
2610	i bought an ipod and am very happy with it .	0
2611	overall , a good buy for the price .	0
2612	easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll / pushbutton .	0
2613	my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of .	0
2614	there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours !	0
2615	at best , i 've gotten 3 hours + .	0
2616	i 've tried draining it until it wo n't turn on & recharging it overnight .	0
2617	no difference .	0
2618	if you 're intrested in buying a spare battery it 'll run you another $ 50 , a little steep i thought .	0
2619	i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times .	0
2620	the good news is if you can 't get it to reset / reboot you can still pull the battery and reinstall it .	0
2621	that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty .	0
2622	the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .	0
2623	at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice .	0
2624	pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery	0
2625	battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive	0
2626	note : about 2gb ( 5 % ) of the advertised 40gb of storage capacity is used for the operating software ( firmware ) .	0
2627	this is nothing new , every mp3 player , memory card , etc. , used for digital media today has some kind of preloaded operating software on it .	0
2628	what 's going on creative labs ?	0
2629	is it a coincidence that i no longer can get any of your nomad zen xtras ( worst name ever ) at best buy and now the 60gb nomad xtra is  sold out  or more likely  discontinued  at the almighty amazon.com ?	0
2630	if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod , creative zen , rio karma and iriver ihp - you 'll notice that each has their pros and cons ; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later .	0
2631	if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet .	1
2632	all the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet ; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while .	1
2633	if you are ok paying $ x00 for something that can be used now , but is likely to both get better and cost less in the future then try to determine which device is the lesser of evils for you .	1
2634	ipod clearly has the most buzz .	0
2635	great design and looks cool .	0
2636	most people love the appearance and praise the touch sensitive buttons .	0
2637	it has a hold button to deactivate the buttons to avoid accidents ; however , enough reviewers have complained that the hold button is easily broken and then the device can 't be used .	0
2638	some of the more geeky ( non-apple type ) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this apple-like interface .	0
2639	everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction .	0
2640	ipod can be used as an external disk , and apparently stores files without problem .	0
2641	however , the music and data are apparently not separated ; ipod reviewers complain about  white noise  in random feedback mode that comes from appointments / contacts created on the ipod during synchronization .	0
2642	synchronizing music among computers , if you have more than one , seems to be an issue ; research this before buying if you have multiple computers you want to be synchronized .	1
2643	reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .	0
2644	reviews of apple 's support are generally poor ; they seem to address issues in warranty , which covers a short time after delivery / pickup of item .	0
2645	after that it seems like you 're on your own .	0
2646	ipod has no stop button ; when new users mention this ipod veterans call it  unnecessary  and  so 20th century  .	0
2647	creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack .	0
2648	construction quality is a difficult item .	0
2649	the zen has a detachable face plate that allows the battery to be replaced .	0
2650	what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .	0
2651	drop if just a few inches on a hard surface and the faceplate pops off ( but not if it 's in its case ) .	0
2652	many reviewers say the faceplate simply did n't fit well so they returned the zen .	0
2653	feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products .	0
2654	the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .	0
2655	the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers .	0
2656	enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .	0
2657	the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that  creates  folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .	0
2658	reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .	0
2659	the zen has no stop button .	0
2660	veteran zen users have explained how to stop if that 's what you want .	0
2661	the rio karma feedback suffers from sensitivity in the hard disk .	0
2662	it seems like movement , even small movement , causes skipping in playback and even the device freezing .	0
2663	if you plan to carry the device around ( it is a mobile device , right ? ) then this is something you might want to think about .	1
2664	karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity .	0
2665	usability ( button usage , feature selection , menu structure , display size and quality ) also has good feedback .	0
2666	repair seems to be an issue ; some say the repair do n't exist	0
2667	- you just have to buy a new player .	0
2668	perhaps because of its smaller user base there is also a lack of accessories .	0
2669	like the zen , the karma does not support folders and is not designed to be a data storage device .	0
2670	it only comes in 20gb ; enough for most people , not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates .	0
2671	the karma does have a stop button .	0
2672	there are n't many reviews for the iriver ihp .	0
2673	those that have it like it .	0
2674	the only complaint seems to be that the disk rotation is slow , leading to longer delays in some functions ( playback and even a slow display of the menu ? ) .	0
2675	otherwise feedback seems to be good .	0
2676	no comments on reliability , warranty , repairs , accessories .	0
2677	no-one mentions whether there is a stop button , but the photos do n't show one .	0
2678	none of these are perfect .	0
2679	if you have the appetite choose the one that you think has the least deficiencies or is best suited to you .	1
2680	accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less .	0
2681	if that is for you then pay the money , learn from the experience and you 'll be a more informed buyer when you buy device # 2 .	1
2682	if you are n't into paying $ x00 to learn and experiment , or the cons outweigh the pros , then wait a year or so .	1
2683	sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod .	0
2684	but with a low price , comes lower quality .	0
2685	our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .	0
2686	the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap .	0
2687	it lasted about 1 1/2 weeks .	0
2688	i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out .	0
2689	i tried re-setting it , i tried just about every pair of headphones in my house ( 10 pairs ) , and nothing worked .	0
2690	so i contacted customer service at creative , but they said ,  if the product seems broken , we cannot help ,  or something to that effect .	0
2691	do n't get me wrong , the thing was like heaven for about a week .	0
2692	if you want a quality mp3 player , splurge on an ipod .	1
2693	if you really need to save , buy this thing on amazon , they eventually gave me a full refund .	1
2694	i bought myself an rca mp3-cd player , and i 'm happy with that until a cheap , worthwhile mp3 player coomes out .	0
2695	i bought the player this week and i like it by far .	0
2696	this is my fourth mp3 player ( creative nomad jukebox2 and 3 , rio chie , and this one ) , and my third player from creative .	0
2697	here 's something you have to know before you considering about buying this one .	1
2698	pro : 1 .	0
2699	removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .	0
2700	my friend has an i-pod for about 2 years and the battery has so so messed up .	0
2701	his i-pod can only play for a couple of hours with a fully recharging now .	0
2702	value : comparing data storage with price .	0
2703	size and style :	0
2704	the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) .	0
2705	the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )	0
2706	easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this	0
2707	the software , mediasource , cannot work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2.0 , xp os ) .	0
2708	a tons of reveiws has reported this problem and the same here .	0
2709	in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .	0
2710	however , the creative lab did come out new update to fix their software problems .	0
2711	i am crossing my finger and wish they will fix the problem .	0
2712	ps : ( mediasource provides similar functions with ms mediaplay such like cd ripping , tagging , music database managing , music file transfering , and more )	0
2713	now i use ms mediaplayer , musicmatch ( free downladed ) , and  explorer / my computer / grab files from disk c or d into the player  to replace the mediasource .	0
2714	in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software	0
2715	alright , well i read alot of these reviews , and i read alot of bad and good things about this player .	0
2716	well to say , i had a very bad history with players .	0
2717	one broke , one got stolen , and then i bought the riovolt sp - 350 .	0
2718	if you are planning to buy that player , do not !	1
2719	that player is a complete piece of sh ***.	0
2720	i returned it once , then i sent it back , and it is crap .	0
2721	now getting back to this .	0
2722	i ordered this player for christmas , and so far i have it for only 2 weeks .	0
2723	now as others said , so far this player is an awesome player , there are flaws .	0
2724	the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly	0
2725	huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you .	0
2726	( 28 not 30 because software itself takes space ) .	0
2727	and those songs mostly are 320 kbps.	0
2728	the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .	0
2729	with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .	0
2730	if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .	1
2731	you can also search for your song , which is good .	0
2732	i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome .	0
2733	you can easily access ur files , and easily fill in the id3 tags , which can take a while with a big collection of music , but if your not lazy , you will do it without a problem .	0
2734	and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3 , so its not a problem .	0
2735	battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours .	0
2736	when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .	0
2737	you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .	0
2738	you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of  now playing  interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .	0
2739	there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .	0
2740	there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful .	0
2741	the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .	0
2742	the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption .	0
2743	the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life .	0
2744	the product manufacturer promised me 14 hours , and what i recieved was 6-8 .	0
2745	5 hours max. i did it like this	0
2746	eax on : 6 hours eax off : 8.5 hours	0
2747	the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .	0
2748	you need the software to actually transfer files	0
2749	the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings .	0
2750	also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .	0
2751	( but as any hard drive , all of them freeze at certain points )	0
2752	well thats about it , and as people said in earlier previews that the headfone jack gets messed up , stil havent happened to me , and i hope it doesnt .	0
2753	and also , it 's priced very affordably .	0
2754	with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more .	0
2755	a similarily priced 15gb ipod would n't have been nearly enough room .	0
2756	having my entire music collection is great when travelling ( both on plane and car trips ) and i do n't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player -- it 's all there .	0
2757	having to copy / delete files would be time-consuming and is rendered a non-issue with 40gb of storage .	0
2758	the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's  notmad  software because of some advanced features i wanted .	0
2759	the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones .	0
2760	on planes i use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good .	0
2761	sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .	0
2762	accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .	0
2763	possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .	0
2764	since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .	0
2765	try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .	1
2766	i personally am not crazy about the looks of either the ipod or the nomad .	0
2767	the ipod 's white plastic look / surface does n't suit me .	0
2768	i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy .	0
2769	the mini ipod 's look the best to me -- but with only 4gb there 's no way i would ever buy any mp3 player with a measly 4gb of storage .	0
2770	my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them .	1
2771	i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it .	0
2772	the pros :	0
2773	almost half what an ipod would cost you !	0
2774	i do n't care how it looks and i always drive so the size is not important to me .	0
2775	sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization .	0
2776	yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway .	0
2777	i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough .	0
2778	i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !	0
2779	creative software stinks .	0
2780	it 's horrible .	0
2781	redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more !	0
2782	the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day .	0
2783	have had the player since xmass and love it !	0
2784	great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .	0
2785	short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .	0
2786	i did n't even try the included software .	0
2787	i just bought notmad manager ( $ 25 ) and file transfers are easy drag and drop , songs stored by id3 tags not by folders , needs to have software on computer to transfer files , no window on case ( nice case otherwise .	0
2788	this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .	0
2789	for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .	0
2790	here are the pros and cons ( few there are ) in detail :	0
2791	look / design :	0
2792	the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods .	0
2793	it 's bigger , but people have grossly exaggerated the size differences - it 's only about half an inch longer and 1/3 inch thicker than the new-generation ipods .	0
2794	it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .	0
2795	i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .	0
2796	the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .	0
2797	the screen 's large and easily read .	0
2798	the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .	0
2799	sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod .	0
2800	from what i 've heard it 's at least equal .	0
2801	like others have mentioned , you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they 're on lower bit levels .	0
2802	there 's no so-called background hiss that i 've noticed , at least so far .	0
2803	interface - practically seamless .	0
2804	songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags , which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver .	0
2805	yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy .	0
2806	it 's a dedicated music playing device , anyway , so this serves it better .	0
2807	you can find any song quicky by an artist , album , or genre search .	0
2808	playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options .	0
2809	the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance .	0
2810	as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better .	0
2811	it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files .	0
2812	the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .	0
2813	it was no problem for me to use their software .	0
2814	some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive .	0
2815	the software and design are geared towards enhancing the music experience .	0
2816	overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .	0
2817	so far , however , i 'm a very happy customer .	0
2818	please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .	1
2819	do n't buy this player .	1
2820	i recently bought this after my archos 20 multimedia self-destructed ( do n't get me started on that piece of junk ! ) and expected it to be flawless .	0
2821	unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is  player either not connected or busy .	0
2822	it will not load any further songs on and customer service has no idea what to do .	0
2823	do n't buy this player .	1
2824	do not buy this product --	1
2825	i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended .	0
2826	nearly 4000 songs went up in smoke .	0
2827	the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .	0
2828	ok , im writing yet another review , about a week from my previous one .	0
2829	honestly , i love this player .	0
2830	one horrible flaw , or mayybe more than one .	0
2831	once again , the sound is awesome , the batterly life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life .	0
2832	ok so i donno about what other people said , how the player breaks and stuff , and the headfone jack , fortunately that did not happen to me .	0
2833	however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .	0
2834	therefore im saying im returning it right now , and i will see wat happens with my next zen xtra ( same replacement ) .	0
2835	if that one fails too , and i hope if it does , let it happen in the first 90 days , not later , cuz thats the warranty .	0
2836	if it does , ill give up .	0
2837	basically wat happened , is that the hard drive failed .	0
2838	thats it .	0
2839	i cant do anything about it , and i have to send back .	0
2840	the only good thing about this whole process , is that im getting like a 34 dollar amount back , because of the price difference between when i bought it , and now .	0
2841	basically u can see that i have given the player 3 stars , instead of 1 .	0
2842	you know why ?	0
2843	because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .	0
2844	now honestly , i love this player , but with all seriousness , i would not recommend it to other people , because of the breakdown flaw. and i honestly would not recomment the people of the ipod , that crap sucks big donkey ..... never mind .	0
2845	i hope my next player doesnt breakdown . .	0
2846	honestly , the best players without any flaws were the goddam cd players .	0
2847	this is all i have to say .	0
2848	what a junk .	0
2849	every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .	0
2850	the only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode .	0
2851	so if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen os you can 't use nomad until you get home .	0
2852	after os froze twice on me in the subway i returned the jukebox .	0
2853	the reviews of this product can be roughly divided into two groups : ( 1 ) those who have had the product for a few weeks and ( 2 ) those have had the product for a few months .	0
2854	those who have had the nomad for a few weeks are mostly thrilled with it .	0
2855	the price is way below an ipod of the same size .	0
2856	the nomad is only sligtly larger than an ipod .	0
2857	the sound quality is very good .	0
2858	the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .	0
2859	because of the large capacity of the nomad , owners can load hundreds of cds on to it .	0
2860	for most people , they can carry around all or almost all of their music collection .	0
2861	having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .	0
2862	they fall in love with the product .	0
2863	and then it breaks .	0
2864	usually around the time the 90 day warranty expires .	0
2865	typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others .	0
2866	the nomad is sent back to creative labs .	0
2867	they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period , creative will charge you to fix it .	0
2868	in my case , the bill was $ 81 , about a third of what i paid for it .	0
2869	like many others , i had not abused the product , and had tried to take care of it .	0
2870	if my level of care was n't good enough , i had to expect that even if i paid to have it fixed it would break again in a month or two .	0
2871	i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use .	0
2872	the headphone jack seems to be a major problem .	0
2873	the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .	0
2874	the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .	0
2875	even if it has n't expired , creative is likely to claim that the owner caused the damage which in turn voids the warranty .	0
2876	and most stores will not take back a product 90 days after purchase .	0
2877	this means that you will have the nomad long enough to load a lot of music on to it , and get used to having it .	0
2878	so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad .	0
2879	you will find it very hard or impossible to get you money back .	0
2880	you will have a very expensive paperweight .	0
2881	there are not a lot of good options out there .	0
2882	most people say buy an ipod , but they are pretty expensive and also require you to send the product back to the factory just to replace the battery .	0
2883	my suggestion is to wait to see how the market develops .	0
2884	maybe creative will come out with a better design , although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again .	0
2885	maybe more competitors will bring out similar products .	0
2886	and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod .	0
2887	whatever you do , do n't buy this product .	1
2888	you will be sorry if you do .	0
2889	i am a soldier serving in baghdad right now .	0
2890	i bought the nomad when i went home on leave and it worked great for about a month .	0
2891	the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now .	0
2892	it says i have a harddisk problem .	0
2893	and since i 'm out here i can 't mail it back under my 90 days and they wo n't help me out cause they say that the conditions here are not covered under the warranty .	0
2894	it worked good for a while .	0
2895	it did lock up on me a couple of times .	0
2896	and then it just froze and now i 'm out $ 300 for their piece of junk .	0
2897	i first bought a 6 gig nomad jukebox ( original ).	0
2898	unfortunatly it was dropped and damaged a year after i bought it .	0
2899	the batteries would not charge .	0
2900	so i took it back to best buy where i bought it and exchanged it for a newer zen 20 gig model .	0
2901	in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .	0
2902	it 's nothing major , just a bad hard drive , any hard drive mp3 player can have that problem .	0
2903	so rule of thumb , no matter what you end up buying , get the extended warranty !	1
2904	it always pays off .	0
2905	hope i 've been of some help .	0
2906	this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .	0
2907	the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .	0
2908	it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .	0
2909	it is light enough to carry around all day without bother .	0
2910	operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie lebovitz , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .	0
2911	the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .	0
2912	the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .	0
2913	comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .	0
2914	i bought a 256 mb cf and a second battery , so it 's good to go on a long vacation .	0
2915	i enthusiastically recommend this camera .	1
2916	i got my camera three days back , and although i had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one , i still rate myself as a beginner .	0
2917	i bought this camera because it fit my budget and the pre-production and production model reviews were positive .	0
2918	it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich .	0
2919	in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .	0
2920	the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .	0
2921	the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject .	0
2922	the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .	0
2923	the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card , which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution , i intend to buy a bigger card soon .	0
2924	i love photography .	0
2925	i had an older camera that was simply a point and shoot camera .	0
2926	i needed something with more power , so i bought a nikon coolpix 4300 .	0
2927	i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .	0
2928	you can use the scene modes , or fine tune the options , i. you can change the iso level , shutter speed , etc.	0
2929	this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .	0
2930	i bought coolpix 4300 two months after i had bought canon powershot s400 .	0
2931	reason for two ?	0
2932	it was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid .	0
2933	the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing .	0
2934	i 've had no problem with canon whatsoever .	0
2935	with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;	0
2936	1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable .	0
2937	i did everything i could , and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader .	0
2938	card reader is included .	0
2939	2 . the speed is noticeably slower than canon , especially so with flashes on .	0
2940	3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip .	0
2941	i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar .	0
2942	be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries .	1
2943	the other reviewers have clearly pointed all the good things about this camera , which i do agree .	0
2944	but there are certain issues might be they are to me here - all of them are minor; not major ones though ,	0
2945	. this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped .	0
2946	would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .	0
2947	. if you want to have the date ; time on the image , its only through their software  nikon view  which reads the images date ; time from the images meta-data .	0
2948	so if you use your card reader ; copy images - you got to once again open them through their software to put the date ; time .	0
2949	in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time .	0
2950	. even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image	0
2951	. images taken indoor were n't so clear .	0
2952	you got to have flash ' on ' to get it eventhough your room is well lit	0
2953	. lens cap is a really annoying	0
2954	. go ; get a high speed like lexar 12x or higher cf card .	0
2955	else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately  fine ** picture quality   image size : 1600 .	0
2956	. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that .	0
2957	but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .	0
2958	i would rate this is 4.5 stars picture quality ; image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix .	0
2959	within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob .	0
2960	it became stucked which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes .	0
2961	i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .	0
2962	worse of all , they claim that it 's some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty !	0
2963	they would n't repair my camera unless if i pay $ 100 for parts ? and labor !	0
2964	it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .	0
2965	got a  system error  problem 30 days after purchase .	0
2966	made the camera totally inoperable .	0
2967	also , the lens cap design is flawed .	0
2968	you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it .	0
2969	audio on video also lacking .	0
2970	otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .	0
2971	still , had to send it back to nikon for repair .	0
2972	i am an amateur photographer and here is a piece of advise to all the folks who are thinking about making a move the digital world .	0
2973	nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price .	0
2974	here were my requirements in a digital camera :	0
2975	1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6  or 5x7  prints and i wanted some really great 8x10  photos once in a while .	0
2976	2 . i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was n't comfortable with that .	0
2977	i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily .	0
2978	3 . i wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although , i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings .	0
2979	4 . and , of course , i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had n't used it much .	0
2980	depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models .	0
2981	nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes , medium; compact size , price , brand name , good software that is included and previous reviews .	0
2982	i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since .	0
2983	the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .	0
2984	a few things that might make it even better :	0
2985	1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .	0
2986	2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow .	0
2987	3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .	0
2988	all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints .	0
2989	try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems .	1
2990	whichever camera you buy , add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card , usb card reader , camera bag and the warranty .	1
2991	and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness .	1
2992	hope this review has helped you in making up your mind .	0
2993	i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience .	0
2994	i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now .	0
2995	with our compact 35mm broken , and a vacation in europe at hand , i finally decided to enter the digital age .	0
2996	i first intended to buy the 3100 , but am really happy to invest the extra money for the 4300 .	0
2997	the lense is a lot better , and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures .	0
2998	the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful  scene  mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless .	0
2999	the movie mode is also working great .	0
3000	the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .	0
3001	a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on  normal  resolution .	0
3002	i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .	0
3003	even at the  normal  setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a  digital  .	0
3004	the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .	0
3005	i therefore bought a second battery as a backup , and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger , which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe , we ran never out of  juice  .	0
3006	i highly recommend the accessory kit , which provides you with everything else you need :	1
3007	a nice camera bag , which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger .	0
3008	furher it contains a card reader , a flash card folder for up to 8 cards , a lense cleaning rag , and an ac adapter , which is very helpful when working in an  outlet environment  .	0
3009	over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !	0
3010	after reading all the glowing review on this camera , i went to my local camera shop to try one .	0
3011	i currently own an olympus d-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures .	0
3012	however , indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy .	0
3013	anyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix .	0
3014	focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .	0
3015	pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry .	0
3016	pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent .	0
3017	the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models .	0
3018	anyway , i ended up purchasing the lumix .	0
3019	i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about .	0
3020	however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .	0
3021	i purchased the nikon 4300 after several weeks of searching .	0
3022	the value , name , and resolution signed the lease .	0
3023	after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures .	0
3024	the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !	0
3025	the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .	0
3026	i love all of the features , and presets as well .	0
3027	sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening !	0
3028	the software you get with this camera is perfect .	0
3029	touchups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct .	0
3030	i definately recommend a large memory card .	1
3031	i use a 128mb card , and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 1024-1280 res. , with good resolution .	0
3032	very large pics take 8mb each !	0
3033	battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargebles , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have .	1
3034	all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera .	0
3035	making the step from film to digital has been a great move .	0
3036	i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know .	0
3037	great camera , great investment !	0
3038	this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models .	0
3039	the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size .	0
3040	with an extra battery and a couple of good sized memory cards you are all set for a day of picture taking while on vacation .	0
3041	the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .	0
3042	if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300 , i would order another just like it .	0
3043	after much research i decided on the nikon coolpix 4300 .	0
3044	it has many great features and very few bad ones .	0
3045	it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .	0
3046	if you cant get great pics from this camera its because you havent read the manual .	0
3047	the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too .	0
3048	downloads are a snap and quick .	0
3049	controls easy yo use and easy to get to .	0
3050	i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .	0
3051	really happy with this little camera .	0
3052	it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes .	0
3053	got it for christmas , still learning a few of the settings , but i do n't take pictures every single day .	0
3054	settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .	0
3055	i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .	0
3056	did buy a 256mb compact flash , it holds a lot of pics at any resolution .	0
3057	i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions , but does n't seem any of the buget cameras do .	0
3058	still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !	0
3059	this is a wonderful camera .	0
3060	my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months .	0
3061	in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer 's remorse .	0
3062	4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price .	0
3063	one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .	0
3064	this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon. never knew i could love a digital camera so much .	0
3065	the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat. clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .	0
3066	100 % perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos .	1
3067	i took the camera and just gave it to someone .	0
3068	no instructions .	0
3069	just point and shoot and the photos were great .	0
3070	just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos .	0
3071	the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla .	0
3072	my pda becames a digital album .	0
3073	i have a 128mb card in it and can shoot over 150 hi res photos .	0
3074	if you have to buy a camera on a buget, this has got to be the one .	1
3075	go get it .	1
3076	before they are sold out !	0
3077	great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.	0
3078	i bought my nikon coolpix4300 about a week ago .	0
3079	this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .	0
3080	it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into .	0
3081	i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .	0
3082	my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !	0
3083	one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .	0
3084	i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus .	0
3085	battery life is ok .	0
3086	i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it .	0
3087	great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .	0
3088	i 've been using it for about 3 months now .	0
3089	i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly .	0
3090	the quality is superb .	0
3091	the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person .	0
3092	we use older versions 880 , 885 of this model in the office and i find them to produce excellent quality photos .	0
3093	the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust .	0
3094	it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade !	0
3095	we got a 256mb card , and have been hard-pressed to fill it over a weekend .	0
3096	the only drawbacks that i have noticed :	0
3097	it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .	0
3098	so , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging .	1
3099	it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .	0
3100	i would say that this is not a major issue , but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things .	0
3101	it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .	0
3102	for more , you sacrifice weight and size : more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length .	0
3103	it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality .	0
3104	i set the camera to the  manual  mode for one main reason :	0
3105	in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries .	0
3106	in manual , you can set it to  single af  where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features .	0
3107	in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models !	0
3108	it is easy to  focus  in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera .	0
3109	it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .	0
3110	for work , we use them in the field often , and they hold up really well .	0
3111	they take excellent macro shots as well .	0
3112	the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .	0
3113	i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money .	0
3114	the picturers are amazing .	0
3115	do n't waste time looking at anything else , just buy this one .	1
3116	it do n't get any better then the nikon 4300 .	0
3117	i am a nikon fan , and owned and used slr nikon fe , n50 and n90s for many many years .	0
3118	recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .	0
3119	i particularly like the  txt  file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take.	0
3120	the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .	0
3121	try to buy a high capacity ultra card , as it 's 2x as faster as the regular cf card .	1
3122	consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download , it 's well worth the little extra money .	1
3123	an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into  out of battery  situation .	0
3124	use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run .	1
3125	one thing puzzles me is that for  fine and 2200 +  quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .	0
3126	i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 1.2 mb/per .	0
3127	anybody can explain that ?	0
3128	a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .	0
3129	i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate .	1
3130	we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken .	0
3131	i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !	0
3132	first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake .	0
3133	for three months , i 've researched the internet and magazines , queried various sales personnel , and took hands-on in-store test drives .	0
3134	and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 .	0
3135	i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .	0
3136	the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .	0
3137	the shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more .	0
3138	uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .	0
3139	the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .	0
3140	right now , i 'm researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that 's designed for digital cameras .	0
3141	2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .	0
3142	i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died .	0
3143	an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment .	1
3144	3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust .	0
3145	i 'll still use my photosuite for editing .	0
3146	one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing .	0
3147	just for the heck of it , i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door , and the focusing was just fine .	0
3148	in summary , i love this camera and would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range .	1
3149	- since i wrote the review above in january 2003 , i still love this camera .	0
3150	i 've picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful .	0
3151	i bought a digi-slave dsf-1s flash unit .	0
3152	i do n't use a bracket , i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand .	0
3153	i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set .	0
3154	this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters .	0
3155	i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time .	0
3156	this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap .	0
3157	the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find .	0
3158	great camera .	0
3159	i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use .	0
3160	it takes great pictures .	0
3161	the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .	0
3162	it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .	0
3163	i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots .	0
3164	now where did i put that manual ?	0
3165	do n't let my five star rating fool you .	0
3166	the nikon coolpix 4300 deserves six .	0
3167	i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down .	0
3168	i was considering buying the minolta f-100 and the sony dsc-p 9 , but at the camera shop , realized this one went above and beyond .	0
3169	i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .	0
3170	autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all .	0
3171	i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card .	1
3172	buy this camera and savour it .	0
3173	i reviewed several digital cameras before settling on this one .	0
3174	this one was rated very high by several people check out this site and epinions.com .	0
3175	i have not been disappointed with my purchase .	0
3176	picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .	0
3177	on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .	0
3178	however , the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures .	0
3179	i am extremely satisfied with this camera .	0
3180	i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion .	0
3181	buy an extra battery - life is good but still somewhat short .	1
3182	do n't buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card .	1
3183	you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution .	0
3184	i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera 's controls are confusing and hard to remember :	0
3185	read the directions !	1
3186	the regular mode in this camera works for 80 % of settings .	0
3187	the  scene  mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a  regular  setting .	0
3188	i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos .	0
3189	however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .	0
3190	buy this camera , you wo n't regret it .	1
3191	if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 !	1
3192	after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .	0
3193	after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck .	0
3194	its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake .	0
3195	yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .	0
3196	the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .	0
3197	i own a 35mm slr camera and this is my second digital .	0
3198	if you 're seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer 's remorse and filled with cool , then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300 !	1
3199	had it for a week .	0
3200	there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !	0
3201	seriously ! i love it !	0
3202	my room is so dark and when i tried taking pics of it with my old camera , they came out black , but with this , they look the same in the picture as in real life .	0
3203	better actually cause my carpet looks clean , lol .	0
3204	but this camera is great !	0
3205	the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .	0
3206	i can 't connect it to my computer though , but that 's a problem with windows me , not the camera .	0
3207	if you have windows me you should upgrade to xp anyway , lol .	1
3208	but it works perfectly fine on my parent 's computer .	0
3209	it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .	0
3210	the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .	0
3211	ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet .	0
3212	i did quite a bit of research before buying this camera , and this one had everything i was looking for .	0
3213	it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into .	0
3214	it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .	0
3215	i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots .	0
3216	i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .	0
3217	i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .	0
3218	8mb for a camera like this is a joke .	0
3219	a card with more memory is a must .	1
3220	a minor quibble , since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards .	0
3221	if you do any research into digital cameras , you 'll quickly find that this camera is just about the best value out there .	0
3222	these are the reasons i think it 's great :	0
3223	1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want .	0
3224	2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .	0
3225	3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use .	0
3226	4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms .	0
3227	5 for  digital film  it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome .	0
3228	6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .	0
3229	7 picture quality is excellent .	0
3230	8 battery life is excellent .	0
3231	9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .	0
3232	10 great price for all the features .	0
3233	here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera :	0
3234	1 no direct firewire to the camera .	0
3235	there is usb , though .	0
3236	2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured .	0
3237	this does n't affect the picture , of course .	0
3238	you just have to use the lcd viewfinder to see the whole picture .	0
3239	it 's no problem for me personally .	0
3240	3 battery has to be removed to recharge .	0
3241	4 an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery 's out is not included , although one can be purchased separately .	0
3242	5 two different adapters -- ur-e 4 and ur-e 7 -- are required for some attachment lenses .	0
3243	most of these  annoyances  , though , are comparable to what you 'll find on other cameras in this price range .	0
3244	i am new to the whole digital camera thing ; well , new to the whole camera thing period , really .	0
3245	this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .	0
3246	the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n't played with it too much on manual .	0
3247	it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .	0
3248	overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera .	0
3249	awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package .	0
3250	the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc.	0
3251	in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .	0
3252	i am a business user who heavily depend on mobile service .	0
3253	there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .	0
3254	just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city / exchange you wanted .	1
3255	after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !	0
3256	i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .	0
3257	i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition .	0
3258	my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .	0
3259	the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .	0
3260	the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .	0
3261	the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it .	1
3262	the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint .	0
3263	after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .	0
3264	i 'd always eyed the nokia phones and had heard decent things about t-mobile , so i gave it a whirl .	0
3265	here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of  plastic-like  ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .	0
3266	it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio !	0
3267	i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .	0
3268	also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious .	0
3269	the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !	0
3270	the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .	0
3271	the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .	0
3272	however , it serves its purpose .	0
3273	the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --	0
3274	i checked with nokia .	0
3275	the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly .	0
3276	the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .	0
3277	more downside to this phone ?the volume .	0
3278	oh my goodness --	0
3279	i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .	0
3280	forget talking on it in public -- you just can 't hear the other person !	0
3281	on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .	0
3282	i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .	0
3283	i was surprised by t-mobile 's service .	0
3284	i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous .	0
3285	they piggy-back on cingular 's service .	0
3286	also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works .	0
3287	since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work  in 24 hours  .	0
3288	i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .	0
3289	24 hours ? by what time standards -- martian ?	0
3290	apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .	0
3291	also , they 'd forgotten to add  wap  capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out .	0
3292	in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .	0
3293	but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they 've answered all your questions , even if they did n't , to which they always seem to expect a  yes  answer from you .	0
3294	i realize this is for quality assurance purposes , but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered ( i.e. me :	0
3295	when will my t-zones work ?  , csr :	0
3296	i 'm not sure  . ) .	0
3297	umm , well , thanks for nothing .	0
3298	this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he 'd answered all my questions ( same interaction as i just described ) , and well .. .	0
3299	that was annoying .	0
3300	t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's .	0
3301	however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .	0
3302	and no t-zones .	0
3303	so what 's the point ?	0
3304	i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .	0
3305	i 've bought the very expensive sanyo 5500/vm4500 -- which i love -- and i 'm okay with my services .	0
3306	guess all that glitters is not gold .	0
3307	it was worth a shot -- too bad it did n't work out .	0
3308	hope someone else has better luck !	0
3309	i bought one of these phones in kuwait to use with the mtc prepaid telephone service ez because i would be able to use it when i return to the states with t-mobile .	0
3310	recently i accidently washed my telephone with my laundry through two complete 18 minute wash cycles of a washing machine .	0
3311	disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine , i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone .	0
3312	two days later the phone was returned to me in complete working order .	0
3313	while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .	0
3314	i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .	1
3315	i 've had an assortment of cell phones over the years ( motorola , sony ericsson , nokia etc. ) and in my opinion , nokia has the best menus and promps hands down .	0
3316	no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers .	0
3317	from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .	0
3318	whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio .	0
3319	wish it were a flip phone , but thats not a deal breaker !	0
3320	i have had this phone for about 5 months .	0
3321	i treat the battery well and it has lasted .	0
3322	at my heaviest usage , i must recharge after 3 days .	0
3323	it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls .	0
3324	signal strength will affect the battery life .	0
3325	frequent signal searches eat up battery power .	0
3326	i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover .	0
3327	i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at .	0
3328	the volume level of the phone is not all that good .	0
3329	some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .	0
3330	the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .	0
3331	the vibration is not top .	0
3332	it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in .	0
3333	i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it .	0
3334	vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this .	0
3335	so it was no loss .	0
3336	overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .	0
3337	great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .	0
3338	i do hope that they offer more faceplate options .	0
3339	i am bored with the silver look .	0
3340	it has a nice color screen .	0
3341	it is small .	0
3342	radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in .	0
3343	that is a major minus , but its not that bad .	0
3344	t-mobile was a pretty good server .	0
3345	it has 2 games .	0
3346	they are not wowable good .	0
3347	you have to buy better ones .	0
3348	it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !	0
3349	this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it .	0
3350	nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon .	0
3351	we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use .	0
3352	i 'll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back .	0
3353	i upgraded to a 6610 at my local t-mobile store .	0
3354	when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there :	0
3355	it defaulted to unchangeable email .	0
3356	so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support , only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem .	0
3357	i returned to the store , whereupon the clerk insisted that he could make it work ; he could n't .	0
3358	he spent another half hour on the phone with tech support , to no avail .	0
3359	so i had to give up and return it , having lost about 4 hours .	0
3360	while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .	0
3361	negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .	0
3362	poor visibility on the keys .	0
3363	you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them .	0
3364	the title says it all ...	0
3365	the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone  unlike the nokia 3650  and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make ...	0
3366	only con i can think of is no camera ... .	0
3367	no big deal for the size . .	0
3368	this phone is a winner ...	0
3369	anything this phone does , it does perfectly .	0
3370	the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .	0
3371	the speakerphone :	0
3372	this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone .	0
3373	as said before this works perfectly .	0
3374	you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance .	0
3375	the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly .	0
3376	you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly .	0
3377	only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .	0
3378	the radio :	0
3379	this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .	0
3380	this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .	0
3381	one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia .	0
3382	i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .	0
3383	the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .	0
3384	anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception .	0
3385	if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe .	0
3386	sold in other parts of the world :	0
3387	another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .	0
3388	this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .	0
3389	or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store , which are located in many countries in europe .	0
3390	i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service .	0
3391	able to use service in another country :	0
3392	if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time , you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country .	1
3393	you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country .	0
3394	size and weight :	0
3395	when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light .	0
3396	this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket .	0
3397	battery life :	0
3398	the battery life on this phone is surreal .	0
3399	it lasts , truly , 7 days on standby .	0
3400	i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar .	0
3401	it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light .	0
3402	this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .	0
3403	the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .	0
3404	overall , i highly recommend this phone .	1
3405	it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .	0
3406	i love the pros and cons reviews so here ya go :	0
3407	size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .	0
3408	sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .	0
3409	speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .	0
3410	surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available .	0
3411	ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .	0
3412	the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out .	0
3413	games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .	0
3414	nice little phone ... light compact . .	0
3415	great features . .	0
3416	buttons do seem a little sticky tho .. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem ..	0
3417	perhaps there is a tone of irony in the title of my review , but i actually mean it in earnest .	0
3418	after having had my heart broken by a sexy piece of hardware that simply would n't perform .	0
3419	i replaced it with this not-quite-so-dazzling , but definitely more functional device .	0
3420	although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .	0
3421	the reception and sound quality are top-notch .	0
3422	i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs , which is an unaccustomed luxury , even with t-mobile service .	0
3423	i like the size and weight of this little critter .	0
3424	i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed .	0
3425	the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .	0
3426	the fact that the  0  key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the  #  key instead .	0
3427	but that 's not an insurmoutable obstacle .	0
3428	the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .	0
3429	it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .	0
3430	there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient .	0
3431	the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .	0
3432	thumbs down on that one .	0
3433	the vibrate setting is loud !	0
3434	so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option .	0
3435	but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street .. .	0
3436	which was a good thing , because i realized i had forgotten my phone ...	0
3437	other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .	0
3438	i 'd like a camera phone , but i 'd rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls ...	0
3439	- no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking	0
3440	- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .	0
3441	this bumpy is wicked groovy .	0
3442	i thought it would be haggard but when i be gotted this junky i was mad happy and stuff .	0
3443	this junky is super duper rad. it be my fav c-phone and stuff .	0
3444	so go and buy dis sucka beefo it all be gone an stuffff .	0

3455	most of our emplyees use this model phone .	0

3457	while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones .	0
3458	after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends , i bought this nokia 6610 .	0
3459	and really this is the best phone one could have .	0
3460	it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .	0
3461	it is lightweight , sleek and attractive .	0
3462	this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .	0
3463	the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only .	0
3464	it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime .	0
3465	its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside .	0
3466	it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .	0
3467	only if we could get one camera in it . .	0
3468	it did have scored over all other competitors ....	0
3469	i am enjoying my phone a lot ....	0
3470	like some other reviewers , i recieved this phone using t-mobiles upgrade program .	0
3471	i had been comparing the 3650 , 3560 and the 3595 but could n't settle ... then along came the 6610 , which was perfect for me .	0
3472	small size .	0
3473	i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it .	0
3474	just make sure the keys are locked .	0
3475	color screen is good .	0
3476	it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar .	0
3477	the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .	0
3478	navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .	0
3479	battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so .	0
3480	not many .	0
3481	the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .	0
3482	pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?	0
3483	is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software ?	0
3484	first of all i have been a big nokia fan and have been upgrading my cell phones about once a year ( right after the release contract is over ) .	0
3485	my last phone was a samsung s105 which imo is superior and cheaper to this phone .	0
3486	below is how i evaulate this phone with other t-mobile phones which i have borrowed from parents / friends :	0
3487	sound quality :	0
3488	the most important thing for me is sound quality .	0
3489	nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .	0
3490	i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series .	0
3491	the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .	0
3492	overall design :	0
3493	i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets .	0
3494	of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest .	0
3495	the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small .	0
3496	as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a ) you wont scratch your screens / keys b ) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys .	0
3497	ease of use :	0
3498	how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu ?	0
3499	the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons ( like assign alarm clock to the left directional key ) .	0
3500	that is a very nice feature .	0
3501	the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones ( t610 , t720i ) .	0
3502	the sony ericsson phone ( t610 ) has the most whistles and bells , but is also the hardest to use .	0
3503	the nokia , samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do n't talk too much .	0
3504	the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day ( although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life ) .	0
3505	the t610 has the most functionality hands down .	0
3506	personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice .	0
3507	my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity .	0
3508	the t610 can also compose music , a feature which most wo n't use .	0
3509	the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .	0
3510	it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .	0
3511	the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can 't say much about the motorolla .	0
3512	all these phones have color screens , polymorphic tones , and are internet ready .	0
3513	in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones .	0
3514	regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop .	0
3515	i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft .	0
3516	oh well ..	0
3517	overall this is a slightly better than average phone .	0
3518	both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610 .	0
3519	personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more .	0
3520	i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year .	0
3521	if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 .	0
3522	they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling .	1
3523	this is the best phone i have seen .	0
3524	i bought 2 of these phones 2 months ago for myself and my girlfriend .	0
3525	we got a familyplan from t-mobile which saves us tons .	0
3526	the phones are awesome .	0
3527	we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .	0
3528	here 's a hint : go to nokia.com and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth .	1
3529	you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games .	0
3530	the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .	0
3531	i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .	0
3532	nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com	0
3533	i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had .	0
3534	the features are really cool like the radio .	0
3535	the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it .	0
3536	technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! !	0
3537	why i do n't can this product without a plan ?	0
3538	i 'm live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators .	0
3539	i 'm pay in auto-debit in my account .	0
3540	please , if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions , i 'm wait very happy .	0
3541	i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features , but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone .	0
3542	as i travel quite a lot , i 'd want something with gsm as well as cdma tri-band .	0
3543	for a specific location , i still think its a great phone .	0
3544	i think that it is a were good mobile phone and i may buy it .	0
3545	this really is a great little phone ; its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny !	0
3546	i waited a few years between phones , mostly because ( like most i think ) i didnt really need one .	0
3547	this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .	0
3548	the downside though , may be a big one for you .	0
3549	its quiet .	0
3550	really quiet .	0
3551	grandma in church quiet .	0
3552	i 've gotten used to it ( holding it in just the right realation to the ear , ducking into quieter places in bars ) but when others borrow it they 're shocked i can use it .	0
3553	so , i recomend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . )	1
3554	i bought this phone when it first came out in the summer .	0
3555	prior to my switch to t-mobile , sprint was my service provider .	0
3556	to say the least , i was horribly dissatisified with my service with sprint , which was why t-mobile was so fantastically refreshing .	0
3557	my past two phones were all flip phones , and i was beginning to tire of them .	0
3558	nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .	0
3559	first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .	0
3560	i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) .	0
3561	the phone is small , light , and very attractive .	0
3562	the battery life is amazing .	0
3563	the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .	0
3564	i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs .	0
3565	i highly recommend this phone to anyone .	1
3566	i 've yet to be dissappointed .	0
3567	nokia 6610 ( sound quality ) the phone is great with very cool features &#38; options , but comparing to my older motorola phone , it gets a failing grade in speaker quality .	0
3568	i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .	0
3569	it 's going back today , &#38; being replaced with the new samsung x105 .	0
3570	you do take your chances with this phone .	0
3571	i considered this phone ( nokia 6610 ) , mainly because of my sister and the features .	0
3572	it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features .	0
3573	truly , i am quite impressed . . ! !	0
3574	this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) .	0
3575	on an average , you would charge it once a week .	0
3576	the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .	0
3577	i simply love this feature .	0
3578	in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .	0
3579	the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .	0
3580	if you buy the stereo headset , you will enjoy it much more .	1
3581	the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .	0
3582	no more hazzles of keying in all data , using the small phone keypad .	0
3583	just maintain them ( phonebook , calendar and to-do list ) in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth .	0
3584	additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. )	0
3585	the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc. other nicities , that you would enjoy .	0
3586	the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .	0
3587	the built-in camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff .	0
3588	if you have a good digital camera , there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone .	0
3589	however , if you are keen , you can attach a camera to this phone .	0
3590	i have not yet discovered the internet features yet , which i will be doing soon .	0
3591	i felt that i should write this comment asap , as i am quite excited in using its features .	0
3592	i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime .	1
3593	after using the bulky 3650 for three weeks , i searched for a smaller alternative .	0
3594	i was immediately interested in the 6610 .	0
3595	i have used this phone for two months now .	0
3596	not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want .	0
3597	if you can live without an integrated camera , you wo n't miss much more .	0
3598	in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .	0
3599	the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent .	0
3600	even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio .	0
3601	if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are .	0
3602	although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing .	0
3603	the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .	0
3604	however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off .	0
3605	in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .	0
3606	it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone .	0
3607	one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .	0
3608	overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .	0
3609	any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages .	0
3610	nokia does not disappoint in this model .	0
3611	go for it !	0
3612	i could n't be happier with t-mobile either , i switched from cingular .	0
3613	one complaint ... the screen is too easily scratched !	0
3614	but there are faceplates to replace it i guess ...	0
3615	almost there .	0
3616	i got this phone in t-mobile 's current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal .	0
3617	i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089 , but was waiting for the right phone to come along .	0
3618	this is almost it but not quite but the price was right .	0
3619	that said this phone does what it does extremely well - way better than anything motorola can produce .	0
3620	it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .	0
3621	what it lacks for me is n't available on one phone yet , namely gsm850 ( also sometimes known as gsm800 ) , bluetooth and edge .	0
3622	so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again .	0
3623	but for now this will do .	0
3624	oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone , but its not shipping at time of writing and the tri-band gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam .	0
3625	great phone .. .	0
3626	great features .. .	0
3627	i purchased this phone after having been an at &#38; t subscriber with a nokia 8260 phone for over three years .	0
3628	i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .	0
3629	i went to an at &#38; t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads .	0
3630	they told me i would have to connect to my laptop , which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email .	0
3631	with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10 , i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet .	0
3632	i have had no problems with the phone .	0
3633	friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it .	0
3634	i 've even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive .	0
3635	great phone , i 'd buy another .	0
3636	excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .	0
3637	bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better .	0
3638	one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .	0
3639	overall an excellent phone .	0
3640	the service from t-mobile is very good too .	0
3641	in all a winning combination .	0
3642	worth every penny !	0
3643	great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !	0
3644	i purchased this phone for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it .	0
3645	nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .	0
3646	it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it .	0
3647	now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school !	0
3648	people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant .	0
3649	service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great .	0
3650	now i can always be in contact .	0
3651	this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .	1
3652	a great deal in general !	0
3653	i would not give up this phone for the world .	0
3654	1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone .	0
3655	yes , the features are numerous .	0
3656	the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .	0
3657	people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i 'm even using a speakerphone .	0
3658	the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .	0
3659	the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use .	0
3660	i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before .	0
3661	nokia has definitely won me over with this one .	0
3662	first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .	0
3663	the radio feature has superb sound quality .	0
3664	i 've compared this phone to others such as 6100 , siemens sl55 .	0
3665	even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them .	0
3666	it has a classic design yet looks hip .	0
3667	is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel .	0
3668	it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket .	0
3669	for those that are looking for camera phones just get the camera attachement and comes with the stereo headphones to listen to the radio in style .	1
3670	the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .	0
3671	one thing that i found out recently is that you do n't need t-zones from tmobile to go online .	0
3672	every t-mobile plan comes with gsm data , meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps ( with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference ) .	0
3673	anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net , being able to download pics and ringtones ( not java apps , you need t-zones for that ) .	0
3674	tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .	0
3675	if you thought about getting this phone buy it .	1
3676	this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .	0
3677	i currrently have service with t-mobile , verizon , and t-mobile .	0
3678	the reason so many is that i am a contractor and all of my subs have these carriers and i can benifit from the mobile to mobile features that companies are now offering !	0
3679	that beside you are prob. very well aware of many of the features that this phone is known for , and one that has not yet been mentioned : using this phone as a modem for any computer with a usb 1.0 port !	0
3680	using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account .	1
3681	yes it is 56k speed , but the functionality is what you are paying for .	0
3682	i myself find this great for when i am at a site i can run to my truck and hook up my modem cable ( 49.99 @ nokiausa.com or t-mobile.com ) press dial up on my laptop ( by the way it is a mac pb 1gz. and in a matter of seconds i can access my email , fax , and the entire web from my truck !	0
3683	the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls ( real estate broker software ) very well at all .	0
3684	i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t-mobile  hot-spots  .	0
3685	it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .	0
3686	as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it .	0
3687	do too many stuffs to get to a free phone after rebate .	0
3688	also , if i want a family plan , which mean i need tw phones on a plan .. .	0
3689	so how can i do that ... are n't that free for two after the rebates .	0
3690	and how can i do that ... .	0
3691	print those coupons twice for two phones ?	0
3692	i saw another review saying his only gripe was a lack of voice dialing .	0
3693	the phone does have voice dialing according to amazon & t-mobile and nokia .	0
3694	the phone may look large but it is very small smaller then the 3390 phone .	0
3695	my sister has this series of phone and she loves the radio and headset .	0
3696	i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .	0
3697	i do n't really like bounce .	0
3698	i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones .	0
3699	battery life is good for a phone of this size .	0
3700	but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .	0
3701	great screen and great sound .	0
3702	ok , everybody loves the fm radio in this , but you want a cell phone first , right ?	0
3703	the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god .	0
3704	the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) .	0
3705	the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive .	0
3706	my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .	0
3707	nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad , which imho is totally unnecessary .	0
3708	this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .	0
3709	( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . )	0
3710	other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .	0
3711	finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier .	0
3712	their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .	0
3713	if you can get this phone for cingular or at&t , go with the other carriers .	1
3714	the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .	0
3715	when i first saw the 6610 , i thought it was too small .	0
3716	after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .	0
3717	it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included .	0
3718	the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all , unless dialing a number .	0
3719	unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .	0
3720	when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .	0
3721	the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !	0
3722	the phone has several color schemes you can choose from .	0
3723	i like the default blue .	0
3724	you can also set a background wallpaper .	0
3725	the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?	0
3726	no more annoying series of beeps .	0
3727	this phone plays up to 4 tones at one time and it actually sounds like music .	0
3728	you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .	0
3729	the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .	0
3730	the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .	0
3731	the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful .	0
3732	you can get weather , movies , horoscopes and more with a few clicks .	0
3733	the service deafults to showing the information associated with your billing zip code , but you can change the default and seach other areas while on the go .	0
3734	one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .	0
3735	their website does not show it as a compatible phone , and should i try to access the game downloads on t-zones the system returns an error message saying my phone is not supported .	0
3736	i have been assured this will be fixed soon .	0
3737	now , for the t-mobile service :	0
3738	i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones .	0
3739	if you have a question , they have the answer .	0
3740	and should they not know it , they can find it out pretty quick .	0
3741	every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone .	0
3742	all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved .	0
3743	i 'd like to see my old carrier do that !	0
3744	the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .	0
3745	different people have different needs , of course , but the t-mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive .	0
3746	the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t-zones worked .	0
3747	this phone is highly recommended otherwise .	1
3748	nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .	0
3749	with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .	0
3750	the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .	0
3751	one of the things t-mobile brags about is the fact that it 's a  worldphone  and can be used in europe , etc.	0
3752	yet they 've gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone , including italian , german , and dutch .	0
3753	the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .	0
3754	therefore , if you wanted to travel abroad and pop in a local sim card , even if you unlock the phone , there is no way you can use the local wap browser or internet .	0
3755	after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another , i got fed up and have decided to return the phone .	0
3756	bottom line , if you 're attracted to this phone because of its tri-band feature so you can take it abroad , forget it .	1
3757	find another phone , or buy this one in its manufacturer-unlocked form .	1
3758	this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it .	0
3759	i purchased the phone last week and have been using till then . .	0
3760	i did n't had any problem till now .	0
3761	the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .	0
3762	it is very light weight and has a good signal strength .	0
3763	however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .	0
3764	it is not as good as the samsung phones that i have used earlier .	0
