__label__0 this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .
__label__0 i was surprised by t-mobile 's service .
__label__0 plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .
__label__0 8mb for a camera like this is a joke .
__label__0 for me on the fine resolution setting ( not maximum but very close ) this adds up to over 1000 images with the 1 gig card .
__label__0 after multilple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available .
__label__0 these problems were consistent , and also not present on another dvd player .
__label__0 what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .
__label__0 i love the storage in this thing .
__label__1 also , you can store data on it , which is a plus. for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n't bother , this is a much better buy .
__label__0 i always shoot using the lcd panel .
__label__0 i do n't use a bracket , i just hold it above my head and aim the flash with my left hand .
__label__0 this is a big plus for those who a shifting to digital and the g3 's large mobile screen helps with this .
__label__0 ease of use :
__label__0 i like the default blue .
__label__0 just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( alsmost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .
__label__0 i 'd like to start off saying that before this product i was using an archos jukebox recorder .. .
__label__0 the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line .
__label__0 playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists .
__label__0 the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive .
__label__0 i hoping they will then begin building quality dvd players again , as i do like them .
__label__0 this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong .
__label__0 update : the finish is more  mirror  than silver -- and i like it !
__label__0 canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .
__label__0 the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .
__label__0 transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1.1 or 2.0 .
__label__0 the other controls are all very easy to use .
__label__0 for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .
__label__0 the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .
__label__0 i 've registered this unit at www.apexdigialinc.com and listed the problem .
__label__0 the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset .
__label__0 extremely convenient .
__label__0 . go ; get a high speed like lexar 12x or higher cf card .
__label__0 overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera .
__label__0 the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie  extras  on them on the two occaisions when i tried to do that .
__label__0 typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others .
__label__0 i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .
__label__0 i am returning mine for a replacement , but if i receive another ad-2600 with the same or similar problems i will not only return it for a refund , but never buy another apex product in the future .
__label__0 one still works fine , the other quit after one day .
__label__0 prior to the purchase , none of my digital camera friends mentioned the delay between pressing the shutter button and the camera taking the picture .
__label__0 great camera .
__label__0 i think that it is a were good mobile phone and i may buy it .
__label__0 but with a low price , comes lower quality .
__label__0 i researched , held , tested , and observed 3 different brands .
__label__0 the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed .
__label__0 as soon as i lifted the unit out of the box , i questioned my judgement .
__label__0 it would have been better to have some sort of window on teh carrying case , so you could see the display without opening it .
__label__0 output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv .
__label__0 2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow .
__label__0 great features .. .
__label__0 3 ) 4x zoom is nice
__label__0 it wo n't play 80 % of my movies , which are all store boughten .
__label__1 the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .
__label__0 have tried calling ( 866-4apexgo ) , but can 't get through .
__label__0 the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest .
__label__0 i am not associated with the company , i am not providing a url , but search for notmad and you should find it pretty easily .
__label__0 the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .
__label__0 the ipod also does not let you see what 's coming up next on the player .
__label__0 i would suspect that there are similar problems with all of the other brands as this is somewhat new technology .
__label__0 its quiet .
__label__0 i 've been able to change modes on this thing without even looking at the manual .
__label__0 i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .
__label__1 my advice to mp3 buyers : consider how much storage space you will need , then try and listen before you buy -- mp3 players can only fully evaluated by holding and listening to them .
__label__0 depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .
__label__0 in that too , there is n't a direct way to add date ; time - you got to say ' print images ' to a different directory in which there is an option to specify the date ; time .
__label__1 if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera .
__label__0 it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . )
__label__0 -- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .
__label__0 ( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . )
__label__0 i just want to at least try an exchange but you can 't get through to their number , it 's always busy .
__label__0 the scroll bar is a bit of a pain .
__label__0 be forewarned .
__label__0 for me the sound of the music is what is important .
__label__1 my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com .
__label__0 the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .
__label__0 the samsung phones has a customize function so that you can assign certain functions to directional buttons ( like assign alarm clock to the left directional key ) .
__label__0 i myself find this great for when i am at a site i can run to my truck and hook up my modem cable ( 49.99 @ nokiausa.com or t-mobile.com ) press dial up on my laptop ( by the way it is a mac pb 1gz. and in a matter of seconds i can access my email , fax , and the entire web from my truck !
__label__0 the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .
__label__0 whereas some folks have the  ipod  , i have the  nomad jukebox zen xtra  ( not to be confused with the  nomad jukebox zen nx  ) .
__label__0 even better , ipod integrates perfectly with itunes so that managing music is a snap .
__label__0 1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .
__label__0 owner 's manual has substandard troubleshooting guide .
__label__0 my past two phones were all flip phones , and i was beginning to tire of them .
__label__0 the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .
__label__0 i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well .
__label__0 for the price and features it is really good .
__label__0 and i finally settled on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
__label__0 the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road !
__label__0 poor quality pics , short battery life , slow time consuming uploads and printing will ruin the digital camera experience and keep you buying film .
__label__0 just imagine if you place a bit of knowledge when you take your photos .
__label__0 all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product .
__label__0 i ignored the instruction booklet ( as i do with any product ) and figured out how to organize separate playlists within minutes .
__label__0 like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .
__label__0 i 've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered .
__label__0 1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .
__label__0 also , i downloaded the latest firmware upgrade and software updates .
__label__0 i give it 10 stars !
__label__0 unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks .
__label__0 does your apex dvd player only play dvd audio without video?
__label__0 usability ( button usage , feature selection , menu structure , display size and quality ) also has good feedback .
__label__0 4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )
__label__0 the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .
__label__0 in fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered .
__label__0 the camera comes with a lexar 16mb starter card , which stores about 10 images in fine mode at the highest resolution , i intend to buy a bigger card soon .
__label__0 for three months , i 've researched the internet and magazines , queried various sales personnel , and took hands-on in-store test drives .
__label__0 however , the battery life is good enough you should n't be overly concerned with turning this phone off .
__label__0 it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do .
__label__0 but heck it plays my alias dvds .
__label__0 although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing .
__label__1 this is not the unit you should use if you go jogging anyway .
__label__0 i wanted a decent sized camera with a contour for my fingers to hold it steadily .
__label__0 everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction .
__label__0 its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .
__label__0 i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .
__label__0 i 'll have to borrow cd 's to rip from friends to even come close to filling the thing .
__label__0 after receiving my zen xtra 40gb mp3 player .. .
__label__0 flash card memory vs. hard drive ( i.e. why does a 256 mb player cost $$$...and a 40 gb ( 40,000 mb ) player only cost
__label__0 transfering is easy , the software makes everythig pretty easy .
__label__0 on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd .
__label__0 you can also delete songs from the player itself , and create playlists - on the fly - on your player .
__label__0 it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman .
__label__0 the phone comes with okay ringtones , some decent backgrounds / screensavers , but the phone has very little memory ( mine had 230kb as it arrived from amazon , so you do n't have too many options on what you can put on there ) .
__label__0 - included creative software is pretty poor .
__label__0 finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best .
__label__0 the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .
__label__0 did i mention i 've already dropped it once ?
__label__0 it always pays off .
__label__0 bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature ... but not on this player .. .
__label__0 i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes !
__label__0 the pro ...
__label__0 the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks .
__label__0 some of my friends had well branded dvd-players but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks !
__label__1 if you plan to carry the device around ( it is a mobile device , right ? ) then this is something you might want to think about .
__label__0 i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no visable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) .
__label__0 i purchased two apex 2600 for christmas presents .
__label__0 after messing with it at a store i noticed how bad the i-pod was .
__label__0 i am quite happy with the camera .
__label__0 i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year .
__label__0 the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective )
__label__0 when talking the voice is not very clear .
__label__0 and then you will start to belive them .
__label__0 the cd just has too many problems with win xp .
__label__0 depending on all the above requirements , i had narrowed down my search to nikon 4300 and canon powershot s400 models .
__label__0 i 've had the player for about a month now .
__label__0 if you watch one dvd per weekm its yours .
__label__0 what can i say , i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever , quality design , stable , plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies .
__label__0 connecting the same outputs to a video card in my computer , there was sound but still no picture .
__label__0 as of this writing , technology has not solved the focus-lock lag time problem for point-and-shoot digicams and anyone who is satisfied with it simply has never used a modern film slr .
__label__0 the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .
__label__0 the g3 has a shoe which will take other powerful ( and expensive ) canon flashes that will allow bounce and reflected flash photography .
__label__0 2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called  unknown .
__label__0 8 battery life is excellent .
__label__0 have tried to contact apex via e-mail ( customerservice@apexdigital.com ) , but the e-mail address is not valid .
__label__0 within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob .
__label__0 mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs .
__label__0 having said that , this is what you do .  add to cart  !
__label__0 they decide that the owner was responsible for the damage and so even if it is returned within the warranty period , creative will charge you to fix it .
__label__0 much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate
__label__0 4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worthwile at the price .
__label__0 it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .
__label__0 and with the panoramic  stitch  mode , it guides you through stitching together multiple pictures to build a seamless panoramic image .
__label__0 they piggy-back on cingular 's service .
__label__0 it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .
__label__1 press the p/n button located on the bottom right corner of the remote .
__label__0 the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid .
__label__0 it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system .
__label__0 only one disk played through to completion successfully .
__label__0 you would then have a phone number in that country and not have to pay for international roaming in that country .
__label__0 even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out .
__label__0 it has a classic design yet looks hip .
__label__0 * main dial is not backlit .
__label__0 my friend has an i-pod for about 2 years and the battery has so so messed up .
__label__0 i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .
__label__0 finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier .
__label__0 12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) !
__label__0 3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing .
__label__0 - not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it .
__label__0 i just told them , press halfway , wait for the box to turn green and press the rest of the way .
__label__0 prior to my switch to t-mobile , sprint was my service provider .
__label__0 nokia seems on a campaign to revamp the phone keypad , which imho is totally unnecessary .
__label__0 i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set .
__label__0 what a big improvement ... lol ) and the fact that lots of people have had problems with ipods on windows computers , i realized this is a much better buy .
__label__0 i treat the battery well and it has lasted .
__label__0 i should have looked at it harder .
__label__0 the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .
__label__0 he spent another half hour on the phone with tech support , to no avail .
__label__0 i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .
__label__0 it also does n't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! !
__label__0 can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go .
__label__0 finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me !
__label__0 i 've even had one friend buy one immediately after a test drive .
__label__0 cheaper to produce , holds a lot , heavier and has moving parts which means it 's a little more prone to damage from being banged around .
__label__0 in any other mode it autofocuses continuously and burns batteries .
__label__0 i forgot , the case does n't fit .
__label__0 the features are really cool like the radio .
__label__0 it overrides songs so you have to go in there and put it your own titles especially if you have remixes .
__label__0 short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) .
__label__0 it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included .
__label__0 the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd .
__label__0 bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent .
__label__0 in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders .
__label__1 i do recommend getting the data kit for those geeks .
__label__0 all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
__label__0 this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon. never knew i could love a digital camera so much .
__label__0 i think the ipod versus zen typifies differences between apple and win machines .
__label__0 if you do n't have a gray card , you can use a plain white piece of paper .
__label__0 size - bigger than the ipod
__label__0 the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out !
__label__0 i bought this player during a christmas sale at an excellent price .
__label__0 since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .
__label__0 each of the 4 lasted less than six months .
__label__0 mp3 players have either flash card memory or a hard drive in them .
__label__0 i had apex regular ( non-progressive ) dvd-player for two years .
__label__0 comes with standard rca jacks for output , along with s-video output ( s-video cable not included , must be purchased seperately ) and also component video outputs .
__label__0 software - music match jukebox is n't the greatest , the search funtion is n't fast even when accessing it with the hotkey shortcut .
__label__0 a digital camera will stay at home if its a hassle to use .
__label__0 for a specific location , i still think its a great phone .
__label__0 nothing has broken on it , and it plays all the dvds i have .
__label__0 i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy .
__label__0 i will not be ordering another one to replace it .
__label__0 this phone is a winner ...
__label__0 i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective .
__label__1 if you thought about getting this phone buy it .
__label__0 there were a few flaws that i learned to deal with and took thousands of pictures around the world , losing a few that i really regretted .
__label__0 all rechargeable batteries lose their holding power over time ( around 2 years ) .
__label__0 rather heavy for point and shoot but a great camera for semi pros .
__label__0 like the zen , the karma does not support folders and is not designed to be a data storage device .
__label__0 unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd .
__label__0 and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod .
__label__0 i looked up the ipod , the dell jukebox , and the samsung napster player .
__label__0 i can only confirm what other customers have said - crap !
__label__1 but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera .
__label__0 that is where my satisfaction ends .
__label__0 the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can 't say much about the motorolla .
__label__0 then again a one time use camera may do just as well .
__label__0 i accually did n't buy the apex ad-2600 from amazon but , the reviews i found here helped me purchase it .
__label__0 structurally , everything is secure and it wo n't fall apart on you .
__label__0 for once , though , this 3rd party software is excellent .
__label__0 the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .
__label__0 -- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .
__label__0 the regular mode in this camera works for 80 % of settings .
__label__0 i 'd have given it 5 stars , but i 'm waiting to see if this one holds up to more frequent use than the last one :
__label__0 i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response .
__label__0 having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .
__label__1 i definately recommend a large memory card .
__label__0 it has never worked .
__label__0 the technology is finally here folks , to make your photo life easier .
__label__0 if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions , i 'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk .
__label__0 there are n't many reviews for the iriver ihp .
__label__0 i finally returned the unit to the company along with copies of my messages and return info .
__label__1 if you decide to go to another country for an extended period of time , you can just buy a sim card from a service provider in that country .
__label__0 my first impression was positive .
__label__0 it was either the 40gb ipod or this one .
__label__0 lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .
__label__0 i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 .
__label__1 the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead .
__label__0 the phone is small , light , and very attractive .
__label__0 unlike the ipod , this is fully windows compatible and can be used right out of the box .
__label__0 since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work  in 24 hours  .
__label__0 it may have taken several years to fill this up .
__label__0 in the hands of someone who does n't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode .
__label__0 while it is true that it will stand on end , it is also easy to knock over that way .
__label__0 its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake .
__label__0 the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling .
__label__1 3 ) use files with id3 tags - not a problem if your cds were ripped within the last year .
__label__0 want the laundry list of reasons why ?
__label__0 the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name .
__label__0 got way too many blurry pictures .
__label__0 the controls definately took some getting used to .
__label__0 their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .
__label__0 the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .
__label__1 i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .
__label__0 it also costs a lot less than the ipod .
__label__0 and how can i do that ... .
__label__0 the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --
__label__0 however , using the lcd seems to eliminate this minor problem .
__label__1 any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor , along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support .
__label__0 redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more !
__label__0 what a junk .
__label__0 forget talking on it in public -- you just can 't hear the other person !
__label__0 it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
__label__0 the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . )
__label__0 they fall in love with the product .
__label__0 the other reviewers have clearly pointed all the good things about this camera , which i do agree .
__label__0 the less computer-saavy might find apple 's software a bit friendlier , though ( i use it at a friend 's house and it does do a lot more for you . )
__label__0 although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent .
__label__0 case - the nomad comes with a leather holding case .
__label__0 it seems like movement , even small movement , causes skipping in playback and even the device freezing .
__label__0 the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n't wash my car .
__label__0 i have uploaded about 3,000 songs now with very minimal difficulty . ( it 's fast too ! )
__label__0 the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful .
__label__0 i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it .
__label__0 the zen does n't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; even with third party software that  creates  folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best .
__label__0 the i/p button switches the tv display between interlace and progressive .
__label__0 there are a lot of cool websites with games and midi ringtones to download for free .
__label__0 on my relatively new computer ( p4 with windows xp and usb 2.0 ) , the os complained about the installation of the drivers .
__label__0 seriously ! i love it !
__label__0 i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .
__label__0 no more hazzles of keying in all data , using the small phone keypad .
__label__0 i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .
__label__0 the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .
__label__0 i 'm pay in auto-debit in my account .
__label__0 the light goes from red to green but no display or any operation whatsoever .
__label__0 if it had the same number of  ?  s then it would ask if you want to overwrite another song that just had the same number of  ?  s. . .
__label__0 best electronic i 've bought since i was born .
__label__0 stayed up all night trying to figure out that thing .
__label__0 i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it .
__label__0 but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on ithave a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments .
__label__0 neither message was answered ( they ask for 24 hours before replying - i 've been waiting 27 days . )
__label__0 i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38; t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .
__label__0 it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod , and has a longer battery life .
__label__0 it 's a very intuitive program .
__label__0 now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk .
__label__0 it was worth a shot -- too bad it did n't work out .
__label__0 from what i 've heard it 's at least equal .
__label__0 it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .
__label__0 they look fantastic .
__label__0 it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .
__label__0 while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones .
__label__1 2 ) buy a good pair of head-phones unless you already own one .
__label__0 i love the quality of the pictures .
__label__0 it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it .
__label__0 my girlfriend is paranoid when i am not around her and i just take a pic and send it to her on the spot so she can regain her sanity .
__label__0 i purchased it for it 's easy ability to accept cd-r hacks .
__label__0 i purchased it at a retail store , and got an extended warranty .
__label__0 the price is way below an ipod of the same size .
__label__0 i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked .
__label__0 one of the things t-mobile brags about is the fact that it 's a  worldphone  and can be used in europe , etc.
__label__0 i have n't figured it out yet .
__label__0 the ipod is a neat piece of machinery but after screwing around with both of them i think the zen products are the way to go .
__label__0 the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .
__label__0 i 've compared this phone to others such as 6100 , siemens sl55 .
__label__0 4 . and , of course , i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had n't used it much .
__label__0 but for now this will do .
__label__0 longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities .
__label__0 i guess you get what you pay for .
__label__0 it 's easy .
__label__0 let me quote a customer service rep from one of the authorized apex service locations in my state ( they only service apex tv 's , not dvd players ) :
__label__0 it plays alternate video formats ( vcds , svcds , cvds ) very well .
__label__0 once again , the sound is awesome , the batterly life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life .
__label__0 the distortion is not a flaw .
__label__0 other than that this thing is great ...
__label__0 i should n't have been cheap , should have bought a toshiba .
__label__0 the battery is nice .
__label__0 the  scene  mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a  regular  setting .
__label__0 we also looked at the fuji fps602 .
__label__0 that makes sense though , with all the substandard products they make .
__label__0 a few of my work constituants owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .
__label__0 the dynamic playlists (  now playing  , i belive creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate .. .
__label__0 i used a canon powershot s20 for about 2.5 years and loved it !
__label__0 to save a picture as raw , you have to have the display on , this seems like a waste of battery power .
__label__0 again , you can change this , but it 's harder to spot a minor variation in the title when you do n't have the title of the other disk in front of you .
__label__0 i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for repaing the damned thing .
__label__0 one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) .
__label__0 there are no other aftermarket cases available for this model yet , so you have to live with it .
__label__0 player controls :
__label__0 since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment , aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make .
__label__0 the zen has no stop button .
__label__1 thank you very much , and go out and get yourself a nomad !
__label__0 i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy .
__label__0 hope this review has helped you in making up your mind .
__label__0 basically u can see that i have given the player 3 stars , instead of 1 .
__label__0 i received this as a gift for christmas .
__label__0 this is almost it but not quite but the price was right .
__label__1 the sound is excellent , but a tip : get a real pair of headphones .
__label__0 i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before .
__label__0 it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice .
__label__0 i was immediately interested in the 6610 .
__label__0 grandma in church quiet .
__label__0 first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .
__label__0 clearly a large lawsuit if i were so inclined .
__label__0 unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted .
__label__0 it only took me about 10 seconds to transfer a 200mb file .
__label__0 on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .
__label__1 if you 're investing in a camera at this level , buy this software !
__label__0 as it is , i 'm keeping the machine .
__label__0 so you can plug your nomad directly into your stereo or use a car adapter , but you do n't get the quality from a true line out jack .
__label__0 based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots .
__label__1 this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .
__label__0 what the heck is up with the 2600 .
__label__0 i 'm sending this pup back to amazon and looking for the 2500 on ebay .
__label__0 they said it is in stock , but they are  too busy  .
__label__0 they got the best lens adapter for the g3-better than canon 's .
__label__0 you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .
__label__0 and man ... i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player ... because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title ..
__label__0 in a quick summation , here is what i found .
__label__0 i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but onfull size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .
__label__0 it happened to me once .
__label__0 i love it ! !
__label__0 if it does , ill give up .
__label__0 also bought a soundblaster card that they sold for the mac .
__label__0 one thing , before buying this player i have called the creative tech. support and asked them if i can navigate by folders beside artist / album and answer was yes .
__label__0 when we tried to hook up the first one , it was broken - the motor would not eject discs or close the door .
__label__0 then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all .
__label__0 friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased .
__label__0 reviews of apple 's support are generally poor ; they seem to address issues in warranty , which covers a short time after delivery / pickup of item .
__label__0 9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .
__label__0 simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use .
__label__0 the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
__label__0 one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough .
__label__0 it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .
__label__0 the moment passes , and then your new g3 camera takes the shot .
__label__0 a 10 gb ipod is just as much and i have heard from multiple sources that the ipod is very loud and you can heard the hard drive everytime it spins , accesses files or does antyhing .
__label__0 the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better .
__label__0 i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up .
__label__0 both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice .
__label__0 i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had .
__label__0 and you get about 120 images on a 256mb card at highest quality .
__label__0 it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ?
__label__0 great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like .
__label__0 i shopped around for a month looking for a good mp3 player , and all i heard was how good the i-pod was .
__label__0 not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want .
__label__0 the ad-1600 did n't work corectly from the start and the ad-1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up .
__label__0 i have n't figured out if this is the case for all the songs on itunes .
__label__0 i purchased the ad2600 after feeling comfortable with the reviews i read here on amazon .
__label__0 i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine .
__label__0 anyway , on with the review .
__label__1 many reviewers refer to it as  clunky  or  difficult  - heed their warnings .
__label__0 i did have some problems figuring out how to turn the unit on , but creative did a good job with this , as they had a clearly labled  on  button that i found when i left my cellar for the first time in years .
__label__0 well i decided to get this one .
__label__0 the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .
__label__0 overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .
__label__0 i did n't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out .
__label__0 yes it is 56k speed , but the functionality is what you are paying for .
__label__0 3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws .
__label__0 autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all .
__label__0 it is crystal clear .
__label__0 this is all i have to say .
__label__0 the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n't blind you when you stare too long .
__label__0 those who have had the nomad for a few weeks are mostly thrilled with it .
__label__0 5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .
__label__0 it lasted about 1 1/2 weeks .
__label__0 i didnt wait to experiment .
__label__0 the reviews of this product can be roughly divided into two groups : ( 1 ) those who have had the product for a few weeks and ( 2 ) those have had the product for a few months .
__label__0 i bought this camera because it fit my budget and the pre-production and production model reviews were positive .
__label__1 save them on computer and print out just the ones who want .
__label__0 so when it breaks , as it will , you will find yourself very disappointed and depressed at the loss of the nomad .
__label__0 i bought this to replace an expensive ( $ 300 + ) onkyo dvd player that quit after only 3 years !
__label__0 here were my requirements in a digital camera :
__label__0 besides the one problem , this machine is amazing !
__label__0 frequent signal searches eat up battery power .
__label__0 now i need to buy myself another one !
__label__1 go for it ...
__label__0 further , the xtra doubles the maximum filecount capacity to 16000 mp3 .
__label__0 its great .
__label__0 the general button placement is not very user friendly .
__label__0 there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours !
__label__0 it focuses in a snap .
__label__1 as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away !
__label__0 i leave the adapter and uv filter on all the time .
__label__0 this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .
__label__0 thanks for nothing , amazon !
__label__0 is this how nokia subsidizes their free pc software ?
__label__0 first of all , many actions that the player utilizes do n't make sense . .
__label__0 therefore , if you wanted to travel abroad and pop in a local sim card , even if you unlock the phone , there is no way you can use the local wap browser or internet .
__label__0 i just got screwed out of fifty bucks .
__label__0 i purchased this unit 3 months back and i think the unit knew when my warrenty expires .
__label__0 but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n't anticipate any problems with it .
__label__0 there was neither picture nor sound .
__label__0 i did a little research on the web and this is the player i decided on .
__label__0 weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] .
__label__0 - the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n't .
__label__0 you can create playlists , drag & drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player .
__label__0 luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can 't .
__label__0 being a great fan of the g2 i set out with g3 with a somewhat negative expectation , difficult as it is to improve drastically on something already as ' perfect ' as the powershot g2 .
__label__0 i got one of these to serve as a second dvd player in my house .
__label__0 i tried to play the song three times , with no success .
__label__0 the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use .
__label__0 you can take pictures with the camera held above your head , way down , or beside you with no problem , allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself .
__label__0 just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .
__label__1 if you buy the stereo headset , you will enjoy it much more .
__label__0 progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) .
__label__1 so buy the g3 .
__label__0 you need the storage to hold a decent amount of shots at 4 megapixel resolution .
__label__0 the ipod 's white plastic look / surface does n't suit me .
__label__0 this thing seriously is a good player though .
__label__0 it will read and play all cd audio disc .
__label__0 it does have a digital zoom on top of the optical zoom , but you sacrifice quality .
__label__0 its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket .
__label__0 my wife shuns all new technology and compained when i brought this home , but now she 's forever asking for the digital camera .
__label__0 i was trying to decide whether or not i should go with the 40 gb ipod or this 30 gb zen xtra .
__label__0 with the nomad explorer software , songs should be drag-and-drop .
__label__0 and so far , i 've been very pleased .
__label__0 had i not been in such a hurry to load cds , i would have spotted them sooner .
__label__0 it is some protection for the unit , but for useability , forget it .
__label__0 size and weight :
__label__0 it suppose to play everything .
__label__0 ( i would have appreciated having a firewire plug , however )
__label__0 what the hell is wrong with this thing .
__label__0 it practically plays almost everything you give it .
__label__0 you can use the scene modes , or fine tune the options , i. you can change the iso level , shutter speed , etc.
__label__0 it also stores data so i can see myself placing some data files on here .
__label__0 this is ridiculous .
__label__0 recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .
__label__0 i just transfered over some 40 cds and have plenty of space left for me .
__label__0 you will find it very hard or impossible to get you money back .
__label__0 this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .
__label__0 but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it !
__label__0 it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .
__label__0 the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .
__label__0 still , apple continues to squeeze dollars from consumers by not designing the battery to be replaceable .
__label__0 the software will convert your cd 's to mp3 and put them on the player as well as your hard disk if you want it to .
__label__0 3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip .
__label__0 sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .
__label__0 reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
__label__0 there 's no so-called background hiss that i 've noticed , at least so far .
__label__0 i currently own an olympus d-550 which takes wonderful outdoor pictures .
__label__0 the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .
__label__0 i can 't connect it to my computer though , but that 's a problem with windows me , not the camera .
__label__0 recently , i attended a  flyball  competition
__label__1 it can be a point-and-shoot camera , but if you do not intend to  get into  it 's finer features , i 'd suggest a less enthusiast featured choice .
__label__0 i used it lightly , and it lasted just over one year ( forgot to kill the power one day , and now it only plays dvds ).
__label__0 my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) .
__label__0 the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .
__label__0 simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .
__label__0 i have to rip everything as a 160 kbps wma file ( as opposed to 128 kbps mp3 ) to avoid hearing digital garbling .
__label__0 i got weird messages about it not being ok 'd by microsoft ( or something like that ) , then i thought it failed to load , then it loaded .
__label__0 it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .
__label__0 i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed .
__label__0 the one i purchased for a frend as a gift will not read any dvd disc .
__label__0 . this camera keeps on autofocussing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped .
__label__0 now heres the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equilizer type deals on here .
__label__0 the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .
__label__0 creative labs customer support website is useless .
__label__0 whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio .
__label__0 the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it .
__label__0 this provides added protection for the camera lens and allows the use of filters .
__label__0 it goes nicely with my apex 27  in my bedroom .
__label__0 made the camera totally inoperable .
__label__0 i bought a 256 mb cf and a second battery , so it 's good to go on a long vacation .
__label__0 as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it .
__label__0 i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .
__label__0 it sends discoutinous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment .
__label__0 they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thusfar ) .
__label__0 ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .
__label__0 to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder .
__label__0 these are the reasons i think it 's great :
__label__0 i will never buy another apex digital product !
__label__0 all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera .
__label__0 the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .
__label__0 i got my zen xtra a little bit more then a week ago .
__label__0 if t-mobile does not offer such a phone most likely i will get the t610 .
__label__1 if you are out for an mp3 player with a lot of memory and do not want to spend a ton of money , i think this is a great purchase and strongly recommend it .
__label__0 but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there .
__label__0 i had been comparing the 3650 , 3560 and the 3595 but could n't settle ... then along came the 6610 , which was perfect for me .
__label__0 working for 10 hours with it on  shuffle  totally rocks ! !
__label__0 despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box !
__label__0 photos had some artifacts and noise .
__label__0 these things may get a lot better in the future , but from what i 've seen in the last few years , the technology for digital cameras is n't advancing at the pace of pc 's , phones and hard drives .
__label__0 because once the moment is gone , it is not coming back .
__label__0 looking at the glowing reviews from people that have had this for a week or two , i kind of wish people would wait until they 've had a product a little while to review it .
__label__0 i have taken about 150 photographs so far and have absolutely loved the experience .
__label__0 also , they 'd forgotten to add  wap  capability to my service ( duh ) , so that took another 4-5 days of figuring out .
__label__0 the moveable lcd screen is great .
__label__0 when i first saw the 6610 , i thought it was too small .
__label__0 if this is your fist dvd player .
__label__0 i do n't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags .
__label__1 whichever camera you buy , add upto about 200 dollars for an additional memory card i bought a 256 mb card , usb card reader , camera bag and the warranty .
__label__0 there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board .
__label__1 so , it 's a good idea to purchase an extra battery to insure that you are not left hanging .
__label__0 the first one would n't work from the start .
__label__0 we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work  apex  dvd players and none worked .
__label__0 unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds. even though they were not damaged in any way .
__label__0 3 . that 's pretty much all the negatives the positive things truly outnumber the negatives , and the negatives are n't that bad .
__label__0 however , if anyone has participated in violent or extreme sports while using their zen , please share your experiences .
__label__0 so now i keep it in my pocket .
__label__0 the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me .
__label__0 * protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window .
__label__0 with 40gb of storage i have about 7,500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2,500 more .
__label__0 like i said , when the moment is gone , it is gone .
__label__0 very bad quality .
__label__0 this is not a handbag camera .
__label__0 as i travel quite a lot , i 'd want something with gsm as well as cdma tri-band .
__label__0 i cant use my nikon external flash on a canon camera , but i can use my metz , with the proper metz module and extension cord connected between the g3 and the 60 ct-4 .
__label__0 this camera has significantly more noise at iso 100 than the nikon 4500 .
__label__0 f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the asthetics bit down , of course
__label__0 you can get weather , movies , horoscopes and more with a few clicks .
__label__0 i got it now , and i 'm diggin ' it .
__label__0 one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .
__label__0 overall , a good buy for the price .
__label__0 from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .
__label__0 if you have any doubts about this player , well do n't .
__label__0 tech support could n't figure it out and gave up .
__label__0 in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1. for some sizing information ) .
__label__0 but it works perfectly fine on my parent 's computer .
__label__0 it is connected to an old television set via composite video and analog audio outputs .
__label__0 a great deal in general !
__label__0 there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .
__label__0 this is a great investment for someone like me who enjoys music and hates carrying multiple cds .
__label__0 though we were past the deadline for returns ( by a few days ) , i contacted amazon right away and pleaded for help .
__label__0 * slick-looking design and improved interface
__label__0 at the same time i purchased this camera i also bought adobe 's photoshop elments 2.0 software , and can 't praise it highly enough .
__label__0 a dock is unnecessary as the charger and usb cable do the necessary .
__label__0 a tons of reveiws has reported this problem and the same here .
__label__1 the bottom line : if you 're serious about your digital photography , or been bitten with the bug after using a digital point-and-shoot , this may be just the camera for you .
__label__0 do too many stuffs to get to a free phone after rebate .
__label__0 they would n't repair my camera unless if i pay $ 100 for parts ? and labor !
__label__0 i was a little concerned to be the black sheep buying this player instead of the incredibly overpriced apple i-pod .
__label__0 keeps coming up with no disk errors .
__label__0 the storage capacity is great for me --
__label__0 the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .
__label__0 i have done a lot of research before i decided to buy the nomad zen xtra .
__label__0 sometimes you skip past things or have to press it twice to select items .
__label__1 do n't buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card .
__label__0 if i wasnt a runner i would take a bullet in the foot for my nomad jukebox .
__label__0 even at the  normal  setting , a 8x10 print ! shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a  digital  .
__label__0 got it for christmas , still learning a few of the settings , but i do n't take pictures every single day .
__label__0 red chair 's notmad explorer is great & recommended by about every reviewer to repleace the creative jukebox software .
__label__0 i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal .
__label__0 now i can always be in contact .
__label__0 worse of all , they claim that it 's some kind of internal damage and refuse to cover the cost via warranty !
__label__0 i own another canon - an eos ( 35mm film ) camera .
__label__0 it only took about 30 minutes to download everything , and that was about 950 songs .
__label__0 i am a soldier serving in baghdad right now .
__label__0 i can do that myself .
__label__0 once i actually got to an answering machine and left a message .
__label__0 the nomad is only sligtly larger than an ipod .
__label__1 if you want to listen to tunes while you travel , i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books .
__label__0 this is nothing new , every mp3 player , memory card , etc. , used for digital media today has some kind of preloaded operating software on it .
__label__0 to discover this i had to read about 10 online reviews ( with many complaints about the lack of stop button ) before i found one reviewer who was smart enough to both figure it out & document it .
__label__0 only the cheap and poor would buy one .
__label__1 here 's a hint : go to nokia.com and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth .
__label__0 i 'm one of those people that can only concentrate on one screen at a time so i 've been having trouble paying attention to the little display panel on top , but that does n't stop me from loving this camera .
__label__0 i am going to have to try an online download and see if that works .
__label__0 overall i like the unit .
__label__0 you can also create your own if you do n't like their classifications .
__label__0 i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds .
__label__0 for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .
__label__1 so , if you read the instructions well , you should n't have any problems with this dvd unit .
__label__0 sure , i adjusted the film speed to 400 .
__label__1 can 't complain and i recommend it over all the other players , just hope that remote will come out soon .
__label__0 so if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen os you can 't use nomad until you get home .
__label__0 its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n't sinc with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , ect. like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) .
__label__0 left it set on my desk came back five minutes later and it just wanted to keep playing the same song over and over .
__label__0 6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's .
__label__0 you have to manually take the cap off in order to use it .
__label__0 8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
__label__0 this is the third apex dvd i bought .
__label__0 the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes !
__label__0 creative software stinks .
__label__0 that meant even less light and just as much action .
__label__0 this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .
__label__0 after i took their picture with their camera , they offered to take a picture of us .
__label__0 it helps avoid the problem of a color cast on the pictures , especially in mixed-light settings .
__label__0 i have several tv shows on dvd so they are divided by episode .
__label__0 but that 's not an insurmoutable obstacle .
__label__0 i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !
__label__0 the headphone jack seems to be a major problem .
__label__1 synchronizing music among computers , if you have more than one , seems to be an issue ; research this before buying if you have multiple computers you want to be synchronized .
__label__0 now it would have gotten 5 stars had this baby come with features to upgrade the firmware and was able to play divx or avi videos .
__label__0 replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 .
__label__0 i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias .
__label__1 so all you do is stick a pin or something small in the reset button & you 're golden .
__label__0 the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .
__label__0 second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed .
__label__0 advertising pays off i guess .. .
__label__0 i 've had an assortment of cell phones over the years ( motorola , sony ericsson , nokia etc. ) and in my opinion , nokia has the best menus and promps hands down .
__label__0 i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service .
__label__0 the results are shadow-free images that look as if theyve been exposed with the gentlest natural light you could imagine .
__label__0 so .. .
__label__0 what it lacks for me is n't available on one phone yet , namely gsm850 ( also sometimes known as gsm800 ) , bluetooth and edge .
__label__0 prior to christmas , it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad !
__label__0 rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . .
__label__0 none of these are perfect .
__label__0 i am very pleased with the apex ad2600.it plays just about anything you put in the drawer .
__label__0 i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .
__label__0 bought the apex ad-2600 from amazon in 12/03 mainly on price , $ 49.99 - $ 10 rebate = $ 39.99 .
__label__0 the value , name , and resolution signed the lease .
__label__0 after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck .
__label__0 thats it .
__label__0 not good if you 're taking this traveling .
__label__0 so far the player froze on me once ( i started pushing buttons before it loaded ) but since is hard drive based - you have to expect that .
__label__0 reading the reviews , it looks as though people really love this device for a month or two and then come to hate it .
__label__0 as mentioned above i broke the player within the 1st 10 days .
__label__0 following my research , i decided on the g3 .
__label__0 the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy .
__label__0 creative is talking about updating it via firmware , however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players , looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates , not too much of new features .
__label__0 carry your entire collection !
__label__0 i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers .
__label__1 i repeat - do n't waste your money .
__label__0 this explains why you see what appears to be such weird pricing on mp3 players .
__label__0 almost half what an ipod would cost you !
__label__0 the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption .
__label__0 i have a dvd burner .
__label__0 i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it !
__label__0 i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .
__label__0 i was a little disappointed in the low end .
__label__0 i quickly discovered that the nomad was n't going to work for me .
__label__0 i have n't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box .
__label__0 and while it is cool and fun and has no film processing costs .
__label__0 i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .
__label__0 any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort .
__label__0 this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .
__label__0 pros summary :
__label__0 it 's a shame , but mine is going back .
__label__0 they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department .
__label__0 . even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image
__label__0 i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) .
__label__0 the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .
__label__0 value : comparing data storage with price .
__label__0 i 've been using a powershot s330 for nearly a year , and wanted to upgrade to a 4 or 5 megapixel camera with a longer zoom , more adjustability , a hot shoe for an external flash , and a remote control .
__label__0 that is a major minus , but its not that bad .
__label__0 i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality .
__label__0 when i turned eax back on the static was also not present .
__label__0 after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it .
__label__0 if you 're intrested in buying a spare battery it 'll run you another $ 50 , a little steep i thought .
__label__0 you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of  now playing  interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .
__label__0 if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod , creative zen , rio karma and iriver ihp - you 'll notice that each has their pros and cons ; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later .
__label__0 i intend to contact the company , but from what i 've read .
__label__0 dim or bright , it would never take a picture after the birthday candles had blown out , after the tae kwon do kick broke the board .
__label__0 1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more .
__label__0 i have not been disappointed with my purchase .
__label__1 yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them .
__label__0 that way i could get rid of a walkman alltogether .
__label__0 i would n't gotten this dvd based on the reviews i read after christmas .
__label__0 this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks .
__label__0 there 's a dent on the upper-back-right and lower-back-right corners ... not too obvious unless you 're up close .
__label__0 this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas .
__label__0 at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice .
__label__0 maybe more competitors will bring out similar products .
__label__0 uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .
__label__1 the way to fix this is to rename the track by adding a number yourself to the end of the track listing .
__label__0 getting the printer to help output them was another tale .
__label__0 bought one for $ 49.99 .
__label__0 very large pics take 8mb each !
__label__0 there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize .
__label__0 i can routinely talk on the phone in my house in the suburbs , which is an unaccustomed luxury , even with t-mobile service .
__label__0 it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .
__label__0 i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy .
__label__0 2 ) storage capacity
__label__0 i 've figured out most of its features on my own already ( because i have used digital cameras before , so i know things like symbols ) .
__label__0 reason for two ?
__label__0 i purchased the apex 2600 after reading good reviews of it , both here and in other places .
__label__0 the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .
__label__0 they refunded my $ $ $ so fast and paid for the shipping back .
__label__0 i am very pleased with it so far .
__label__0 there is n't need to get in details again , but just remember it rocks because : price , sound , ease of use , and features .
__label__0 - the software that came with it was tough to load .
__label__0 personally i like the samsung phones better because i found myself liking the flip phones so much more .
__label__0 you could have paid more and got a lot less .
__label__0 i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason .
__label__0 however , i do n't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n't secure and the case can slip off .
__label__0 the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .
__label__0 fiance did n't like the feel .
__label__0 just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc.
__label__0 it was just a problem with the player .
__label__0 we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working .
__label__0 oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy .
__label__0 this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .
__label__0 simply configure the mediasource software ( or windows media player , or your ripper-du-jour ) to create file names that include artist and ( especially ) album names in addition to track names .
__label__0 great feature list , poor reliability .
__label__0 within months they stopped supporting the new mac os .
__label__0 when the player was working it was great ,but .
__label__0 the ipod costs more for the same amount of memory .
__label__0 the button on the remote to switch from pal to ntsc was undoubtedly my problem .
__label__0 when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 .
__label__0 buy this camera and savour it .
__label__0 i bought coolpix 4300 two months after i had bought canon powershot s400 .
__label__0 many people recommended the ipod , and i borrowed one from a friend .
__label__0 2 ) the remote works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong .
__label__0 you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right .
__label__0 i can hand this to anyone and know they will take some great photos !
__label__0 the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
__label__0 1 . pictures wo n't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable .
__label__0 you can 't simply open up a folder from the player and play all the songs in it .
__label__0 what a disappointment .
__label__0 loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well .
__label__0 one horrible flaw , or mayybe more than one .
__label__0 nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .
__label__0 my wife and i read and read and read reviews on different cameras for months .
__label__0 when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good !
__label__0 it has 2 games .
__label__0 overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .
__label__1 if you are planning to buy that player , do not !
__label__0 the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods .
__label__0 * software is absolutely terrible :
__label__0 my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27  screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17  monitor .
__label__0 it makes the dvd player to switch between interlace mode and progressive scan mode .
__label__0 for example , i tried playing my new  pirates of the carribean  extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it .
__label__0 + they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures .
__label__0 this camera has a major design flaw .
__label__0 . the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that .
__label__1 unless your a professional , now you will need only one camera . this one .
__label__0 i would have given this thing 4.5 stars but since i can 't , i 'll be sweet and give it the full 5 stars .
__label__0 it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .
__label__0 i knew nothing about dvds before this but with this machine i figured it all out very quickly .
__label__0 like others have mentioned , you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they 're on lower bit levels .
__label__0 i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down.now buy it !
__label__0 thank you !
__label__0 i am crossing my finger and wish they will fix the problem .
__label__0 in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .
__label__0 if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly .
__label__0 if you have two tracks with exactly the same name on one disk , it will not copy both -- it gives you the option of skipping the second or overwriting the first with the second .
__label__0 the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n't be easier to use .
__label__0 its really cool .
__label__0 that does n't leave me with a good feeling about its future stability .
__label__1 ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras .
__label__0 at my heaviest usage , i must recharge after 3 days .
__label__0 i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work .
__label__0 i have 100 of my cd 's transferred and have n't made a dent in the 30 gb drive .
__label__0 it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .
__label__0 easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll / pushbutton .
__label__0 well in the beginning i was asking around for mp3 players .
__label__0 the service deafults to showing the information associated with your billing zip code , but you can change the default and seach other areas while on the go .
__label__0 i like the automatic key lock function .
__label__0 many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .
__label__0 basic shipping was a bit slow , but that 's okay .
__label__0 zennx 's capacity / price ratio on the 30g model ( $ 10/gig ) ) trumps ipod 's 30g model ( $ 14/gig ).
__label__0 ( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format .
__label__0 i 'll have to see if this becomes a problem down the road .
__label__0 personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors .
__label__0 new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays .
__label__0 i am still trying to resolve the problem with the second one .
__label__0 i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the  rigor  of a business traveler .
__label__0 the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .
__label__0 ( i 'm starting to think that this may just be one of the weaknesses of all digital photography at this level . )
__label__1 but make sure to buy a tripod and separate flash unit at the same time : you 'll see the difference in your photos immediately .
__label__0 the biggest drawback that people have about the zen xtra is the software .
__label__0 i 've yet to be dissappointed .
__label__1 if you 're a jogger and you want to strap it to your arm , i 'd recommend flash memory .
__label__0 it is very light weight and has a good signal strength .
__label__0 7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook .
__label__0 i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard .
__label__0 otherwise , you 'll have to mess around a lot with filenames inside the ( decent ) nomad explorer , which is not fun at all .
__label__0 1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days )
__label__0 my suggestion is to wait to see how the market develops .
__label__0 is my unit defective ?
__label__0 it comes with a 16mb flash card that you will need to upgrade !
__label__0 however , it has failed to deliver on quality .
__label__0 the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .
__label__0 + / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweakings with settings to try to make it great .
__label__0 you need the software to actually transfer files
__label__0 5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .
__label__0 i did have ability to charge it every night , so do n't know how long it would have actually gone before dying .
__label__0 i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .
__label__0 i probably would have liked to have a player in something other than silver / metallic ... like the battery adapters on their usb thumbdrive ( muvo nx ) mp3 player models .
__label__0 i tried re-setting it , i tried just about every pair of headphones in my house ( 10 pairs ) , and nothing worked .
__label__0 this is definitely opening up possibilities to obtaining mp3 's in which i would have never purchased the cd .
__label__0 and we all know about the rush to market on new products .
__label__0 after reading several other reviews this appears to be relatively common .
__label__0 i 'll state up front that i do not own a zen xtra and have not used one at all .
__label__0 1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone .
__label__0 i currently have ~ 1100 songs encoded mostly at 196 kpbs and i have n't even used 10gb of storage yet .
__label__0 it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .
__label__0 i wanted something that is able to take high quality photos but not be so bulky that i would wind up leaving it at home all the time .
__label__0 after using it for a few weeks ( the amount of time before the hard drive crashed ) it revealed a few of its shortcommings .
__label__0 all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukeboxed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .
__label__1 i would recommend a larger compact-flash card , at least 128 mb .
__label__0 when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house , that one didn  t work either !
__label__0 the camera was a marvel .
__label__0 otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward .
__label__0 only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon .
__label__0 they play just about everything , but # 2 and # 3 died very shortly after getting them .
__label__0 great phone , i 'd buy another .
__label__0 oh well ..
__label__0 i think the sound quality of this phone is slightly better than my samsung phone , the motorolla t720 series , and the sony ericsson t610 series .
__label__0 possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .
__label__0 i 've tried several dvd 's and even new ones do the same thing .
__label__0 2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .
__label__0 i think it fell right on the earphone plug when it fell ( murphy strikes again ) .
__label__0 great design and looks cool .
__label__0 ( batteries last longer too ! )
__label__0 the player kept displaying  no disc  , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ # * !
__label__0 one major complaint :
__label__0 i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .
__label__0 this is the best phone i have seen .
__label__0 a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture .
__label__0 yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .
__label__0 my story is based on personal usage .
__label__0 however , i do n't know the dvd 's performance on a heavy load of every-day viewing .
__label__0 i think the reson for the creative being larger is for sound dampening and protection , whihc is a plus , but then again it is only speculation .
__label__0 no-one mentions whether there is a stop button , but the photos do n't show one .
__label__1 please go to read dpreview.com and you 'll get the complete story .
__label__0 i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .
__label__1 try to buy a high capacity ultra card , as it 's 2x as faster as the regular cf card .
__label__0 3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything .
__label__0 on planes i use a splitter so two headphones can be plugged in for two people and the sound is equally good .
__label__0 2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )
__label__0 after looking over multiple large mp3 players , i decided to get this one .
__label__0 even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .
__label__0 so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly .
__label__0 the software you get with this camera is perfect .
__label__0 otherwise , be smart , save the cash .
__label__0 many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me .
__label__0 but because a few fine men and women took the time to create the upstanding rockbox software , the archos became a top notch player for me with intuitive features out the wazoo .. .
__label__0 there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .
__label__0 so i requested and received a zen xtra as a christmas gift .
__label__0 i have a 120 gb remote drive i use to store my digital images :
__label__0 using this method , i have not once encountered a situation where a track was rejected , and i have plenty of duplicate tracks on live and compilation albums .
__label__0 i am even a bit technology oriented , so i thought it would be a breeze to set this up .
__label__0 you can sort your music by artist , title , album , or genre , and you can play music based on those categories .
__label__1 so consider what you 're going to use the device for .
__label__0 the visceral teases include the case , the sound quality , and the capacity .
__label__0 the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to .
__label__0 below is how i evaulate this phone with other t-mobile phones which i have borrowed from parents / friends :
__label__0 you discover this later when you 're listening to a song and it 's the wrong title , causing you to rename everything on your own .
__label__1 be advised , however , that you may encounter problems .
__label__0 anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception .
__label__0 i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .
__label__0 the only thing i do n't like about this is the cover does suck .
__label__0 the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .
__label__0 4 ) a set of speakers and a wireless transmitter are accessories that will add to your player 's usability ( the latter will allow you to play it on your car radio , home receiver , etc. )
__label__0 this might happen if you get too close to the subject and you are not bounce-flashing , or if you are bounce flashing and the walls are simply too far away .
__label__0 the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's  notmad  software because of some advanced features i wanted .
__label__0 controls are a bit awkward .
__label__0 perhaps the weirdest was one of bruce springsteen 's cds from the tracks set being classified as goth rock .
__label__0 i love photography .
__label__0 it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .
__label__0 i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
__label__0 it 's been so long since i 've had a program not shut down on me in windows that i hardly even noticed that it happened .
__label__0 for instance , i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ) and it plays the dvds .
__label__0 the pros and cons of it :
__label__0 instead , i bought the adobe photoshop camera raw plug-in .
__label__0 when i first purchased the unit i downloaded the firmware update that was available on their website .
__label__0 sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization .
__label__0 highly recommended !
__label__0 1 ) frame freezes and the family yells ,  dad ! somethings wrong with the dvd player ! come quick !
__label__0 song transfers were not an issue .
__label__0 that 's a rare and valuable feature .
__label__0 i spent much time debating on whether i should go with the zen xtra or the ipod .
__label__0 one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .
__label__0 anyway , im gon na go find dennis now , have a nice day ! ! !
__label__0 2 . the scroll button is n't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select .
__label__0 its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus.
__label__0 after i went through the transer issue , i returned the zen xtra and purchased the 40 gig ipod .
__label__0 definetely a great camera .
__label__0 range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .
__label__0 lastly , the price is fantastic :
__label__0 it would have been a much easier choice if this were 5mp camera .
__label__0 there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n't moving in time to the dialogue ) .
__label__0 i agree with previous posts that you get what you pay for .
__label__0 - the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .
__label__0 also , the lens cap design is flawed .
__label__0 the nokia , samsung and the sony phones can all last for 3 days provided you do n't talk too much .
__label__0 scroll bar :
__label__0 well that is not true .
__label__0 if you cant get great pics from this camera its because you havent read the manual .
__label__0 nokia has definitely won me over with this one .
__label__0 the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .
__label__0 we tried the  finding nemo  dvd and when we got to ~ chapter 28 , the frames started to freeze for no reason .
__label__0 i can 't speak to its long-term reliability , as i 've only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point .
__label__0 navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .
__label__0 if the music had been on my home computer , the transfer would have been accomplished very quickly .
__label__0 through the software you can classify songs in genres .
__label__1 battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargebles , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have .
__label__0 however for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much .
__label__0 that 's what i did and hopes this helps .
__label__1 if that is for you then pay the money , learn from the experience and you 'll be a more informed buyer when you buy device # 2 .
__label__0 both creative and third-party powered speakers work great , as do third-party wireless transmitters .
__label__0 door broke after a month .
__label__1 you can change any of these , but need to be paying attention when the information is downloaded before you copy it .
__label__0 sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task .
__label__0 maybe it 's good for tvs with not so good color settings , but not good for my tv that already has very vibrant pictures .
__label__0 the nikon 's are great cameras .
__label__0 i 've been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v = finally decided that now was the time .
__label__0 i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times .
__label__0 creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n't as easy as i would have liked .
__label__0 deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ).
__label__0 consider it for a future gift too !
__label__0 the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size .
__label__0 it is versatile and seems to be one of the best .
__label__0 i 'm not sure why people have problems with either the interface of the nomad , or the software that comes with the unit .
__label__0 the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; see below ) .
__label__0 i 'm not sure  . ) .
__label__0 ( i guess only time will tell ? )
__label__0 not many .
__label__0 the quick sync is n't any good becuase it either needs to be configured properly or just is n't very useful .
__label__1 bottom line , if you 're attracted to this phone because of its tri-band feature so you can take it abroad , forget it .
__label__0 a 64mb flash card camera comes with a 16mb holds 52 pictures on  normal  resolution .
__label__1 whatever you do , do n't buy this product .
__label__0 6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .
__label__0 with progressive scan , i expect it to play play play - and give my old pioneer a rest .
__label__0 i bought the player this week and i like it by far .
__label__0 short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel .
__label__0 my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them .
__label__0 my 2.6 mhz pentium 4 with usb 2.0 was able to perform the task pretty quickly ( i would estimate ~ 5 - 8 minutes per cd ).
__label__0 in all a winning combination .
__label__0 the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight .
__label__0 with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .
__label__0 after playing with this little device , i do n't know why i would look at an ipod with the same space when it costs $ 500 and i got mine for a little more than half that price !
__label__0 the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity .
__label__0 i shopped around for a while before buying a hard-drive mp3 player .
__label__0 the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sais , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings .
__label__0 do n't get me wrong , the thing was like heaven for about a week .
__label__0 what kind of a company does that !
__label__0 the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .
__label__0 now i use ms mediaplayer , musicmatch ( free downladed ) , and  explorer / my computer / grab files from disk c or d into the player  to replace the mediasource .
__label__0 in terms of the important accessories , i got myself an the extra litium battery .
__label__0 this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks .. .
__label__0 navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .
__label__0 i liked this one enough to buy another .
__label__1 i do want to mention too that it is certainly worthwhile to read the instruction manual that comes with the unit .
__label__0 i replaced it with this not-quite-so-dazzling , but definitely more functional device .
__label__0 i am still trying to figure out the may options it has .
__label__0 the fm radio is cool .
__label__0 i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .
__label__0 hopefully the replacement from amazon will work just fine .
__label__0 i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work !
__label__0 i ordered two of these puppies for christmas gifts .
__label__0 it was impossible to do so before .
__label__0 what kind of product goes out within a month ?
__label__0 is it a coincidence that i no longer can get any of your nomad zen xtras ( worst name ever ) at best buy and now the 60gb nomad xtra is  sold out  or more likely  discontinued  at the almighty amazon.com ?
__label__0 i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 .
__label__0 no one told me , but i wanted to tell you .
__label__1 read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! !
__label__0 d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on
__label__0 navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well .
__label__0 truly , i am quite impressed . . ! !
__label__0 it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error .
__label__0 when the previous versions of the zens were shipped with musicmatch , people had this problem because musicmatch creates both sets of tags , which seem to confuse the zen xtra .
__label__0 i currrently have service with t-mobile , verizon , and t-mobile .
__label__0 this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .
__label__0 when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .
__label__0 focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .
__label__0 of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents .
__label__0 first there 's the unit itself .
__label__0 the setup and transfer process was cake for me .
__label__0 i purchased this player last week .
__label__0 furher it contains a card reader , a flash card folder for up to 8 cards , a lense cleaning rag , and an ac adapter , which is very helpful when working in an  outlet environment  .
__label__0 i am surprised amazon still carries this after all of the continued problems .
__label__1 btw , be sure to have your mp3 tags labled correctly , as this will ensure a great organization .
__label__1 or better yet , buy from another company that stands behind their products with a 12-month warranty .
__label__0 the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash .
__label__0 that 's why you have these things that can be keychain size .
__label__0 navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .
__label__0 i experimented with installing mediasource on 2 other computers at home and it worked fine .
__label__0 i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast .
__label__0 everyone who says i can 't buy the ipod because after excessive use in a short time ( the man who made the ipod battery life video admitted that he had used it extensively every day and charged fully every night for those 18 months , conditions under which any rechargeable battery dies .
__label__0 this provides drag & drop transfers of music between the computer & zen ; each time it transfers music to the zen it asks if you want to generate a playlist ; it allows playlists developed in other software to be transferred to the zen ( .
__label__0 no issues as of yet
__label__0 the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact .
__label__0 at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod .
__label__0 still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !
__label__0 either way , can 't go wrong with this price .
__label__0 4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed .
__label__0 ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier .
__label__0 and it holds sooooo much music and audio files .
__label__0 canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .
__label__0 i guess you get what you pay for .
__label__0 comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .
__label__0 i have been watching the development of digicams for years , waiting to make my first move .
__label__0 3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust .
__label__0 within 5 minutes i was able to transfer files .
__label__0 some may complain that there 's no drag-and-drop capability , but what they should realize is that this is mainly a portable music player , not a computer accessory or hard drive .
__label__0 started ripping and transferring .
__label__0 the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par .
__label__0 1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectis s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contructed mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )
__label__0 one more thing about indoor shots - many of the reviews knocked this camera for low light focusing .
__label__0 great quality picture and features .
__label__0 the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .
__label__0 now , i thought it 's time to upgrade .
__label__1 find another phone , or buy this one in its manufacturer-unlocked form .
__label__0 i bought the apex ad-2600 because of the ability to play jpegs and it seemed like it was the most bang for the buck .
__label__1 an extra for a back-up battery would be a good investment .
__label__0 unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .
__label__0 there should have been a recall on this product .
__label__0 the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .
__label__0 so it is probably  just bad luck  on my part that the personal notebook i own had this install error .
__label__0 still no response .
__label__0 amazon.com promptly refunded my money for the first one , because a replacement was not available ( thanks amazon.com !
__label__1 update : january 27th 2004 - the second one crapped out only after a week - dont buy this product !
__label__0 one minor complaint :
__label__1 so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a harddrive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .
__label__0 i figured with a great first product and with this one having more features than the 600 i would buy one .
__label__0 for the price it is a well spent investment !
__label__0 who cares if it does n't have multiple slots ?
__label__0 one of the calls was on a saturday and when i pressed the guy a bit , he said ,  actually we do n't ship on saturdays  .
__label__0 6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .
__label__1 i would recomend that you purchase a lexar media cf for the camera as the sandisk card that comes packaged is too small and too slow !
__label__1 if you want a quality mp3 player , splurge on an ipod .
__label__0 take the time to fill in those tags !
__label__0 so when the quad bands start appearing i will be upgrading again .
__label__0 forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds.
__label__0 almost there .
__label__0 the bottom line , i 'll still watch the progress of iriver hdd players and if they produce 40 gb player i 'll will sell my nomad and buy iriver .
__label__0 i should point out that the new rio karma is now down to about $ 280 and is reviewed readily as being as good as ( and better in some areas ) the ipod .
__label__0 it is extremely light and dissapears in your pocket .
__label__0 after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all .
__label__0 amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping .
__label__0 i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57,000 mb of free memory available to me .
__label__0 yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power .
__label__0 we got a familyplan from t-mobile which saves us tons .
__label__1 if you have the appetite choose the one that you think has the least deficiencies or is best suited to you .
__label__0 i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :
__label__0 also , you need to have the headset plugged in all the time to have the radio work and that can get tedious .
__label__0 i did everything i could , and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader .
__label__0 not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem .
__label__0 unfortunatly it was dropped and damaged a year after i bought it .
__label__0 the included memory card is too small .
__label__0 basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n't used .
__label__0 i got every song i had downloaded to the player within a day or so .
__label__0 i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose .
__label__0 i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .
__label__0 but the earbuds suck !
__label__0 but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .
__label__0 i had all my files already on my pc in wma format ( 200 cd 's ).
__label__0 it is made of plastic .
__label__0 after reading all the glowing review on this camera , i went to my local camera shop to try one .
__label__0 i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .
__label__0 the lcd screen was very large and readable .
__label__0 the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand .
__label__0 i made an additional five attempts at creating a playlist , before packing the unit up and heading over to amazon 's product return page .
__label__0 what made this product so great to me was the open source os called rockbox .. .
__label__0 however , it does n't register instantly as a hard drive like other players .
__label__0 newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .
__label__0 the title says it all ...
__label__0 one highly beneficial feature of this phone ( at least to me ) is that it can be used anywhere in the world except a few countries that do not use gsm , a few in asia .
__label__0 the bottom line :
__label__0 you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .
__label__1 then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored .
__label__1 always remember , cameras do n't take great pictures , people do !
__label__0 but there are faceplates to replace it i guess ...
__label__0 in my case , the bill was $ 81 , about a third of what i paid for it .
__label__0 i was n't sure how long it would take before it would break .
__label__0 i would not give up this phone for the world .
__label__0 even if i had paid full price i would have considered this a good deal .
__label__0 overall it is the best camera on the market .
__label__0 the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt .
__label__0 the motorolla phone have a horrible battery which lasts about a day ( although i heard that the motorolla t722i has a much longer battery life ) .
__label__0 pc cable is too expensive ... $ 50 for a usb cable ?
__label__1 they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling .
__label__0 i hope my next player doesnt breakdown . .
__label__0 if no problems occur with replacement unit i will keep the 4 star rating .
__label__0 it can get pretty lonely out there .
__label__0 now i have not owned other mp3 players as i was waiting until they matured , but since i received it as a gift i now have this one .
__label__0 as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .
__label__0 they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality .
__label__0 the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warrranty period is to expire .
__label__0 the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive .
__label__0 one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .
__label__0 am i ever glad that i decided on this camera !
__label__0 you can 't find the mpeg playback on high priced units .
__label__0 crappy headphones .
__label__0 my last mp3 player 's screen drove me nuts .
__label__0 the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try .
__label__0 speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .
__label__0 i have n't quite figured this one out yet , but it is probably operator error .
__label__0 i like the speakphone function a lot .
__label__0 at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast !
__label__0 vibration was not even listed as a feature when i purchased this .
__label__0 the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display .
__label__0 despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc. .
__label__0 this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .
__label__0 my brother bought an ipod this past summer and my dad bought the original zen around the same time ..
__label__0 i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .
__label__0 i have not yet tried the photo show capability , but i 'm thinking that will probably work well too , based on the success with the above mentioned disks .
__label__0 able to use service in another country :
__label__0 first of all , let 's start with my needs : 1 $ 500 budget 2 4mp resolution , 3 optical clarity and color , 4 fast - very little shutter lag and quick sep-up for next picture , 5 compact size , and 6 good camera grip to minimize camera shake .
__label__0 great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .
__label__1 buy an extra battery - life is good but still somewhat short .
__label__0 it was marked up increadably high compared to other models ( almost $ 500 for a 30gb ) , and theres was nothing about it that made it worth that much money .
__label__0 i bought this last week through amazon .
__label__0 the software failed repeatedly .
__label__0 there was very little light in there .
__label__0 really quiet .
__label__0 is eax faulty ?
__label__0 nokia was my first nonflip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .
__label__0 the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .
__label__0 this is not the same thing as a film camera .
__label__0 it was too new to have learned much about the advanced features , so i generally used the auto mode .
__label__0 the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .
__label__0 the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .
__label__0 given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .
__label__0 one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent .
__label__0 it has a nice color screen .
__label__0 this thing does its job .
__label__0 i got this player for christmas & this was my first time using an mp3 player .
__label__0 these models now ship with creative 's mediasource program , which allows you to highlight the files on your computer that you want to add to your zen xtra , click a button , and transfer it straight to your player .
__label__0 this thing lasted well over 14 hours when i played it straight for the first time .
__label__0 however , i should have followed my instincts :
__label__0 i downloaded the trial version , and after less than 10 minutes of using it , decided it was well worth the price .
__label__0 i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor .
__label__0 the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative .
__label__0 it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches .
__label__0 picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .
__label__0 it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .
__label__0 no way to contact their customer service .
__label__0 i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .
__label__0 it also covers over the power jack when closed .
__label__0 the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating .
__label__0 the karma does have a stop button .
__label__0 in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .
__label__0 it is not as good as the samsung phones that i have used earlier .
__label__0 i bought this dvd player mainly because my old sharp dvd player could not play most of the dvds from the store that i rent from and i had to watch them using my pc 's dvd-rom player .
__label__0 i received this dvd player free with the purchase of a palm tungsten e from officemax .
__label__0 that was n't pretty .
__label__0 when i turned eax off the static disappeared .
__label__0 compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck .
__label__0 now i can transport files to friends house with ease .
__label__0 so how can i do that ... are n't that free for two after the rebates .
__label__0 2 . i did not want a very small camera as it seems to get lost in my hands and i was n't comfortable with that .
__label__0 this would have been much easier .
__label__0 it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .
__label__0 which means that in trying to save a few hundred dollars , i 'll end up spending more than twice that .
__label__1 you have to install the software to the computer you 're transferring to , instead of just connecting it with a usb connection .
__label__0 the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool .
__label__0 i called creative and they said to send it in and they would decide if it in warranty .
__label__0 the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .
__label__0 a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be .
__label__0 i recently bought the nomad jukebox zen xtra , and did n't even get as far as charging the battery .
__label__0 the second problem is solved by more direct lighting from the metz ( with the attendant shadows unfortunately ) .
__label__0 i am an amateur photographer and here is a piece of advise to all the folks who are thinking about making a move the digital world .
__label__0 this is possible ! !
__label__0 great camera , great investment !
__label__0 also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and vbr mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) .
__label__0 the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use .
__label__0 i reviewed several digital cameras before settling on this one .
__label__0 this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player .
__label__1 get the canon 850 printer and an ex flash .
__label__0 i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .
__label__1 you do n't need the extra resolution or the cost .
__label__0 great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !
__label__0 well worth the money .
__label__0 the price / performance looked just right .
__label__0 what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .
__label__0 the massive phonebook can hold 300 entries , with multiple phone number per entry , so you can program your boss 's home , work and cellphone numbers all under one contact .
__label__0 it is a good camera in terms of the function and quality , but take your chance with it because nikon absolutely sucks when it comes to customer service .
__label__0 you can stop playback by pressing 2 buttons , first the pause button , then the  next track  or  previous track  button .
__label__0 this is quite simply the best you can ask for .
__label__0 little inconveinent , but unlike other players i only paid 40 $ .
__label__0 actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated .
__label__0 i got an rma from creative , sent my player in to them for repairs .
__label__0 i 've picked up a few accessories that i found to be useful .
__label__1 if your view in life is that you are going to pay $ x00 to get a device then it must be near ideal - ruggedly constructed , fault proof , good product support , easy to use software - then do yourself a favor and do n't buy yet .
__label__0 have had problems since the first day
__label__0 the devices competing with the ipod are the iriver ihp 120 , the rio karma , and the philips hdd100 .
__label__0 the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )
__label__1 only problem , if you think it 's going to be delivered in the 24hrs amazon claims , do n't hold your breath .
__label__0 this is a powerful piece of equipment .
__label__0 you can also set a background wallpaper .
__label__0 honestly , the best players without any flaws were the goddam cd players .
__label__0 it hasnt gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ).
__label__0 it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds .
__label__0 the sound quality is also nice ... after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with .
__label__0 sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod .
__label__0 i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed !
__label__0 i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera !
__label__0 i love the eos based controls and easy menus .
__label__0 it is n't big and offensive , though you would n't know it by looking at the pics it takes .
__label__0 it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files .
__label__0 the battery life seems good , takes very lttle time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs .
__label__0 i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it .
__label__0 all the buttons & neccessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .
__label__0 umm , well , thanks for nothing .
__label__0 i got this dvd player as a gift and had to send it back .
__label__0 i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision .
__label__0 in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer 's remorse .
__label__0 i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement .
__label__0 the software is great .
__label__0 after using it for just a month , i could not play any dvd .
__label__0 it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot .
__label__0 i can 't simply bring up my entire list of songs , click play , and then hit next .
__label__0 messing around with images in photoshop ( a supplied software package ) and printing them on a good printer , yielded excellent results .
__label__0 you can get a pretty good progressive scan sony or toshiba now for 68 bucks just about anywhere .
__label__0 getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .
__label__0 the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .
__label__0 for an early christmas gift , i got a zen xtra 40 gb player .
__label__0 also , the instruction manual is very bad .
__label__0 people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .
__label__0 zen good points :
__label__0 i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. .
__label__0 the more i work with it , the more i love it !
__label__0 i followed their advice but that failed , too .
__label__0 in general it is easy to use and well laid out .
__label__0 after much survey of all the present handsets and recommendations from friends , i bought this nokia 6610 .
__label__0 i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy .
__label__0 i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed .
__label__0 10 great price for all the features .
__label__0 the player itself has all sorts of problems .
__label__1 save yourself some aggrivation .
__label__1 or save time and just do it , you wo n't regret it .
__label__0 here are the pros and cons ( few there are ) in detail :
__label__0 the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent .
__label__0 the lense is a lot better , and the 4mb produce fantastic pictures .
__label__0 the phone has several color schemes you can choose from .
__label__0 the ear-piece has a button that answers and hangs-up the phone so you do not have to mess with the phone at all , unless dialing a number .
__label__0 saved me from having to buy an expensive optical cable , as i already had a coax cable .
__label__0 i just bought notmad manager ( $ 25 ) and file transfers are easy drag and drop , songs stored by id3 tags not by folders , needs to have software on computer to transfer files , no window on case ( nice case otherwise .
__label__0 however , the creative software is not real intuitive .
__label__0 it is a beast .
__label__0 so what ?
__label__0 the camera is a dream to operate in automode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .
__label__0 had this been my only dvd player , though , it would have been a real problem .
__label__0 i've owned 6 or 7 dvd players since 1998 .
__label__0 i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife .
__label__0 the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .
__label__0 or does it play audio and video but scrolling in black and white ?
__label__0 sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening !
__label__0 i set the camera to the  manual  mode for one main reason :
__label__0 really happy with this little camera .
__label__0 everything else about the camera is great .
__label__0 2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic .
__label__0 that way i could keep it in the case all the time .
__label__0 next time i set it at 100 and used the flash .
__label__0 * does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ).
__label__0 output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold .
__label__1 read the directions !
__label__0 - no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .
__label__0 i believe this is enabled by a second file that comes out of the camera that stores all this information .
__label__0 we use older versions 880 , 885 of this model in the office and i find them to produce excellent quality photos .
__label__0 the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel
__label__0 that takes up half the space of mp3 's .
__label__0 the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software .
__label__0 anyway , the initial impression is much better than when i opened the box on the 1100 over a year ago - you can telll that apex is trying harder to improve their product .
__label__0 i 've had the camera for about two weeks and shot hundreds of pictures so far .
__label__0 the light auto-correction is awesome .
__label__0 those that have it like it .
__label__0 it worked good for a while .
__label__0 assuming you have filled in all the id3 tags on your mp3s , you will not have any problem finding them on your zen xtra .
__label__0 the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance .
__label__0 yes , the features are numerous .
__label__0 e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage
__label__0 i bought the zen xtra 30g as a gift .
__label__0 have had the player since xmass and love it !
__label__0 amazon has been working with me to refund my money , but they reminded me that i have past the 30 day return policy and this was a courtesy return .
__label__0 not sure , if customer rep. did not know the product exactly , it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear .
__label__0 although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product .
__label__0 one broke , one got stolen , and then i bought the riovolt sp - 350 .
__label__0 great phone .. .
__label__0 even if there happened to be identical track titles on the same disc , you could still edit the file name manually and get them both onto the player .
__label__0 1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .
__label__0 tmobiles might not have the best reception in some areas but with amazing phones such as nokia 6610 and cheap plans that you get way more minutes than any other plans .
__label__0 however , the convenience of using digital far outweighs the slightly less accurate indoor pictures .
__label__0 you have to ask yourself ,  how much money is dissapointment worth ?
__label__0 however , the creative lab did come out new update to fix their software problems .
__label__0 i can 't believe people continue to pay those prices .
__label__0 you 're talking totally different hardware .
__label__0 ps : ( mediasource provides similar functions with ms mediaplay such like cd ripping , tagging , music database managing , music file transfering , and more )
__label__0 yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy .
__label__0 well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze .
__label__0 it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .
__label__0 the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .
__label__0 i called apex 's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing .
__label__0 feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products .
__label__0 the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .
__label__0 the compact flash is delicate and i hate to swap it in fear on the connetions ( camera and cf ) bending ( can lead to cf erros ) or losing it .
__label__0 i can of course buy such a tool off the shelves separately but helps if it comes with my camera .
__label__0 i am still trying to resolve it four months later .
__label__0 updating the unit 's firmware :
__label__0 b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display
__label__0 i doubt i will use half of the storage capacity , but you never know .
__label__0 the phone would have received 5 stars if the phone had voice dialing and the game downloads from t-zones worked .
__label__0 this did not give me enough control .
__label__0 my first player ( model ad-500a ) went into the trash about 6 months after i bought it .
__label__1 so , i recomend it , but not for those that have any hearing troubles , or for those that like to talk a lot in crowded public places ( which is annoying , by the way . )
__label__0 could not stop it , could not get out of the  now playing  screen .
__label__0 by the way my alias dvds are legit too not no bootleg from the internet .
__label__0 it took them twice as long to get to my unit as they said .
__label__0 - no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking
__label__0 you can also slow a song down & speed it up , which is cool too .
__label__0 a remote would have been cool too ... but lets not push it .
__label__0 while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .
__label__1 anyone looking for more than  point and shoot  can make a huge step up for a moderate price difference .
__label__0 with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ;
__label__0 i spent a lot of time comparing different cameras , and i realized that there is not such thing as the best digital camera .
__label__1 when it arrives , you press the shutter release .
__label__0 the 20 gig ipod still goes for just under $ 400 .
__label__0 games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .
__label__0 6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice .
__label__0 software - the software is crap .
__label__1 if you have windows me you should upgrade to xp anyway , lol .
__label__0 this is unnecessary with id3 tags but people who like to organize their music in folders will not like the zen as the audio files do not allow subfolders but rely on id3 tags .
__label__0 it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich .
__label__0 some movies it played yesterday , it wo n't play today .
__label__0 i am enjoying my phone a lot ....
__label__0 this is by no means unique to this model , i 'm sure .
__label__0 it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .
__label__0 some dvd 's i rented would not play .
__label__0 the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god .
__label__0 the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .
__label__0 i have no buyers remorse with this baby , and i never will .
__label__0 it is light enough to carry around all day without bother .
__label__0 i 've called the service number and if it 's not busy , it rings forever then eventually dumps you .
__label__0 so far the software for the pc works easily .
__label__0 the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n't figure out a way to break it .
__label__0 the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .
__label__0 fm receiver - it has none .
__label__0 before i  get used to it  , here are my first feelings :
__label__0 when i first had it i kept finding myself having to look at the nomad to figure out where the skip button was .
__label__0 the storage capacity is great .
__label__0 now as others said , so far this player is an awesome player , there are flaws .
__label__0 my only significant complaint is sound quality .
__label__0 so far , however , i 'm a very happy customer .
__label__0 otherwise , this player is awesome !
__label__0 eg 60 $ for a plastic box to hold 4 aaa batteries to increase the use time past 6-8 hrs ( reviewers figures )
__label__0 you can read the other reviews for specs and performance opinions .
__label__0 i purchased the ad 2600 from another company last month and was very satisfied with my purchase , until last night .
__label__0 and most stores will not take back a product 90 days after purchase .
__label__0 5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
__label__0 features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names .
__label__0 this camera will stay with me for years !
__label__0 zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .
__label__0 simple to use and hook up .
__label__0 i purchased a jukebox 3 from creative almost a year ago .
__label__0 i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .
__label__0 awesome feature .
__label__0 i 've bought 3 apex dvd players now .
__label__0 they told me i would have to connect to my laptop , which had to be on and connected to my corporate network through the phone in order to access my corporate email .
__label__1 if you want a sexy , cool , accessory-availible mp3 player , by all means , get an ipod for a hundred dollars more ( or one for the same price that holds 1/3 of the music ) .
__label__0 ( but as any hard drive , all of them freeze at certain points )
__label__0 the g2 was better in this respect .
__label__0 i 'm starting to listen to cd 's that i have n't listened to in years now that i have them all handy in one place .
__label__0 also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player .
__label__0 meaning i do n't have to manually clear the list , and then load the new list .
__label__0 the one and most major thing that i was dissapointed with , in this player , is the battery life .
__label__0 having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying .
__label__0 i bought it for my trip to beunos aires , and also used it at the iguazu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance !
__label__0 even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio .
__label__0 although they accepted that they will ship on mon - 6 jan , they still did n't ship it .
__label__0 the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) .
__label__0 but they offer only a 3-month warranty ( on all of their players , including the zen xtra ) .
__label__0 i also got myself a 512mb viking compact flash ( enough for 255 shots at full 4mp resolution and max picture quality ) and a used $ 250 3lb subnotebook with usb connection and tons of hard drive space for long trips so i can verify what i 've taken and that subnotebook also saves me from having to buy extra compactflash .
__label__0 + the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .
__label__1 i would recommend against using id3v2 tags , and stick with id3v1 only .
__label__0 the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's .
__label__0 i was cruising around the device within 20 minutes .
__label__0 so far we have only hooked up one of them .
__label__0 it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk .
__label__0 i do n't need to go into exhustive review of this camera .
__label__0 when plugged in , it does n't lag the computer like the archos did ... unless you are doing a massive transfer of data in one load .
__label__0 5 . the zen does not have a stop button !
__label__0 the only good thing about this whole process , is that im getting like a 34 dollar amount back , because of the price difference between when i bought it , and now .
__label__0 nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .
__label__0 there is usb , though .
__label__0 games are ok for a cell phone , but mp3 's are for music .
__label__0 cheaper in every way .
__label__0 i also had it happen when recording a jazz set where there were a number of outtakes of the same song without numbering them separately .
__label__0 other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .
__label__0 if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get  stuck  rapidly going through the songs and wo n't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it .
__label__0 battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k. reeves .
__label__0 the rio karma feedback suffers from sensitivity in the hard disk .
__label__0 i am very pleased so far .
__label__0 it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies .
__label__1 and finally , get your pictures developed at a kodak picture maker machine even though it costs you a little extra - no one can beat kodak processing in terms of clarity and brightness .
__label__0 ( 2 ) there are , actually , several differences between the g2 and g3 , such as differences in continuous shooting , the optical lens , the control layout , playback zoom , image processing , and so on .
__label__0 installed software .
__label__0 my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .
__label__0 after that it seems like you 're on your own .
__label__0 i have used this phone for two months now .
__label__0 i 'm live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators .
__label__0 it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .
__label__0 it is easy to  focus  in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera .
__label__0 this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he 'd answered all my questions ( same interaction as i just described ) , and well .. .
__label__0 i 've tried someone elses and the same thing happens .
__label__0 this is not a player you can take jogging .
__label__0 first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good .. .
__label__0 size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .
__label__0 the earbuds that come with it are n't that bad .
__label__0 i would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering .
__label__0 now i know why - they are pieces of junk .
__label__0 i have n't checked the resilience of my xtra yet , and do n't plan to .
__label__0 after fiddling around with it for a while , i notice a few dissapointments :
__label__0 no more annoying series of beeps .
__label__0 so i do n't understand why it would not work with dvds that seem to have more features in them .
__label__1 do n't be pulled in by the great price -- you get what you pay for , and there 's a reason this model is so cheap .
__label__0 it did have scored over all other competitors ....
__label__0 good thing i got a replacement plan .
__label__0 the dvd player does not work properly .
__label__0 by the way , it looks nice also .
__label__0 so i pop-in my first dvd and start to watch .
__label__0 bluetooth functionality would have made the phone even better .
__label__0 if there are any drawbacks to this phone here they are .
__label__0 the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle .
__label__0 i even went as far as calling the technical support number on the disc .
__label__0 there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc .
__label__1 i would also recommend buying an extra battery and at least a 128 mb compact flash type i memory card .
__label__0 can 't say whether i rec 'd an  updated  model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me .
__label__0 i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player .
__label__0 win software can be a little cranky , but much more easier to customize to your needs .
__label__0 here 's why :
__label__0 by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stopaction photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced .
__label__0 if it worked like that in south africa , i imagine it would just work without a hitch in europe .
__label__0 resources : http://www.nomadworld.com, http://www.nomadness.net
__label__0 i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds .
__label__0 seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection .
__label__0 the screen 's large and easily read .
__label__0 takes excellent photos .
__label__1 if this doesnt bring back the picture, try pressing this button without playing a dvd .
__label__0 overall , a very disappointing product .
__label__0 i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus .
__label__0 no instructions .
__label__0 however , the music and data are apparently not separated ; ipod reviewers complain about  white noise  in random feedback mode that comes from appointments / contacts created on the ipod during synchronization .
__label__0 i have a large collection of cds and have loaded over 100 of them so far .
__label__0 playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options .
__label__0 i bought my nikon coolpix4300 about a week ago .
__label__0 best regards sadoun satellite sales
__label__0 it costs like 200 dollars to replace - now you mail it off to get the battery replaced for like 99 .. .
__label__0 its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38; phone lying by your pillowside .
__label__0 if you have a good digital camera , there is no reason to consider the camera capabilities of a mobile phone .
__label__0 i returned it once , then i sent it back , and it is crap .
__label__0 the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend .
__label__0 and since the current language selection was english (even though i think only the menu supports chinese , and not the track info ) ... all it saw were  ?  s and even though the songs had different names in chinese ..
__label__0 overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it .
__label__0 flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get overilluminated main subjects with depth being lost .
__label__0 this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models .
__label__0 if only it played stand alone avi files .
__label__0 the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly
__label__0 the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone elses is too .
__label__0 the sony ericsson phone ( t610 ) has the most whistles and bells , but is also the hardest to use .
__label__0 3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use .
__label__0 worth every penny !
__label__0 i do not know a whole lot about photography , but i am happy to know that this camera can always perform , even as i grow in skill and knowledge .
__label__0 the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity .
__label__0 quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time .
__label__0 my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of .
__label__0 7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .
__label__1 if you arent hooked up to cddb to get the album info i guess you have to manually input the stuff , but that little work will save you looking for songs .
__label__0 no go on most formats .
__label__0 the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .
__label__1 i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price .
__label__0 so i had to give up and return it , having lost about 4 hours .
__label__0 this is a wonderful camera .
__label__0 i did n't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .
__label__0 here 's where the ipod drives me nuts .
__label__0 sure enough there is no such ability .
__label__0 for the average music listener not expecting much ... this may be a satisfactory mp3 player ...
__label__0 took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo .
__label__0 to say the least , i was horribly dissatisified with my service with sprint , which was why t-mobile was so fantastically refreshing .
__label__0 huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .
__label__0 to my amazement , even that process was error-prone .
__label__0 you might think you are saving money by buying an apex but in the long run you will spend more .
__label__0 yes the ipod is smaller , but not $ 200 worth , which is the premium you 'll pay for an equivalent capacity model .
__label__0 it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .
__label__0 the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !
__label__0 well , it was nice while it lasted .
__label__0 but there are two things i do n't like about the camera that were not mentioned in any previous reviews .
__label__0 they sell an adapter unit to use with your car 's cassette deck .
__label__0 also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n't always accurate .
__label__0 but for now it appears that this player does n't play well with itunes .
__label__0 after os froze twice on me in the subway i returned the jukebox .
__label__0 i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .
__label__0 i also registered the unit online and posted two messages to the apex support person ( there can 't possibly be more than one !
__label__0 lithium ion rechargeable batteries are good for 300-500 rechargings , so battery lifespan will vary according to your usage .
__label__0 5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control .
__label__0 the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market .
__label__0 perhaps there is a tone of irony in the title of my review , but i actually mean it in earnest .
__label__0 so now i 've got to call their customer  service  ( of course , no 800 number ) to send the thing back .
__label__0 the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .
__label__0 so far i 've only had it since christmas , so i cant tell you much about the battery life .
__label__0 also , the display is  hinged  and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .
__label__0 there are a lot of things i like about it .
__label__0 i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .
__label__0 at the same time , i wanted my wife to not be intimidated by knobs and buttons .
__label__0 the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .
__label__0 the files are there , but i could not access the player without removing the battery , waiting a short period and re-inserting the battery .
__label__1 if you want to be a poser and follow the herd , mooooooh , then buy the i-pod .
__label__0 accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .
__label__0 creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static .
__label__1 a card with more memory is a must .
__label__0 i chose to keep the ipod and am very happy with the purchase .
__label__0 nearly 4000 songs went up in smoke .
__label__0 none of these features are available because of the ipod 's 1-way transfers - you cannot make changes on the ipod that are premanent .
__label__0 no way , now i have an ipod and i 'm a very happy man .
__label__0 my office would not let me put the software on to my work computer .
__label__0 i do n't want to install software and drivers on every computer i 'm ever at .
__label__0 and really this is the best phone one could have .
__label__0 it seems that depending on the system the software might not work or might work , because it works on all the other computers i have .
__label__0 i also own an  apex ad 1201  dvd player and have had no problems with it since i purchased it almost 1 1/2 years ago .
__label__0 i find myself emailing pics to everyone i know .
__label__1 also , if you 're an audiophile , you 'll want to get your own cables because the supplied ones are thin and short .
__label__0 this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before .
__label__0 the door would not close .
__label__0 i got this phone in t-mobile 's current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal .
__label__0 after a lot of research , i decided on the g3 .
__label__1 i cannot recommend it enough ! !
__label__0 or on the rare occasion it does you can bring it into any t-mobile store , which are located in many countries in europe .
__label__0 pro : 1 .
__label__0 i did buy separate headphones as other have recommended .
__label__0 so i 'm screwed .
__label__0 i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product .
__label__0 manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .
__label__0 unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs .
__label__0 first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most asthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture .
__label__0 beats that sony f717 ; its archrival .
__label__0 the dvd player is fine .
__label__0 excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jvc players .
__label__0 the prints are beautiful !
__label__0 i 'm not looking forward to ripping my entire collection every month or two .
__label__0 your child is going to do a cannonball off the diving board , so you compose the shot and wait for your moment .
__label__0 a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .
__label__0 it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in .
__label__0 i have n't used any of them since i got the g3 .
__label__0 does n't always register push-button movement .
__label__0 the radio feature has superb sound quality .
__label__0 night mode is clear as day .
__label__1 in summary , i love this camera and would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range .
__label__0 nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .
__label__0 the vibrate setting is loud !
__label__0 i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down .
__label__0 it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine .
__label__0 one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date .
__label__0 the pros :
__label__0 although you may think you 're dealing with amazon , you 're dealing with some second rate store that you 've never heard of .
__label__0 ok , everybody loves the fm radio in this , but you want a cell phone first , right ?
__label__0 the g3 looks like a work of art !
__label__0 i got this a while ago knowing nothing about it .
__label__0 battery life :
__label__0 this is pretty cool .
__label__0 the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .
__label__0 so what are you waiting for ?
__label__0 2 ) scroll button / switch
__label__0 so far not going to get a good review .
__label__0 ok this is our first dvd player so what do i know .
__label__0 pictures produced by the minolta were orange but not blurry .
__label__0 learning how to use it will not take very long .
__label__1 you need your computer , however , if you want to add tracks to a playlist .
__label__0 i have not used the progressive scan feature .
__label__0 the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras .
__label__0 i am using notmad explorer to move music & playlists between the zen & my computer .
__label__0 when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .
__label__0 use this for 18 months every day and see what happens , or look at a 2 year old electric razor and see if it holds the same charge as the first day you had it ) .
__label__0 i have an older computer , running windows 98 se , and so those of you with something more recent would find the process even quicker .
__label__0 this is extemely lame .
__label__1 if you have always on internet or are logged into the internet you can use the feature that will download the album & song id information ( this is a free service ) with the click of a button .
__label__0 3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .
__label__0 i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones .
__label__0 the camera has a wonderful set of features .
__label__0 this junky is super duper rad. it be my fav c-phone and stuff .
__label__0 only con i can think of is no camera ... .
__label__0 on several different occasions it has displayed  no disc  with a disc inside .
__label__0 lastly , you cannot manage anything on the ipod itself .
__label__0 the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you .
__label__0 1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .
__label__0 i have had no problems with the phone .
__label__0 it took maybe 15 minutes to transfer 1000 songs .
__label__0 but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive !
__label__0 had to cut out a window using a swiss army knife .
__label__0 the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly .
__label__0 of course you do !
__label__0 overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .
__label__0 you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i.e. free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jme you can even make your own apps / games .
__label__0 it 's not the end of the world , but a better design sure would be nice .
__label__1 transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .
__label__0 9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .
__label__0 still , had to send it back to nikon for repair .
__label__0 one beef is the scroll , it does n't work as well as i 'd like .
__label__0 i hope i have helped you continue to enjoy the apex dvd player with these troubleshooting tips .
__label__0 i own a 35mm slr camera and this is my second digital .
__label__0 but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary .. .
__label__0 the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .
__label__0 i 'd look elsewhere .
__label__0 do n't let my five star rating fool you .
__label__0 the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .
__label__0 the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ?
__label__0 battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so .
__label__0 picture on web site clearly has the play display pictured , yet false silver plate .
__label__0 even viewed cds full of jpgs .
__label__0 as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable .
__label__0 when i bought it late last year , there were enough reviews that i knew the navigation wheel and software would be less than ideal , but it sounded like a fair tradeoff .
__label__0 as i emailed to the the customer service department , the only thing this player has done consistantly is use enought electricity to keep the red led burning .
__label__0 overall an excellent phone .
__label__1 what the photoshop plug-in gives you is reality , and then if you want fantasy , you can use photoshop to create it .
__label__0 the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .
__label__0 i then installed the software manually instead , after having to click past about 5 windows of  please register with us so we can spam your inbox  .
__label__1 if you shoot in lots of light and desire high quality , this will be your camera .
__label__0 i just got it today and have tried to verify the claims of other reviewers .
__label__0 it is small .
__label__0 4 ) the viewfinder is borderuer lcd scoying .
__label__0 c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said
__label__0 with the t-mobile unlimited t-zones for $ 10 , i can check any number of email addresses and use unlimited internet .
__label__0 i believe the napster mp3 player has this feature .
__label__0 the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .
__label__0 in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
__label__1 i would recommend replacing the existing software with the  notmad explorer ,  which is simpler to use and can be found on the internet .
__label__0 strengths are well listed by other reviewers .
__label__0 the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it .
__label__0 they were n't busy enough to charge the credit card , though !
__label__0 i applied a $ 25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying $ 29 for this machine .
__label__0 the g3 completely takes over controlling the duration of the metz flash , and most of the time , the exposure is spot on and when it isnt , its because youve exceeded the range of the metz flash itself .
__label__0 i have not yet discovered the internet features yet , which i will be doing soon .
__label__1 my recommendation is to wait on buying one from this company as they will surely get sent a message of many returned dvd players after christmas 2003 .
__label__0 after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures .
__label__1 for those of you who has problems with this player , i 'd suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture , etc.
__label__1 do n't buy this thing .
__label__0 however , if you are keen , you can attach a camera to this phone .
__label__0 i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .
__label__0 it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it .
__label__0 i charged it up the day i got it , took a bunch of pictures and i do n't think the battery indicator has budged from fully charged .
__label__0 i can 't fit all that resolution ( 4mp = 2272x 1704 resol . ) in my 19in flat monitor ( 1200x1024 resol . ) anyways .
__label__0 we are overall pleased with product .
__label__0 picture scrolling in b/w :
__label__0 nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .
__label__0 ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .
__label__0 but , i would definately recommend this phone .
__label__0 so if you have xp , be prepared for this and do n't be alarmed .
__label__0 this is a good deal for music and data storage .
__label__0 most people love the appearance and praise the touch sensitive buttons .
__label__0 the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so .
__label__0 wow .. .
__label__0 also love waking up to music with attached speakers .
__label__0 sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much .
__label__1 do n't buy this player .
__label__0 guess where this unit is headed ?
__label__0 while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability .
__label__1 if you watch dvds once in a while like i do , get this !
__label__0 if the dvd is stopped , it will display  playback only  .
__label__0 i checked with nokia .
__label__0 but once in a while , i run up against it 's major flaw :
__label__0 i was perfectly happy with my g2 , so why did i trade up to the g3 ?
__label__0 navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .
__label__0 i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did .
__label__0 a great new use for that underutilized computer .
__label__0 unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is  player either not connected or busy .
__label__0 this was not a problem for me as most of my collection was ripped from my own cds and i updated the id3 tags on my downloaded music .
__label__1 just get some new headphones and your set .
__label__0 one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .
__label__1 you should update the firmware before upgrading the drivers if you decide you need the newer drivers for the pc.
__label__0 i always research electronics online before i buy because even within the same company , some models are better than others .
__label__0 i have not spent much time with the included software , so i don't know what to say about it other than it seems ok .
__label__0 the pc quickly picked up on it and attempted to install the software , which failed , as creative chose not to follow microsoft standards , whatever .
__label__0 i went to an at &#38; t store before i bought this phone to see if it was possible to get corporate email with any of their services and they looked at me like i had three heads .
__label__1 buy this for the storage and price , avoid it if you know nothing about computers .
__label__0 i love my g2 so thought i would upgrade .
__label__0 the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .
__label__0 and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey !
__label__0 after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .
__label__0 great features . .
__label__0 i have n't tried setting up any playlists yet so i can 't comment on any problems there .
__label__0 this seemed like a really good compromise .
__label__0 overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it .
__label__0 and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play .
__label__0 the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .
__label__1 go out and get a 256meg card , it 's worth the expense .
__label__0 the upgrade went smoothly and was easy to do if you can follow directions .
__label__0 and then it just froze and now i 'm out $ 300 for their piece of junk .
__label__0 right now , i 'm researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that 's designed for digital cameras .
__label__0 i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vob files which i created with smart ripper .
__label__1 i did n't use it long enough to know , but clearly you need to use it with caution .
__label__0 only if we could get one camera in it . .
__label__0 the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance .
__label__0 recently i accidently washed my telephone with my laundry through two complete 18 minute wash cycles of a washing machine .
__label__0 like some other reviewers , i recieved this phone using t-mobiles upgrade program .
__label__0 if you tossed it out of  the window , you need to fetch it .
__label__0 the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla .
__label__0 once you hook the thing up to the computer ( via the usb cable ) , the machine instantly recognizes the fact that it 's there & installs the drivers .
__label__0 a lot of my opinions are more relevant for those who are switching from film .
__label__0 easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot .
__label__0 i think the whole zen line has been fairly innovative and reasonably priced , but it 's not really appropriate to compare the pricing of the zen line to the ipods ( although , the ipod is still way over priced ) .
__label__0 and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 .
__label__0 the cons are n't really a big deal to me ... except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files ... no folder structure ... and it 's based on the title of the songs ... many of my songs where seperated into folders ( on the pc ) ... and a few had same titles ... so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n't have any that might be the same as another .
__label__0 this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cdr / cdrw / dvdr / dvdrw , and of course plays dvd movies from uk. i love the aiff , progressive scan feature .
__label__0 i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player .
__label__0 the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .
__label__0 i purchased the phone last week and have been using till then . .
__label__0 this also allows you to turn on the camera on without having to remove the lens cap .
__label__0 it has many great features and very few bad ones .
__label__0 card reader is included .
__label__0 for the money apex machines have good features .
__label__0 i paid twenty dollars more than the current price , and even then it was a steal .
__label__0 if i had to do this again , i might get the 40gb zen .
__label__0 * scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models .
__label__0 aight den bumpy ?
__label__0 the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :
__label__0 i called them twice and both times they said it is  about to ship  .
__label__0 bought this product about a month ago and have used it in a variety of situations .
__label__0 the second one is up and running .
__label__0 who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out , but it probably will .
__label__0 i finally decided to upgrade , and started my research .
__label__0 the t610 has the most functionality hands down .
__label__0 1 . i do n't need the nomad at the office .
__label__1 if you want a quality mp3 player , splurge on an ipod .
__label__0 the headphone jack acts as a pseudo line out jack .
__label__0 just bought one & i 've enjoyed it to date .
__label__0 another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .
__label__1 please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .
__label__0 - sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .
__label__0 about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc .
__label__0 * lens visible in optical viewfinder .
__label__0 anything this phone does , it does perfectly .
__label__1 make sure you get a big compactflash card ( it comes with a 32mb ) -- the 512mb cards are pretty [ inexpensive ] here on amazon.com and can hold about 500 photos at a time !
__label__0 video output stopped workin .
__label__0 i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .
__label__0 in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .
__label__0 not just the transfer software ( which was a hellishly horrible experience ) but also the player 's software .
__label__0 i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites .
__label__0 if you do any research into digital cameras , you 'll quickly find that this camera is just about the best value out there .
__label__0 it 's probably good for the health of your ears , however i consistently play it near the high end of the volume range ( and my hearing is fine ).
__label__0 that 's probably a bad thing .
__label__0 in the last month i bought the apex ad-1600 and the ad-1220 .
__label__0 it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice .
__label__0 when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light .
__label__0 we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but cannot be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use .
__label__0 itunes does what apple is famous for , makes software that works for the less computer saavy .
__label__0 i am a nikon fan , and owned and used slr nikon fe , n50 and n90s for many many years .
__label__0 the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .
__label__0 the shutter lag is on par with what i 've experienced with point and shoot 35mm and aps film cameras and the next frame advance is about a couple seconds using a high speed 12x 128mb compact flash card a salesperson recommended the high speed card since next frame advance speed was important to me - and it was only a few dollars more .
__label__0 so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out .
__label__0 that player is a complete piece of sh ***.
__label__0 excellent range of metering options as well .
__label__0 they authorized my late return , and hopefully they are giving apex heck .
__label__0 what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e. , mp3s ) .
__label__0 i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept .
__label__0 when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with .
__label__0 i have a 128mb card in it and can shoot over 150 hi res photos .
__label__0 the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing .
__label__0 i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough .
__label__0 got a  system error  problem 30 days after purchase .
__label__1 in order for this to work , you have to set the camera to manual mode and set the shutter speed and f-stop yourself .
__label__0 for example , jimi hendrix 's 2 cd live at the fillmore east had one cd classifed as classic rock and the other psychidelic rock .
__label__0 i refused to go for an ipod , i am not going to spend all that money just for the apple name and because it is  trendy  to have that player .
__label__0 that beside you are prob. very well aware of many of the features that this phone is known for , and one that has not yet been mentioned : using this phone as a modem for any computer with a usb 1.0 port !
__label__0 my personal favorite is the karma ( i currently own a karma , a zen usb 2.0 , a philips hdd100 , and an upgraded 60 gig archos jukebox recorder ).
__label__0 in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .
__label__0 this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made .
__label__0 for more , you sacrifice weight and size : more optical zoom requires more glass and focal length .
__label__0 the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an  auto  mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .
__label__0 it was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid .
__label__0 it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented .
__label__0 if it can fit in the drive bay , this dvd player will play it .
__label__0 this phone plays up to 4 tones at one time and it actually sounds like music .
__label__0 after having had my heart broken by a sexy piece of hardware that simply would n't perform .
__label__0 a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models .
__label__0 at first i thought it was my headphones but it was not .
__label__0 final verdict :
__label__0 first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .
__label__0 itunes is a versatile program and i have n't had any issues with the ipod itself .
__label__1 bottom line for me is that for the price i do n't think you can go wrong at all by purchasing this dvd player .
__label__0 i guess that i can not complain since it does not actually claim to play vcd / svcd formats , but others say they can .
__label__0 overall this is a slightly better than average phone .
__label__0 8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows mediaplayer , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cddb service ( gracenotes ).
__label__1 unless you want to print murals , you do n't need it .
__label__0 pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery
__label__0 would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing .
__label__0 it 's horrible .
__label__0 the image quality is excellent .
__label__0 the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well recored mp3s .
__label__0 the 6610 is the actually the longest but they are all very small .
__label__0 i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great .
__label__0 it would just spin up and stop , and display  no disc  .
__label__0 the software , mediasource , cannot work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2.0 , xp os ) .
__label__0 over time , i loaded hundreds of cds onto the computer , and the idea of carrying around all of my music with me became attractive .
__label__0 it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .
__label__0 great price .
__label__0 you do take your chances with this phone .
__label__0 and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers .
__label__0 in a word ,  awesome  is how i would describe this camera .
__label__1 if you purchase this product , definitely rip your songs through windows media player .
__label__0 i bought the apex ad-2600 dvd player for the family for christmas .
__label__0 i have not yet tried the cd-ripping program .
__label__0 this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone .
__label__0 in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models !
__label__0 the fact that the  0  key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the  #  key instead .
__label__0 a great buy .
__label__0 why i do n't can this product without a plan ?
__label__0 for the most part this is a good dvd player .
__label__0 you got to have flash ' on ' to get it eventhough your room is well lit
__label__0 after all those players have 40-60 gb of hard drive , so better organization is required .
__label__0 my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .
__label__0 well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic ) .
__label__0 the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .
__label__0 apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .
__label__1 i 'd recommend against this unit .
__label__0 the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .
__label__0 plugged it in .
__label__0 purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it .
__label__0 i bought this only to have it break within a month .
__label__0 if you decide to encode at 320 you will fit less on this device than someone who encodes at 128kps .
__label__0 after finally stumbling upon this zen nx player , i knew i had found what i was looking for .
__label__0 with apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it .
__label__0 now we come to the zen xtra .. .
__label__1 but for $ 49.99 go get one !
__label__0 of course , unlike that person i will mention that i upgraded the firmware to 1.23 . 00. but i did transfer files before the upgrade without problem too .
__label__0 bought two ad2600 's for christmas .
__label__0 the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough .
__label__0 it also has unproven battery life .
__label__0 the phone does have voice dialing according to amazon & t-mobile and nokia .
__label__0 things that i 'd prefer different - there 's a red light that shines when it 's turned off !
__label__1 if you buy a creative mp3 player , be sure to get the optional extended warranty .
__label__0 i really have no complaints over this unit .
__label__0 it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims .
__label__0 what a mistake !
__label__0 my goal of using it as a music player * and * data storage device has not been met ; do n't make the same mistake .
__label__0 four megapixels is great .
__label__0 unfortunately it turns out to be the  disposable  type .
__label__0 i am averaging 4.5 mb per song , to give you an idea of how many songs you can get by the amount of memory .
__label__0 disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine , i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone .
__label__0 i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual .
__label__0 5 hours max. i did it like this
__label__0 * price and capacity
__label__0 and have you seen the price of the ipod extras that you need .
__label__0 i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better .
__label__0 i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category .
__label__0 i got 45 outdoor and 15 indoor shots with the monitor on turning the camera off and on over a 4 hour period before the battery died .
__label__0 excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .
__label__0 i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since .
__label__0 3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .
__label__0 finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order .
__label__0 i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .
__label__0 i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive .
__label__0 i do hope that they offer more faceplate options .
__label__0 i purchased this phone after having been an at &#38; t subscriber with a nokia 8260 phone for over three years .
__label__0 but canon never fails to amaze .
__label__0 i do n't write many reviews but i 'm compelled to do so with this camera .
__label__0 when compared to the ipod the zen xtra falls short , but only by a bit .
__label__0 veteran zen users have explained how to stop if that 's what you want .
__label__0 when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .
__label__0 after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty .
__label__1 if you 're a bargain hunter and you want a great feature set for a rock-bottom price , i highly recommend this model .
__label__0 also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore  the  when it lists the cds in alphabetical order .
__label__0 customer service and technical support are overloaded and nonresponsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them .
__label__1 i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period !
__label__0 1 ) a spare battery would have been great .
__label__1 despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography .
__label__0 being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .
__label__0 6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed .
__label__0 i guess i 'm just lucky to get a good working unit !
__label__0 i would replace them with some better sounding and more comfortable phones .
__label__0 the software lets you pop in a cd and then scans the internet to name the artist , track name and album name .
__label__0 color screen is good .
__label__0 my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature .
__label__0 the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .
__label__0 my one recommendation to creative is to get some marketing people to work on the names of these things .
__label__0 first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .
__label__0 i did extensive research before chosing the g3 but there 's nothing like picking one up and playing with it first .
__label__0 and for those that are intrested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ).
__label__0 some feature i could turn on or off , or some attachment i could get .
__label__0 and also , it 's priced very affordably .
__label__0 hope the unit lasts as i 've only had it for 3 days .
__label__1 while it seems like some people have had trouble with theirs , mine has run well , and i would recommend it if you are considering a dvd player purchase .
__label__0 this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is !
__label__0 1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its progam and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n't want to bother with the settings .
__label__0 i can take better pictures with this then my rebel ti with a good lens .
__label__0 because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !
__label__1 before you try to return the player or waste hours calling apex tech support , or run the player over with your car, try these simple troubleshooting ideas first .
__label__0 ( 28 not 30 because software itself takes space ) .
__label__0 1 no direct firewire to the camera .
__label__0 t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's .
__label__0 - the unit is easy to use and intuitive .
__label__0 to summarize , i am using the creative zen as a mobile device ;
__label__0 the software could n't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .
__label__0 friends of mine are always asking about it and wanting to use it .
__label__0 in fact , everyone who saw it thought i was  the man  and wo n't believe i returned it .
__label__0 called customer service and basically was told to either keep buying univ. remotes to try or buy the replacement remote for $ 23 ( which is almost half of what i paid for the whole player ) .
__label__0 the device is larger than an ipod of similar capacity .
__label__0 the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .
__label__0 so then i came across the ipod ( 10 gb ) .
__label__1 save money on the long run - buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month .
__label__0 bought this player after reading the reviews here which identify it as reading most formats including dvd + rw 's and vcd 's .
__label__0 always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .
__label__0 before i decided to get this player , i did my research .
__label__0 they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy .
__label__0 unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed .
__label__0 if that one fails too , and i hope if it does , let it happen in the first 90 days , not later , cuz thats the warranty .
__label__0 looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .
__label__0 only used for 3 month before it 's down !
__label__0 i had an older camera that was simply a point and shoot camera .
__label__0 also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4.99 / mo. ) never works .
__label__0 for a 250 dollar player , they could have thrown in nice headphones .
__label__0 this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) .
__label__0 unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n't play all my dvds , and now the player can 't play everything .
__label__0 i wanted a dvd player that had basic features and would be able to play dvd - r format disc 's that i had made myself .
__label__0 my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !
__label__1 you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd .
__label__0 after about 45 mins of listening there was audible static in the player .
__label__0 great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc.
__label__0 hope i 've been of some help .
__label__0 . images taken indoor were n't so clear .
__label__0 the person i talked to suggested i take the dvd player back and swap it out with another .
__label__0 and no t-zones .
__label__0 all the above , i think , are problems with all the digital cameras out there and so i have no major complaints .
__label__0 ( looks quite neat too suggesting that canon may have , er , canonized it a bit ).
__label__0 those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .
__label__0 you can always spend more money to get a better one .
__label__0 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .
__label__0 whe you transfer your songs to the jukebox , it dumps all of them into a single folder , and then sorts them by the id3 tags.
__label__0 i was impressed by this very inexpensive player.for the first three hours , and then it died .
__label__0 alright , well i read alot of these reviews , and i read alot of bad and good things about this player .
__label__0 but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street .. .
__label__0 just point and shoot and the photos were great .
__label__0 i am bored with the silver look .
__label__0 b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage .
__label__1 so rule of thumb , no matter what you end up buying , get the extended warranty !
__label__0 how easy is it for me to get to a certain menu ?
__label__0 the sound from the player is ok .
__label__0 for some reason they made the navigation buttons all one button , a ring around the enter / play button .
__label__0 this means that you will have the nomad long enough to load a lot of music on to it , and get used to having it .
__label__0 but that 's a moot point now .
__label__0 it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls .
__label__0 this is the best dvd player i 've purchased .
__label__0 i use a 128mb card , and usually get around 70 to 100 pics 1024-1280 res. , with good resolution .
__label__0 i can 't imagine why i would spend hundreds of dollars more to have an ipod .
__label__1 artist , album and genre are only mp3 tags which are supported buy this player , and if you have 100 artists would be good to have another subcategory .
__label__0 i paid $ 49 and now it 's $ 125 !
__label__0 my case doesnt close ... maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great .
__label__0 two months ago , an internal part failed ( not due to customer abuse ; it just failed ) .
__label__0 i know the saying is  you get what you pay for  but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse .
__label__0 the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls ( real estate broker software ) very well at all .
__label__0 i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it .
__label__0 1. creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; 3,400 tracks ; 12.5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ?
__label__0 the included earbuds were uncomfortable .
__label__0 i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .
__label__0 it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .
__label__0 before anyone says hey you have n't used the product , i have , my friend received one for christmas instead of an ipod and has since envied me for my vastly superior product .
__label__0 this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .
__label__0 finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy .
__label__0 - the cover that came with it did n't fit very well
__label__0 usb 2.0 - very fast
__label__0 i chose the canon speedlite 420 .
__label__0 4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms .
__label__0 i have owned an apex ad-3201 for close to 3 years now and i love that deck .
__label__0 because of the large capacity of the nomad , owners can load hundreds of cds on to it .
__label__0 audio on video also lacking .
__label__0 . lens cap is a really annoying
__label__0 somewhat disappointed that i could not  hook up  to my sony multi brand remote commander .
__label__0 i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this .
__label__0 granted this is cheaper than an ipod .
__label__0 i use mine at the office , in the car ( with a cassette adapter ) , and will be taking it on a flight back east for the holiday .
__label__0 on my main computer the software did not work right .
__label__0 that 's the first thing to understand .
__label__0 only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .
__label__0 forget about it .
__label__0 this is an edited review , now that i have had time to use the device .
__label__0 the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .
__label__0 while i would like to give it 3.5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it .
__label__0 1 ) fm receiver - some models out there have this .
__label__0 it is great to no longer wonder what music i want to take with me for a cross country flight or a two week trip - now i just take everything .
__label__0 if i 'd been paying attention , i would have noticed the 3 month warranty .
__label__0 first let me give you the bad things :
__label__0 you will have a very expensive paperweight .
__label__0 since the zen xtra does not use a folder structure , the  duplicate name  problem stems from the actual file name , not from the song 's title / artist / album .
__label__0 you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly .
__label__0 i 've had it for a week now , do n't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it .
__label__0 i eventually gave up with customer support and worked on fixing the problem myself .
__label__0 i 've gotten used to it ( holding it in just the right realation to the ear , ducking into quieter places in bars ) but when others borrow it they 're shocked i can use it .
__label__0 i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n't do it !
__label__0 the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n't as easy as the ipod 's , or as  sexy  looking .
__label__0 radio is awsome , but it does n't work unless you have the earpice in .
__label__0 i have no complaints with this mp3 player .
__label__0 ipod has no stop button ; when new users mention this ipod veterans call it  unnecessary  and  so 20th century  .
__label__0 considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .
__label__0 now my dissapointments .
__label__0 not a big hassle as many would have you think .
__label__0 it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds .
__label__0 no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers .
__label__0 then you can say ,  my dissapointment only cost $ 39 .
__label__0 i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad .
__label__0 i shot over 300 photos at my goddaughter 's birthday party without switching out to my backup battery .
__label__0 with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod .
__label__0 what 's going on creative labs ?
__label__1 i enthusiastically recommend this camera .
__label__0 so , i bought apex ad-2600 in november ' 03 from amazon .
__label__0 i was considering the olympus camedia c-5050 but was convinced to buy the g3 after visiting a store and holding it in my hands and trying it out .
__label__0 well , this apex dvd player turned out great !
__label__0 after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .
__label__0 the reason it does not get 5 stars
__label__0 operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie lebovitz , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .
__label__0 i can only hear the sound but no picture !
__label__0 so sit back , relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can 't do half the things this one can , and for a fraction of the price !
__label__0 the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .
__label__0 at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .
__label__0 size and style :
__label__1 i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime .
__label__0 first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .
__label__0 when you load a disc , you go to an internet cite for the insertion of the names for the cd and the tracks .
__label__0 i am returning the broken one today .
__label__0 so much packed in a small case and very affordable !
__label__0 i therefore bought a second battery as a backup , and due to the lightingfast charging with the included charger , which by the way works on 110v as well as 220v in europe , we ran never out of  juice  .
__label__0 the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
__label__0 enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .
__label__0 i saw another review saying his only gripe was a lack of voice dialing .
__label__0 i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it .
__label__0 oh ... one more thing .
__label__0 the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use .
__label__0 they sent me a new ad2600 with the same problem .
__label__0 relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots .
__label__0 i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets .
__label__0 for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price .
__label__0 the only creative software i am using is the device driver ( s ).
__label__1 for those of you who already bought this camera , i suggest you buy a hi-ti dye-sub photo printer .
__label__0 this is rarely a problem with any kind of popular music , but can be troublesome with classical music where tracks are identified by tempi .
__label__1 pass this player up , and never believe the reviews on a product right before christmas !
__label__0 now , i suddenly have no picture .
__label__0 5 ) handle the player with care - it is not meant to be dropped .
__label__0 i think most of you people complaining about no video is due to you hitting the wrong button either the p/n = pal / ntsc or the i/p is set to progressive scan .
__label__0 what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds .
__label__1 1 ) buy an extended coverage if offered by the retailer as this device has moving parts and is essentially a portable hard-drive .
__label__0 i agree with the positive reviews .
__label__0 i did n't even try the included software .
__label__0 many reviewers say the faceplate simply did n't fit well so they returned the zen .
__label__0 the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .
__label__0 lastly , ipod / itunes will not play wma formatted songs .
__label__1 if you dont get video back , now you can run the player over with your car !
__label__0 i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes .
__label__1 needless to say , i would n't recommend anyone purchasing this product .
__label__0 that said , they are pretty sturdy machines and i would n't let this dissuade you from getting an mp3 with a lot of memory .
__label__0 perhaps there is a way around this delay .
__label__0 i recently bought this after my archos 20 multimedia self-destructed ( do n't get me started on that piece of junk ! ) and expected it to be flawless .
__label__0 i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy .
__label__0 note : about 2gb ( 5 % ) of the advertised 40gb of storage capacity is used for the operating software ( firmware ) .
__label__0 gee ... thanks a lot creative .
__label__0 1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's  unspecified  ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .
__label__0 overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !
__label__0 so i finally gave them a deadline which they said they could meet .
__label__0 sent mine back .
__label__0 i have my mp3 's stored on my workstation .
__label__0 the casing scratches a little easy , but the glove cases work great to protect against this .
__label__0 the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .
__label__0 the battery life on this phone is surreal .
__label__0 i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever .
__label__0 the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal .
__label__0 9 . in dim lit environs the g2 could easily outperform any other camera , and thankfully g3 maintains this rep .
__label__0 any disadvantages are easily outweighed by its advantages .
__label__0 the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .
__label__0 also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy .
__label__0 i did that and re-installed the software but had the same error .
__label__0 it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .
__label__0 this would not be a great problem if you did n't have so much info to scroll through on a regular basis .
__label__0 cameras capture moments .
__label__0 one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .
__label__0 just for the heck of it , i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door , and the focusing was just fine .
__label__0 i refuse to buy anything made by apple and the nomad is about $ 200 cheaper anyway .
__label__0 with our compact 35mm broken , and a vacation in europe at hand , i finally decided to enter the digital age .
__label__0 i considered this phone ( nokia 6610 ) , mainly because of my sister and the features .
__label__0 t-mobile was a pretty good server .
__label__0 still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features !
__label__0 the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .
__label__0 another point of note : the battery life is incredible !
__label__0 i first bought a 6 gig nomad jukebox ( original ).
__label__0 i like the size and weight of this little critter .
__label__0 i did not have a backup battery , and had no need for one .
__label__0 not perfect ( yes , the viewfinder can get obstructed in instances.but the lcd works well enough in those instances ) , not the cheapest 4.0 mp , but the best 4.0 mp .
__label__1 get one now !
__label__0 if not i will avoid apex products in the future .
__label__1 be very careful when the battery is low and make sure to carry extra batteries .
__label__0 this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and downloaded then installed the updated driver .
__label__0 tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent .
__label__0 the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it .
__label__0 my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the cdds service , the ripping process fails to populate the  year  field .
__label__0 first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .
__label__0 p.s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ?
__label__0 the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .
__label__0 now where did i put that manual ?
__label__0 it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into .
__label__0 here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera :
__label__0 i was able to easily copy 2gb worth of video files from my computer , and then transfer them to a friend 's .
__label__0 this dvd play is basicly junk .
__label__0 before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there .
__label__0 otherwise it 'll get there the day you get back from the hospital !
__label__0 for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience .
__label__0 after spending hours being transferred from one tech help person to another , i got fed up and have decided to return the phone .
__label__0 mp3 players of this kind of memory are typically small and light and have between 64 mb - 1.5 gb of memory .
__label__0 the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable !
__label__0 ( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n't play and they were new ones !
__label__0 i can only hear the sound .
__label__0 this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler .
__label__0 though the instruction booklet says that the camera should display  lens  when the cap and the camera are both on , the camera lens extends out and simply takes the lens cap off by itself .
__label__0 i should say i have been very happy with my decision ever since .
__label__0 one thing i should note is that i have only had this product for one day , so there are many options i have not explored .
__label__0 reading other reviews , i do n't think the replacement one will be any better .
__label__0 i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally .
__label__0 all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved .
__label__0 this really is a great little phone ; its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny !
__label__0 it says i have a harddisk problem .
__label__0 as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand .
__label__0 so i contacted customer service at creative , but they said ,  if the product seems broken , we cannot help ,  or something to that effect .
__label__0 you just have to use the lcd viewfinder to see the whole picture .
__label__0 it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .
__label__0 i first intended to buy the 3100 , but am really happy to invest the extra money for the 4300 .
__label__0 a somewhat more troublesome problem is that the internet site will sometimes give different discs of the same set slightly different names .
__label__0 i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to manuver through the menus quickly .
__label__0 my last phone was a samsung s105 which imo is superior and cheaper to this phone .
__label__0 i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .
__label__0 very easy to use .
__label__0 the software has n't been a hassle for me at all .
__label__0 i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .
__label__0 sometimes when i get really lonely , i like to put on some kenny g and light some candles , and while this does n't help , i am a capitalist pig and like buying things too , nah mean ! ?
__label__0 my opinions :
__label__0 i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work .
__label__0 i have a dvd burner on my computer and a zillion mp3s , and it 's a lot nicer to access them 4.5 gb at a time ( dvd-r ) than 0.7 gb at a time ( cd-r ) !
__label__1 if you are going to need a player that is rugged this may not be the one for you .
__label__0 this is a great camera for you !
__label__0 the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate .
__label__0 ipod can be used as an external disk , and apparently stores files without problem .
__label__0 charged my battery .
__label__0 however , it did motivate me to find a work-around solution .
__label__0 the time taken in shifting from one menu option to other is in microseconds only .
__label__0 the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .
__label__0 the zen nx is $ 100 cheaper than the ipod of the same size , so you have to wonder just how much apple 's markup is anyway !
__label__0 what a disappointment !
__label__0 it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime .
__label__0 - the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily .
__label__0 i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it .
__label__0 i finally joined the 21st century and bought this dvd player .
__label__0 - the drawbacks were that they were not user friendly for the casual photographer , the lcd screen is a little too small , cp5000 does not take photos in raw format .
__label__0 the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this .
__label__0 now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it !
__label__0 these are minor problems , and i list them to save anyone else the trouble of discovering them .
__label__0 and have returned both .
__label__0 all of the zens use a standard notebook drive .
__label__0 all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player .
__label__1 you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .
__label__0 you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .
__label__0 the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .
__label__0 it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into .
__label__0 small size .
__label__1 from there , you transfer files from your computer to the mp3 player ( with the help of the media sniffer .. . read the manual ).
__label__0 nice machines , but i consider their quality pretty low now .
__label__0 while the ipod 's form factor is much nicer , here 's where the zen is better .
__label__1 although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .
__label__0 i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) .
__label__0 i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with  bass boost .
__label__0 the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use .
__label__0 most of our emplyees use this model phone .
__label__0 loved the slim design .
__label__0 apple 's solution - pay apple another $ 400 + for a new ipod ( less a paltry discount ) .
__label__0 but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera .
__label__0 ipod users have to send theirs back and pay $ 100 for a replacement .
__label__0 i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again .
__label__0 what else can you say about a camera that works for both of you ?
__label__0 ripping & transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1.1 usb ) .
__label__0 the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibles , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .
__label__0 no difference .
__label__0 the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue .
__label__0 it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .
__label__1 if you are buying a zen xtra check whether the battery recharges via usb ; it does not on the zen nx .
__label__0 naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recomend www.nomadness.net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable .
__label__0 there was no distortion and it sounded great , especially with eax environmental audio enabled .
__label__0 however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .
__label__0 3 ) user replaceable battery
__label__0 minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable .
__label__1 use the rechargeable because that saves you money and helps the environment in a long run .
__label__1 overall i think that you need to consider what you wan't to do .
__label__0 it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there .
__label__0 therefore im saying im returning it right now , and i will see wat happens with my next zen xtra ( same replacement ) .
__label__0 worked for two weeks .
__label__0 the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air .
__label__0 but the major problem i had was with the software .
__label__0 nothing but hassle with this company .
__label__0 sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features .
__label__0 the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so .
__label__0 i have it connected to speakers for a nice musical alarm in the morning .
__label__0 i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .
__label__0 the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .
__label__0 set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week .
__label__0 i had an olympus digital camera before and it was nothing compared to this .
__label__1 for those who have this metz flash ( or the 45cl-3 ) and would like to get the absolute ultimate quality out of this g3 , the metz module you need is the sca 3102 and the connector cord is the sca 3000c .
__label__0 4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .
__label__0 i became interested in getting a mp3 player when i got a new work computer ; while my office bars the addition of any non-work software , it does n't care if you load cds onto the hard drive .
__label__0 that 's my only real complaint about the nomad zen xtra , though .
__label__0 i am a software engineer and if i wrote an interface to my software that worked like this , there would be hell to pay , not to mention the ridicule from my peers .
__label__0 the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .
__label__0 once you start sending files , it 'll continue until it 's done or it hits a song that has the same title as another song ... at which point you can skip , skip all , replace , replace all , or cancel .
__label__0 the ipod uses a smaller ( and more expensive ) drive ( 1.8  ) .
__label__0 however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .
__label__0 i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) .
__label__0 i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected .
__label__0 it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up .
__label__0 my next thought was that the dvd must be damaged .
__label__0 also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27  tv ).
__label__1 if you are n't into paying $ x00 to learn and experiment , or the cons outweigh the pros , then wait a year or so .
__label__0 however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my divx rips .
__label__0 after doing a hands-on comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dsc-f 717 ( both of which lack the quality , feel , or features of the g3 ) , i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality ( resolution and coloration are superior ) .
__label__0 the description of the warranty is buried on the supplied set up cd .
__label__0 player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 .
__label__0 the picturers are amazing .
__label__0 i just used the explorer program to move my songs to my player .
__label__0 the volume level of the phone is not all that good .
__label__1 do not buy this product --
__label__0 i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year  no questions asked  replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous !
__label__0 it comes with a good case that fits it snuggly .
__label__1 if you really need to save , buy this thing on amazon , they eventually gave me a full refund .
__label__0 very simple to use .
__label__0 i want to have instant access to the volume , not have to hold down a button and have to wait a half second for the player to register it .
__label__0 it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack .
__label__0 the player 's mechanics are also flawed .
__label__0 additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. )
__label__0 i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar .
__label__0 the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! ) .
__label__1 you should consider this when deciding what bit rate you want to use and how much you want to put on the player .
__label__0 downloads are a snap and quick .
__label__0 people complain about the scroll wheel , but its not a big deal at all ( though it is just a little annoying at times ) .
__label__0 the downside is that you might accidentally take pictures with the lens cap on , the camera wo n't fit in the small cases , and 28mm filters are expensive and hard to find .
__label__0 now what about the flash problem ?
__label__0 usually i just skip to the next chapter to avoid it .
__label__0 so if you use your card reader ; copy images - you got to once again open them through their software to put the date ; time .
__label__0 my sister has this series of phone and she loves the radio and headset .
__label__0 the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .
__label__0 the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player .
__label__1 you can use this camera right out of the box on the automatic setting , or slowly get comfortable with the manual settings and what they can do .
__label__1 if you want , check out the canon website and they have some sample images , taken by this camera , for you to download .
__label__1 as i said , this is the last digital camera i 'll buy , and if you are in the market one , my advice is to buy the best thing you can afford and keep it forever .
__label__0 the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc.
__label__0 2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre , artist , album , etc. ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information .
__label__0 recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .
__label__0 the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .
__label__0 i cant do anything about it , and i have to send back .
__label__0 on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .
__label__0 i 'm concerned that with the easily removed lens cap , i may damage the lens .
__label__0 the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly .
__label__0 i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .
__label__0 - great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price
__label__0 while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .
__label__0 had it for a week .
__label__0 the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n't even notice the click .
__label__0 for me , that was the only drawback .
__label__0 making the step from film to digital has been a great move .
__label__1 but for someone who cares about thier music collection and wants fluid and responsive playback .. . i can 't recommend this product .
__label__0 canon was an obvious choice , but i did not want to limit my decision , so started researching all brands that would take my microdrives .
__label__0 even if it has n't expired , creative is likely to claim that the owner caused the damage which in turn voids the warranty .
__label__0 11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player
__label__0 a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .
__label__0 the software , which comes with player is not good at all .
__label__1 this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .
__label__0 wo n't play a lot of discs .
__label__0 in fact , my boyfriend is now going to invest into one of these suckers as well ... now he realizes that this is the best choice over his current archos and the ipod he was eyeing .
__label__0 ok , im writing yet another review , about a week from my previous one .
__label__0 some of the great gains over g2 --
__label__0 so far i 've played regular dvd 's , backup dvd-r 's , mp3 cd 's , and regular cd 's .
__label__0 the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots .
__label__0 well , maybe that particular song was just corrupt , so i tried to upload some of my own , after four attempts , at each one the unit locked up and required a reboot , i managed to upload an album , which albeit was surprisingly fast , however when attempting to create a playlist out of my newly uploaded songs , the nomad again froze up and refused to work .
__label__0 and with usb 2.0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .
__label__1 you can cut up the case a bit with an xacto knife and make it useable though .
__label__0 received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector .
__label__0 you see , i can 't rank the product since the merchant that amazon is collaborating with ( j and r camera . ) to bring us consumers better choices never sent me the product .
__label__0 so i took it back to best buy where i bought it and exchanged it for a newer zen 20 gig model .
__label__1 do n't buy this player .
__label__0 no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic 's for just a couple of keepers .
__label__0 a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )
__label__0 the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .
__label__0 so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine .
__label__0 - you just have to buy a new player .
__label__0 based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal .
__label__0 i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .
__label__1 100 % perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos .
__label__0 i thought the software was decent enough - it was n't complicated to learn at all .
__label__0 seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) .
__label__0 an extra rechargeable en-el 1 battery is also handy , so you will seldom run into  out of battery  situation .
__label__0 1 . i had initially thought of buying a 2 or 3 megapixel camera but these are good for 4x6  or 5x7  prints and i wanted some really great 8x10  photos once in a while .
__label__0 it 's no problem for me personally .
__label__0 they are not wowable good .
__label__0 we tried it out christmas night and it worked great .
__label__0 2 . i do n't need the nomad at home for the same reason ( although using it to sync between the two pc 's might be a reason enough to get it . )
__label__0 retraction : said mine had silver plate : it does have display .
__label__0 the most important thing for me is sound quality .
__label__0 this problem vanished after the first month , so i assume it was a temporary dust issue .
__label__0 also the ipod has games on it .
__label__0 i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .
__label__0 it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera ..
__label__0 it actually gives the option to clear the previous playlist when i want to play another list .
__label__0 after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( fkor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them.the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support .
__label__0 yes , i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay .
__label__1 however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .
__label__0 this is my first digital camera .
__label__0 most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy .
__label__0 this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve .
__label__0 interface - practically seamless .
__label__0 no contact phone number , only eamil contact which did not respond me .
__label__0 if something were to happen to my nikon coolpix 4300 , i would order another just like it .
__label__0 we ordered two apex ad-2600 's for our family for christmas - finally decided to join the rest of the world and watch dvd 's - well .
__label__0 great screen and great sound .
__label__0 i am a software engineer and am very keen into technical details of everything i buy , i spend around 3 months before buying the digital camera ; and i must say , g3 worth every single cent i spent on it .
__label__0 up , down , left , and right would have given me better control .
__label__0 the cd will be classified into a number of genres , and in multidisk sets , you can get separate classifications for different disks by the same artist and the same performance .
__label__1 spend the extra 20 $ and buy a name brand dvd player .
__label__0 another stupid move .
__label__0 cleaned the dvd , tried again , no luck .
__label__0 i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .
__label__0 the mini ipod 's look the best to me -- but with only 4gb there 's no way i would ever buy any mp3 player with a measly 4gb of storage .
__label__0 i called nokia tech support and they blamed microsoft .
__label__0 i bought this for my dad for christmas .
__label__0 it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .
__label__0 this bumpy is wicked groovy .
__label__0 the only complaint seems to be that the disk rotation is slow , leading to longer delays in some functions ( playback and even a slow display of the menu ? ) .
__label__0 my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units .
__label__0 the picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv .
__label__0 compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use .
__label__0 the downside though , may be a big one for you .
__label__0 b. fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2.4 ghz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .
__label__0 the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on .
__label__0 that 's been my experience .
__label__0 it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player !
__label__0 the dvd player just would't recognize them .
__label__0 the other thing i do n't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated .
__label__0 third party software to the rescue
__label__0 a short range fm transmitter would be much nicer .
__label__0 i would be nice to have a simple fm receiver so i could pick up local stations .
__label__0 the software was great , as long as you have an adminstrative user account ( windows xp ) .
__label__0 having my entire music collection is great when travelling ( both on plane and car trips ) and i do n't have to decide what to bring or copy onto the player -- it 's all there .
__label__0 i had hoped this was bought from walmart so that i could return it !
__label__0 the remote is a little hard to understand .
__label__0 the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily .
__label__0 it 's just easier for me since i can make on the fly adjustments .
__label__0 i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .
__label__0 3 battery has to be removed to recharge .
__label__0 i originally purchase a 30 gb nomad zen xtra as a portable mp3 player .
__label__0 it is less versatile , but i am never disappointed with the output .
__label__0 i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine .
__label__0 you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division .
__label__0 this will cause the discs not to show up together when you are looking for them on the nomad .
__label__0 ( my orignal review is below : )
__label__0 the mediasource itself was flaky ... crashing my explorer twice within the first hour ( the crash did n't require a reboot ) ... but after another reboot , it has n't crashed since .
__label__0 as some other reviewers noted , after it was connected to the computer for a bit , it somehow stopped reading the player so i had to replug it .
__label__0 for ipod you have to buy a cable and it is n't compatible with all windows pcs.
__label__0 in other words , to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist , you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it .
__label__0 after @ 3 months , it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds .
__label__0 this is one of those items that , at first glance , looked cool but did n't really ring a bell with me .
__label__0 surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available .
__label__0 creative provided e-mail support ;
__label__0 some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .
__label__0 after having bought and been disappointed in another brand of dvd player , i purchased the apex ad2600 from amazon and first of all i should say it was delivered much more quickly than i had expected .
__label__0 i will just say this :
__label__0 in music tones department the 6610 has 20 chords ( thats number of different instruments which it can play ) i think , the samsung i think have 15 , i donno about the other phones but i feel the t610 has the best sounding ring tones .
__label__0 advanced photobugs will find more creative control than imaginable .
__label__0 i only have one question , when i add tracks to my nomad , via nomad explorer , they are automatically put in alphebetical order , rather than album order .
__label__0 this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .
__label__0 the speakerphone :
__label__0 navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .
__label__0 only thing missing from creative is a cd burner .
__label__0 it 's a winner .
__label__0 the player : it 's silver .
__label__0 when will my t-zones work ?  , csr :
__label__1 buy the re-seller 's extended warranty and save yourself a headache for the problems you will have later , after all it is a hard drive and it will die or have issues over time ( probably sooner than later ) .
__label__0 the reason for this the ipod has  a better user interface  .
__label__0 you can customize bass , etc. like usual , but also you can customize the sound of the player ( like how it would sound in a concert hall , jazz club , etc ).
__label__0 the reason so many is that i am a contractor and all of my subs have these carriers and i can benifit from the mobile to mobile features that companies are now offering !
__label__0 i decided to check one more thing though and plugged in my 3-year - old unit again just to see .
__label__0 i personally am not crazy about the looks of either the ipod or the nomad .
__label__0 i 've been using it for about 3 months now .
__label__0 the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd .
__label__0 how does it sound ?
__label__0 so it was no loss .
__label__0 but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability .
__label__0 i do n't think so .
__label__0 it 's nothing major , just a bad hard drive , any hard drive mp3 player can have that problem .
__label__1 well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .
__label__0 most of the dvds i was trying were fairly new and were in great condition .
__label__0 very cheaply made .
__label__1 i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n't take weeks to figure out how to operate .
__label__0 it took several days of attempts before things finally  worked  again and i have n't a clue why .
__label__0 this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .
__label__0 construction quality is a difficult item .
__label__0 having usb 2.0 makes for very fast transfers .
__label__0 all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n't done it since .
__label__0 i guess that 's why you so often see  ipodders  bashing every other player out there ( very often not knowing anything about them the whole  i spent $ 120 more for something not any better and so should you ... so i can feel better  thing .
__label__0 3 ) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software .
__label__0 my sister was able to figure it out on her own as well , and she is of average computer competence .
__label__0 zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery .
__label__0 lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .
__label__0 after about a minute of trying to tell me that most people use the lcd and not the view finder , they finally admitted , it was a design flaw in the camera .
__label__0 i love the pros and cons reviews so here ya go :
__label__0 i received the apex ad-2600 before i expected .
__label__0 after i reviewed the manual ( a pdf file included on the cd ) , i felt better because they warned you about the message and said it would n't cause problems and , in fact , it has n't .
__label__0 it was not my first choice .
__label__0 this camera performs like i can not believe !
__label__0 it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .
__label__0 the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .
__label__0 i am extremely satisfied with this camera .
__label__0 the olympus is a bit clumsy-looking and the user-interface not as friendly as the canon , but one of the features that sold me on the g3 was the battery life - no other camera out there gives you the type of battery life as the canon g3 .
__label__0 it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation .
__label__0 even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them .
__label__0 contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .
__label__0 however , it serves its purpose .
__label__0 - uploading music is quick and easy .
__label__0 i purchased this phone for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it .
__label__0 service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great .
__label__0 but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .
__label__0 apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .
__label__0 this does n't affect the picture , of course .
__label__0 i found this to be a much easier method of transferring my music to the nomad than using their software .
__label__0 and i am hoping the static i heard when using eax was a blip ...
__label__0 transfer files is easy using notmad , however again , would be great if nomad supported folders like iriver , rca lyra and some other .
__label__0 but this camera is great !
__label__0 negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .
__label__0 - the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage .
__label__0 originally i wanted the ipod .
__label__0 the prior one looked and felt lightweight , cheesy , and assembled by the oppressed :
__label__0 it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !
__label__0 amazon , do your customers a big favor , do n't carry this item , and give them refunds !
__label__0 i will never buy a creative product again .
__label__0 m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !
__label__0 it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .
__label__0 here are the shortcomings i have noticed so far :
__label__0 slowly yet surely my unit engorged as i read my own review , similar to when i look in the mirror .
__label__0 it 's a dedicated music playing device , anyway , so this serves it better .
__label__0 - price : see above .
__label__0 the phones are awesome .
__label__0 -- > does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library .
__label__0 the dvd played without flaw through the chapter in question .
__label__0 also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display .
__label__0 me , i am going with a leica minilux ( the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen ) .
__label__0 when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n't there :
__label__0 here 's a basic run-down from what i learned :
__label__0 at best , i 've gotten 3 hours + .
__label__0 oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^
__label__0 the player itself has all sorts of problems .
__label__0 apex 's website is down and they wo n't answer their phone .
__label__0 the sound quality of my cd player is superior in this setting to the nomad .
__label__0 subsequent behavior even worse .
__label__0 i 'm considering using mine as a distraction to winter boredom in the paintball fields .
__label__0 after two weeks the picture kept freezing .
__label__0 i 'll probably also get the wide-angle now , too .
__label__1 get cheaper panasonics or toshibas or even sonys .
__label__0 so i was all excited about the ipod but then the day before i went to best buy to check out the other mp3 players and i came across this one .
__label__0 and does n't need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does .
__label__0 i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar .
__label__0 it beats the competition in almost every area including battery life , enthusiast features , external flash capabilities , available storage types , image formats , and more .
__label__0 his i-pod can only play for a couple of hours with a fully recharging now .
__label__0 from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to .
__label__0 you wo n't appreciate the quality this thing has to offer unless you are using a good set of cans.
__label__0 the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .
__label__0 this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .
__label__0 the appearance is okayed ( at least not ugly ) .
__label__0 i bought a 512 mb card , which seems to hold about 400 photos at the highest resolution .
__label__0 the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good .
__label__0 what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software .
__label__0 i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift .
__label__0 most people say buy an ipod , but they are pretty expensive and also require you to send the product back to the factory just to replace the battery .
__label__0 there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .
__label__0 i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker .
__label__0 it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar .
__label__0 third , the poor design continues with the case .
__label__0 i have had this phone for about 5 months .
__label__0 people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i 'm even using a speakerphone .
__label__0 if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .
__label__0 it does n't do you any good if a camera has all the features but you can 't access them quickly when you need them !
__label__0 with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .
__label__0 i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either .
__label__1 buy this camera , you wo n't regret it .
__label__0 it 's going back today , &#38; being replaced with the new samsung x105 .
__label__1 before jumping on the ipod train , take a look at this marvel .
__label__0 i wound up buying a gray card and use it all the time with the custom white-balance setting .
__label__0 anyway , in the store , i tried coolpix 4300 along with two other 4mp models minolta dimage s414 , and panasonic lumix .
__label__0 if you have any multi-disc box sets , you 'll notice that the artist 's name , album name , and genre will often change with every disc .
__label__0 maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing .
__label__1 all the products have drawbacks and are not mature yet ; if you expect value and reliability then wait a while .
__label__0 the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .
__label__0 2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it .
__label__0 a lot of research went into digital camera 's before i made this purchase , and hands down , the g3 had everything i needed plus more .
__label__0 although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint .
__label__0 a $ 300 device and they skimped on the headphone jack ?
__label__0 in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software
__label__0 fact is , it could n't be easier to use .
__label__0 i purchased the extended warranty ( something i almost never do ) when i returned the unit to get the replacement .
__label__0 it also lets you remove songs from the play order .
__label__0 with the automatic settings , i really have n't taken a bad picture yet .
__label__0 however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experince mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .
__label__0 canon 's g3 does it consistently .
__label__0 my fiance just did n't like the way it felt in her hands .
__label__0 i transfered all 16 gigs in 15 minutes without any errors via firewire .
__label__0 i felt that i should write this comment asap , as i am quite excited in using its features .
__label__0 this is great as long as all of your music have id3 tags , and if you 've downloaded your songs off the internet , many probably do n't .
__label__0 the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n't load on some computers .
__label__0 you do n't have this problem if you make your playlist from the nomad , where cds are listed separately .
__label__0 ripping the songs , even with my 1.1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .
__label__0 which was a good thing , because i realized i had forgotten my phone ...
__label__1 take my words and give it a try .
__label__0 apple 's ipod is dominant now , but i have to wonder whether the price differential will mean that in 3 or 4 years its market share will drop significantly .
__label__0 thankfully amazon has free return shipping !
__label__0 in manual , you can set it to  single af  where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features .
__label__0 the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .
__label__0 i realize this is for quality assurance purposes , but i should have the right to say when my questions have not been answered ( i.e. me :
__label__0 the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .
__label__0 the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal .
__label__0 the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .
__label__0 think you need to pay a fortune for a good qulaity dvd player ?
__label__0 i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .
__label__0 granted it is a little more than the zen , it is well worth it .
__label__0 my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .
__label__0 reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
__label__0 creative also sells batteries via its website , so there 's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery .
__label__1 if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you .
__label__0 not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy .
__label__0 audio is excellent .
__label__0 great sound ; good interface ; replaceable , powerful battery ; good software ; wake-up , sleep timers ; multiple play modes
__label__0 i 've got 1200 songs on it now and about 4000 more to go .
__label__0 i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .
__label__1 the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it .
__label__0 when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n't moving , the photos were awesome .
__label__0 i was limited to 999 files in a playlist with archos ' os , now i can have as many as i want .
__label__0 in addition , you can create play lists where you can create the equivalent to a compilation cd right on your player .
__label__0 i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there .
__label__0 this model has come down in price since i purchased mine .
__label__0 this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it .
__label__0 mediasource did not recognize my tags !
__label__0 this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38; very convenient to scroll in menu etc .
__label__0 this product is too fragile for normal use .
__label__0 for `` cool factor '' buffs it looks and feels like a small plastic brick brick and does n't have any wow factor .
__label__0 if you can live without an integrated camera , you wo n't miss much more .
__label__0 the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with .
__label__0 hope i helped !
__label__0 the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .
__label__0 i simply love this feature .
__label__0 the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n't take up space on your pc hard drive .
__label__0 also , it was only $ 39.99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player .
__label__0 * removable battery
__label__0 the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .
__label__0 at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available .
__label__0 the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily .
__label__0 i was in search of a new item to take it 's place as my new mp3 player / harddrive .
__label__0 first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .
__label__0 while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets .
__label__0 it seems to be working fine , but we 've not used it all that much .
__label__0 and i read today that you can also have online fill out the id3 , so its not a problem .
__label__0 overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .
__label__0 all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .
__label__0 it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something .
__label__0 now honestly , i love this player , but with all seriousness , i would not recommend it to other people , because of the breakdown flaw. and i honestly would not recomment the people of the ipod , that crap sucks big donkey ..... never mind .
__label__0 had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches .
__label__0 it did not lock up my computer or require a reboot .
__label__0 it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .
__label__0 i am new to the whole digital camera thing ; well , new to the whole camera thing period , really .
__label__0 i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's , after the frustration and aggrivation of getting the player to do it 's job .
__label__0 i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc .
__label__0 do not recommend .
__label__0 the other cameras were great and i 'm sure many people will beg to differ from my observations , but to each his / her own .
__label__0 4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .
__label__0 seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .
__label__0 maybe i 'll get lucky with the next one .
__label__0 i was told that it is no longer available , so there must be something really wrong with it .
__label__0 it 's worth it .
__label__0 hopefully you wo n't regret .
__label__1 unless you are making posters , a g3 is more than good enough .
__label__0 i got the 40gb jukebox zen xtra for christmas .
__label__0 ( did i mention you can actually change the battery ? hello ? apple ? are you listening ? )
__label__0 while you can create a temporary playlist , you can 't store it permanently , delete songs , search very easily , etc.
__label__0 ( 1 gb = 1,000 mb )
__label__0 i 've tried draining it until it wo n't turn on & recharging it overnight .
__label__1 i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name .
__label__0 i ended up sending the unit back to amazon .
__label__0 for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised .
__label__1 consider the time you save during picture taking especially not missing a good moment and during download , it 's well worth the little extra money .
__label__0 you have to add them to the playing list .
__label__0 was i just unlucky at that moment ?
__label__0 it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy .
__label__0 simply not as friendly for functional as an ipod .
__label__0 i searched on the internet and found one tip which solved our problem : press i/p button on the remote control .
__label__0 the 6610 is still easier to use than the other two phones ( t610 , t720i ) .
__label__1 do not buy this product or any apex product unless you are looking to be frustrated and lose money !
__label__0 3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players
__label__0 it is an extremely cool gizmo .
__label__0 also , when i installed the software , it said that windows xp had n't approved something with the drivers , etc - and that continuing it install may cause instability .
__label__0 there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .
__label__0 i received this as a gift .
__label__0 i purchased the nikon 4300 after several weeks of searching .
__label__0 and then it breaks .
__label__0 the built-in camera they offer these days is more of kids stuff .
__label__0 the top of the player is a thin metal piece that covers up the battery and is removable .
__label__0 on the subject of headphones , this thing seems like a normal mp3 player when you use the headphones they give you in the box , but invest 30 dollars in a nice pair and the sound quality goes up through the roof !
__label__0 one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .
__label__0 - the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .
__label__0 the scroll wheel is finicky ; it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .
__label__1 this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it !
__label__0 the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out .
__label__0 i spent $ 269 for my 30gb zx , compared to the $ 299 for a 10gb ipod and the also expensive iriver ihp-120 .
__label__0 i do n't think i will ever use the full 30gb .
__label__0 more downside to this phone ?the volume .
__label__0 i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( los angeles ) is horrendous .
__label__0 my room is so dark and when i tried taking pics of it with my old camera , they came out black , but with this , they look the same in the picture as in real life .
__label__0 i could n't load more than one song before the software crashed .
__label__0 will never purchase apex again .
__label__0 bummer as it has great sound quality .
__label__0 but for what i do use it is perfect .
__label__0 i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ;
__label__0 the battery life is amazing .
__label__0 the little digital elphs were the best-designed , most-elegant cameras until the g3 came along and squashed them .
__label__0 i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera .
__label__0 had to buy my dad a different dvd player locally ( panasonic ) which worked just fine .
__label__0 i bought this as a gift for my sister .
__label__0 oh and before anyone comments yes i know motorola have announced a quad band edge bluetooth phone , but its not shipping at time of writing and the tri-band gsm850 phones lack the gsm900 band which is important if you like me globally roam .
__label__0 granted , i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas , but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player .
__label__0 that would be a nice compromise between jpeg and raw .
__label__0 the nomad is sent back to creative labs .
__label__0 well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .
__label__0 the ipod is a one way only machine - from computer to player .
__label__0 look / design :
__label__0 i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .
__label__0 and so i must ask , what are cameras for ?
__label__0 software downloads on the site crashed my pc .
__label__0 boy was i wrong .
__label__1 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .
__label__0 you will be told goldstar codes work , and you will be told zenith codes will work , and radio shack will give you apex codes but they will not work .
__label__0 battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive
__label__1 the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .
__label__0 i would have given a 3 to 5 star review in my first few weeks , depending on how mad i felt about the crummy software .
__label__0 remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons .
__label__0 30gb is more than enough for most people .
__label__0 sold in other parts of the world :
__label__0 the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject .
__label__0 the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .
__label__0 we saw reviews that said the same thing , and also saw here that their customer service stinks .
__label__1 but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .
__label__0 i 'd always eyed the nokia phones and had heard decent things about t-mobile , so i gave it a whirl .
__label__0 after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .
__label__1 i would recommend this player to anyone i know , and you will not be dissapointed .
__label__0 i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .
__label__0 one word of caution with regards to using the nomad with itunes .
__label__0 80 % of the features on here you will not get by spending $ 100 on a sony or panasonic .
__label__0 how did this gigantic flaw go unnoticed by creative ?
__label__0 especially useful with portraits and difficult-to-meter situations .
__label__0 lot 's of other features that i need to find out about .
__label__0 nice camera but does n't take as sharp as pictures i thought they would , and again .
__label__0 i was getting so sick of my old motorola l7089 , but was waiting for the right phone to come along .
__label__0 after much frustration ( above ) i found the notmad explorer ; cute product name for software that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer & organization problems .
__label__0 every t-mobile plan comes with gsm data , meaning that instead of speeds of 56 kbps is around 9 kbps ( with those small size wap websites do you really think it makes a difference ) .
__label__0 technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! !
__label__0 like other reviewers , installation was hell .
__label__0 i got my camera three days back , and although i had some experience with digital cameras prior to purchasing this one , i still rate myself as a beginner .
__label__0 the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .
__label__0 i did already have mediasource installed due to owning the creative audigy 2 soundcard but i did need to re-install it from the supplied cd as the older version did not have the connector to the zen .
__label__0 if you 're copying cds with windows media , its really simple to give your songs id3 tags , so thats what i do .
__label__0 it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .
__label__0 it really does n't make any cents $ $ to build a great reputation then destroy it from lack a research and testing in one season .
__label__0 all in all suprisingly easy to use .
__label__0 a little weighty ( 9 ounces ... no biggie ) , but otherwise fine .
__label__0 had no problem with it .
__label__0 the t610 can also compose music , a feature which most wo n't use .
__label__0 after investigating a multitude of player options , i asked for and received the 60 gb zen xtra for christmas .
__label__0 first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds .
__label__0 print those coupons twice for two phones ?
__label__0 and those songs mostly are 320 kbps.
__label__0 the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )
__label__0 you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .
__label__0 some things that i did n't like ( but hey . nothing is perfect ).
__label__0 anyways , canon has improved upon the g2 with this g3 .
__label__0 i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .
__label__0 i 'll admit that i 'd own an ipod if i had money to burn , but for the money this is a much better buy .
__label__0 it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly .
__label__1 do n't walk , run and buy this camera if you have the budget , i guarantee you will not be disappointed .
__label__0 the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now .
__label__0 another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying .
__label__0 if creative offered a 12-month warranty on their mp3 players , i 'd be covered .
__label__0 there have also been times that the unit has been turned off for some period of time , upon powering it up it starts on the  now playing  screen with a song or cd that i had been playing days before .
__label__0 for work , we use them in the field often , and they hold up really well .
__label__1 if you can get this phone for cingular or at&t , go with the other carriers .
__label__0 the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual .
__label__0 what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .
__label__0 a minor quibble , since most cameras on the market still only include the 8mb cards .
__label__0 bottom line ... great product , unbeatable price .
__label__0 if you are skeptical about trying apex .
__label__0 i did buy the telephoto lens ( and the required extension ) .
__label__0 the dial on the original zen was perfect and i wish it was on this model .
__label__0 that is , if a folder on your computer called  mp3  has slayer ( thrash metal ) , stravinsky ( classical ) , and ice cube ( rap ) in it , you will only be able to play the contents of that folder by searching for the artists or genres manually .
__label__0 i would much more have preferred a keypad-type navigator like found on dvd remotes .
__label__1 do not underestimate this in your purchase decision .
__label__0 i have had this player for 2 weeks , i will be returning it for an exchange in the hopes that the locking problem and scroll wheel are problems with this particular unit .
__label__0 the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb .
__label__1 buy it for fun , for lack of processing , because you want to use iphoto , or whatever .
__label__0 took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
__label__0 i call apex customer service and they told me that there is a known problem with the model playing disney and other movies and that it is not there problem so i 'm stuck with a new dvd player that wo n't play my kids disney movies .
__label__0 you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .
__label__0 again , though , it has only been used sparingly .
__label__0 i can imagine that they 'd fill up my ibook 's internal memory pretty quickly .
__label__0 compared to other leading hdd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops .
__label__0 a. the cddb downloads information for the cd that you insert such that you do not have to type in the track information such as album , artist , song title , etc.
__label__0 i have an apex ad600 for a few years now which still works great today .
__label__0 hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations .
__label__0 i initially loaded about 3700 tracks with the intent of ripping the majority of my remaining cds to mp3 .
__label__1 the workaround is to update id3 tags on your files ( through mediasource ) but it can be a hassle if you have many such music files .
__label__0 it referred to a  microsoft jet database engine  error and the install program suggested i download a service pack from the ms website to fix the problem ;
__label__0 c. i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer .
__label__0 it is not perfect though .
__label__0 the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons .
__label__0 the warranty is 90 days .
__label__0 the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n't played with it too much on manual .
__label__0 the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .
__label__0 another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it .
__label__0 but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture .
__label__0 i wish i could give negative stars !
__label__0 i just put it on  shuffle  , sit back , and enjoy the eclectic mix that almost 3,000 tunes offer !
__label__1 my only suggestion is to get a lens protector to help protect the shooting lens ( the lens coating will wear out after so many clean wipes ) and i 'm getting the those ( 52 mm adapter and uv lens filter ) at lensmateonline.com .
__label__0 5 for  digital film  it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome .
__label__0 come on, at $ 300 they could at least put in a good pair of earphones .
__label__0 i purchased this as a christmas gift for my husband .
__label__0 ability to play most discs - i tried dvd , vcd , dvd-r , audio cd and it played all
__label__0 the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train .
__label__0 basically wat happened , is that the hard drive failed .
__label__0 the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap .
__label__0 nokia will not cover phones bought from amazon .
__label__0 i would have liked to be able to see what is playing without having to open the case .
__label__0 once i get focus lock , i can then wait until my restless subject ( a pet or a child ) strikes an amusing pose and then fire the shutter with some reasonable probability of getting my subject still in focus .
__label__0 this gap allowed the front panel to fly off after barely being touched .
__label__0 i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .
__label__1 using the gprs option you can pay 19.99 extra a month and have unlimited internet access added to you account .
__label__0 sure it 's  old school  to carry a cd wallet around , but it will be easier to manage and i 'll save around 250 bucks .
__label__0 i hate apex but love amazon , and i tell everyone .
__label__0 the movie mode is also working great .
__label__0 and should they not know it , they can find it out pretty quick .
__label__0 i 've bought the very expensive sanyo 5500/vm4500 -- which i love -- and i 'm okay with my services .
__label__0 i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media .
__label__0 1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want .
__label__0 i particularly like the  txt  file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take.
__label__0 but after 10 days , the sound worked , but the video quit working .
__label__0 like most people , i do n't want to read the instructions , i just want to use it .
__label__0 nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com
__label__0 hard drives ( this is what most ipods have - and just about all mp3 players over 3-5 gb of memory ) .
__label__0 the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .
__label__0 the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .
__label__0 it does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves .
__label__0 the first one was the 705 which i hacked successfully to play all region dvds and disable macrovision .
__label__0 but who wants the wires involved .
__label__0 3/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze .
__label__0 it looks great - and is loaded with features .
__label__0 the software and design are geared towards enhancing the music experience .
__label__0 i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .
__label__0 the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful  scene  mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless .
__label__0 i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy .
__label__0 that said this phone does what it does extremely well - way better than anything motorola can produce .
__label__0 if problem occurs again i will repost my new rating .
__label__0 i 'll just say this .. .
__label__0 i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all .
__label__0 is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel .
__label__1 i would recommend buying one .
__label__0 if you happen to push the wrong button , you can wipe out the order of songs you had put in .
__label__0 poor visibility on the keys .
__label__0 i have returned the g3 ( actually i tried two of them ) and have my g2 !
__label__0 at this time , i decided to turn the player on , and much to my surprise it comes with quite the little library of classical music , one of which is a childhood favorite , bach 's air .
__label__0 the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack .
__label__0 two days later the phone was returned to me in complete working order .
__label__0 very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .
__label__0 i was so excited about the price and reviews of this dvd player .
__label__0 4 ) it did play my jpeg photos but wow , trying to figure it out was really something !
__label__0 it using something called ac3 ( at least the trial song i purchased was in this format ) which is not a compatible format for the nomad .
__label__0 and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?
__label__0 it 's almost like having a media player / file manager built into the dvd player .
__label__0 because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .
__label__0 despite the instructions insisting that the process was fairly automatic , i had to install the usb drivers and the nomad interface software manually .
__label__0 once i got home with it i had to first install creative mediasource and figure out how it transferred files to the player .
__label__0 anyway , i ended up purchasing the lumix .
__label__0 but i would expect that , since my movie discs have all played with no problem , the extras discs would , too , without any additional tweaking .
__label__0 this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) .
__label__0 -- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ).
__label__0 the only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode .
__label__0 i can replace that if the scratch is unbearable to look at .
__label__0 2 ) fm transmitter - so you can place the unit in your car and listen to the unit through your car stereo .
__label__0 i bought an ipod and am very happy with it .
__label__0 and since i 'm out here i can 't mail it back under my 90 days and they wo n't help me out cause they say that the conditions here are not covered under the warranty .
__label__0 it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light .
__label__1 3 ) you must press the play button and hold it for a couple of seconds otherwise it will not work and you will think the whole unit is broken .
__label__0 the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat. clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .
__label__0 the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings .
__label__0 i love this camera .
__label__0 cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .
__label__0 the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone  unlike the nokia 3650  and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make ...
__label__0 i am returning it , and again in the market for a multiformat dvd , svcd , vcd , mp3 , etc. player .
__label__0 they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .
__label__0 i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase !
__label__0 like many reviewers , i really wanted to like this product .
__label__0 fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the metz 60 ct-4 .
__label__0 crop and enlarge the best at practically no extra cost or time .
__label__0 huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you .
__label__0 i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use .
__label__0 this thing is trash .
__label__0 a sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included .
__label__0 i just bought the camera a few days ago .
__label__1 try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems .
__label__0 you will be sorry if you do .
__label__0 some of the more geeky ( non-apple type ) reviewers complain that the scrollwheel is annoying after a while and they resent being forced into this apple-like interface .
__label__0 i 'd like a camera phone , but i 'd rather have a phone than a toy that takes pictures but makes no calls ...
__label__0 just be aware of it .
__label__0 the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price .
__label__0 so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost .
__label__0 my choices at that moment were to manually re-tag my music or re-rip using mediasource .
__label__0 i bought this dvd player in november .
__label__0 there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful .
__label__0 olympus c5050 is a very solid camera with a metal body .
__label__0 creative tech support operators work 9-6 p.m. weekdays - as if i had time during work hours to spend time on this .
__label__0 forget the fact that it 'll probably take me a year to figure out all the features this camera has to offer .
__label__0 personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice .
__label__0 needless to say , the canon won , hands down .
__label__0 the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .
__label__0 we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken .
__label__0 was it a full moon that night ?
__label__0 review of zen xtra - 40 gb
__label__0 it is a very amazing product .
__label__0 the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again .
__label__0 i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box .
__label__0 the flap completely covers the screen because there is no window to see it .
__label__0 i think a $ 39 dissapointment is better then a $ 125 dissapointment !
__label__0 i was planning on getting an ipod , but i changed my mind last minute ... mostly because of the whole battery issue , i do n't have the patience for those sorta things .
__label__0 other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .
__label__0 i was prepared to love it .
__label__1 go get it .
__label__0 in the coastal redwood forests i was able to use these additional features along with the macro-focussing option to shoot wonderful close-up photos of the trilliums and other flowers in bloom .
__label__1 as its 4mp , you might need bigger storage to store high quality images and recording movies ( you can record 3 minutes of video ) .
__label__0 touchups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct .
__label__1 i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .
__label__0 the only downside i see is that it does n't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer .
__label__0 the price compared to the ipod is great .
__label__0 . if you want to have the date ; time on the image , its only through their software  nikon view  which reads the images date ; time from the images meta-data .
__label__0 mixed bag i guess but the price was right .
__label__0 i did extensive research comparing different 4 and 5 megapixel cameras .
__label__1 connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra !
__label__0 it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .
__label__0 but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in  auto  mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it !
__label__0 i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it .
__label__1 yes , i recommend it over the competition .
__label__0 i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable .
__label__0 24 hours ? by what time standards -- martian ?
__label__0 other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2.5 mm headset jack .
__label__0 now my little 6610 is the most coveted item at school !
__label__0 before they are sold out !
__label__0 ( to be fair , the same can be said about many korean imports , and the nokia 's build quality is light years ahead of the koreans . )
__label__0 if i could give this a negative rating , i would .
__label__0 another plus in my book , no file limits !
__label__0 the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint .
__label__0 this player is an ideal purchase .
__label__0 the button was probably accidentally pushed to cause the black screen in the first place .
__label__0 i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price .
__label__0 i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for .
__label__0 i bought this product from amazon .
__label__0 this is the 4 apex player that i have bought .
__label__0 yup , right back for a refund !
__label__0 i upgraded to a 6610 at my local t-mobile store .
__label__0 the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .
__label__0 wish it were a flip phone , but thats not a deal breaker !
__label__0 excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .
__label__0 it was always after it finished a process or something , so it did n't cause any file errors .
__label__0 for most people , they can carry around all or almost all of their music collection .
__label__0 all i am looking for is a rebate form !
__label__0 it will not load any further songs on and customer service has no idea what to do .
__label__0 the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me .
__label__0 no complaints there .
__label__0 the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks .
__label__0 i wanted to use the nomad with a cassette style car adapter .
__label__0 i love this player .
__label__0 it did lock up on me a couple of times .
__label__0 i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still can 't get a video signal from the machine .
__label__1 do n't get fooled by the 5 megapixel marketing hype .
__label__1 you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck
__label__0 thumbs down on that one .
__label__0 there have been other occurrences of locking , but i will not bore you with the details .
__label__0 the trouble shooting section in the user 's manual , suggesting correct and secure connections , does n't help .
__label__0 very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera .
__label__0 it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .
__label__0 not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have .
__label__1 i highly recommend the accessory kit , which provides you with everything else you need :
__label__0 sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .
__label__1 save your cash - go for a brand that actually cares about their reputation .
__label__0 - equipment included is average , but that is n't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .
__label__0 the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .
__label__0 you can easily access ur files , and easily fill in the id3 tags , which can take a while with a big collection of music , but if your not lazy , you will do it without a problem .
__label__0 i waited a few years between phones , mostly because ( like most i think ) i didnt really need one .
__label__0 maybe creative will come out with a better design , although it will be hard for me and its other customers to trust it again .
__label__0 all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .
__label__0 over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level !
__label__0 this puts the zen in line with players like the rca jukebox and the whole line of archos players ( the newer ones are a bit better than the original archos jukeboxes ... but i popped out the drive in my 20 gig jukebox recorder and put in a 60 gig drive and use it exclusively as a powered portable usb 2.0 drive ).
__label__0 i am very pleased with its quality and durability .
__label__0 cons summary :
__label__0 again had to remove the battery .
__label__0 that was annoying .
__label__0 this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .
__label__0 there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera !
__label__1 for those that are looking for camera phones just get the camera attachement and comes with the stereo headphones to listen to the radio in style .
__label__0 it ships with a carrying case that has a belt clip on it .
__label__0 the menus are very easy to navigate .
__label__1 also , there is the need to send the ipod to replace the batteries when they die ( which they will ).
__label__0 the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk .
__label__0 i had downloaded about 1000 songs and had room for another 9000 !
__label__0 there is probably an easier way to do this , i just have n't found it yet .
__label__0 i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition .
__label__0 awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package .
__label__0 the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving .
__label__0 my pda becames a digital album .
__label__0 i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it.
__label__1 and go from there ... if you chose one of the  all  options , then you do n't need to do anything until it 's done .
__label__0 as much as i like nokia phones the flip phones imo are much better because a ) you wont scratch your screens / keys b ) you dont need to lock your phone all the time to prevent accidently hitting the keys .
__label__0 all these phones have color screens , polymorphic tones , and are internet ready .
__label__0 one stopped working in february and the other in march .
__label__1 pay a few more bucks and get something else - it 'll be worth it in the long run .
__label__0 this is the second apex dvd player i 've had - and the last .
__label__0 the entire unit was poorly crafted .
__label__0 i bought this phone when it first came out in the summer .
__label__1 get those mp3s off your hard drive , save space , and enjoy your massive music library .
__label__0 i know there are five mp cameras out there , but this thing does just fine for me .
__label__0 you are not able to simply import files , but rather you have to go through multiple steps to find them .
__label__0 also , if i want a family plan , which mean i need tw phones on a plan .. .
__label__0 i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic .
__label__0 i like the way apple is innovative , but let 's face it - they can 't be the only one with an idea to enclose a 2.5  hd within an aluminum case in a stylish package for long , especially after the buzz is out of their little techie pod .
__label__0 i cancelled the order .
__label__0 i am not talking milliseconds .
__label__0 you get what you pay for .
__label__0 overall i like it .
__label__0 i love all of the features , and presets as well .
__label__0 this meant that i had to take all my cds and do in a fairly short period of time what i had done over a year at work .
__label__0 if my level of care was n't good enough , i had to expect that even if i paid to have it fixed it would break again in a month or two .
__label__0 if you have a lot of those , be prepared to convert to mp3 .
__label__0 i tried out some other brands in the stores , and was disappointed by the battery life of the other company ; plus what you see in the lcd ( no optical finder ) is n't what you get - not even for color ; the output was less than i expected .
__label__0 you know why ?
__label__1 a good choice could be cf type ii , microdrives that can store around 1 gb of images .
__label__0 for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison .
__label__1 this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features .
__label__0 i ended up suing windows player to make mp3 's ( actually wma files ) and then using the probram to transfer .
__label__0 it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video .
__label__0 i bought this thing because it plays everything .
__label__0 guess all that glitters is not gold .
__label__0 i will never use all the  whistles and bells  this machine is capable of .
__label__0 i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones .
__label__0 the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc. other nicities , that you would enjoy .
__label__0 anybody can explain that ?
__label__0 honestly , i love this player .
__label__0 i changed video cables , tried connecting to tv on input1 and input2 but no help .
__label__0 i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended .
__label__0 it took me about 5 minutes before i had mastered the controls .
__label__0 i just sold my archos 20gb jukebox recorder after not being satisfied with it 's slow loading & difficult navigation , not to mention it froze quite a bit .
__label__1 get better headphones .
__label__0 while the listing process is accurate for track names ( unlike windows ' reliance on the amg , which frequently gets track listings out of order ) , the results can be odd .
__label__0 now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 !
__label__0 a nice camera bag , which holds camera plus all the cables and the charger .
__label__0 if these otherwise minor issues can be fixed , i would rate this a 5 star machine .
__label__1 you can even skip that step and rip them directly from the cd to the player .
__label__1 buy new ones asap. every time you move your face or something they pop out .
__label__0 the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .
__label__0 a few things that might make it even better :
__label__0 so far the dvd works so i hope it does n't break down like the reviews i 've read .
__label__0 i pulled out our old non-progressive scan toshiba , hooked it back-up and the  finding nemo  dvd works fine .
__label__0 let 's face it - when you want to watch a movie you want to see a picture .
__label__0 i think the lack of the mp3 player being able to run without special software is also a downer , becuase it makes it more cumbersome for people less computer illiterate .
__label__0 it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .
__label__0 after receiving the box from amazon , i proceeded with charging the unit for the specified 4 hours , after which i installed the software and connected the unit to my pc via usb 2.0 .
__label__0 here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of  plastic-like  ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .
__label__0 not only was i was shopping for a camera that would suit my casual and artistic photographic needs , i had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well .
__label__0 awful , awful , awful .
__label__0 now let 's talk about the software .
__label__0 i 'll see how much help i can get from amazon and report back .
__label__0 the screen is covered , so to make any new selections you have to open it .
__label__1 if you want the other accessories the ipod offer , maybe that 's where you should go .. .
__label__0 nice little phone ... light compact . .
__label__0 7 picture quality is excellent .
__label__0 i find this to be a great feature .
__label__0 besides user error ( surprise , surprise ) , it 's hard to imagine people having trouble with either .
__label__0 finally , i uninstalled and reinstalled the software , the usual measure of last resort for this sort of thing .
__label__0 it lasts , truly , 7 days on standby .
__label__0 i would say that this is not a major issue , but it can be slightly annoying if you care about these things .
__label__0 when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat .
__label__0 i use my own mid-priced headphones rather than the enclosed earbuds .
__label__0 well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise .
__label__0 one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing .
__label__0 at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my  alias  dvds as well .
__label__1 you also have to set the g3 to second shutter sync , which is what youd want to do most of the time anyhow .
__label__0 the vibration is not top .
__label__1 i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .
__label__0 that 's important because i have a lot of music .
__label__0 it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set .
__label__0 in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it .
__label__0 i was able to return it to the retailer where i bought it and got a replacement .
__label__0 third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .
__label__0 ipod clearly has the most buzz .
__label__0 proven canon built quality and lens .
__label__0 i have not yet figured out how to make it snap quick pictures for action shots .
__label__0 4 an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery 's out is not included , although one can be purchased separately .
__label__0 their website does not show it as a compatible phone , and should i try to access the game downloads on t-zones the system returns an error message saying my phone is not supported .
__label__0 i wish it would do the same for movies , but that 's one rare / cool feature you will have to forgo .
__label__1 if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .
__label__0 otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; shutter delay is n't so bad either .
__label__0 on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured .
__label__0 the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust .
__label__1 for more info on digital cameras , go to dpreviews .
__label__1 if you can afford this camera , you can afford to get a better strap elsewhere - a very minor quibble .
__label__0 based on hardware one could assume the archos players were horrible ( which by hardware standards .. . they were ) .. .
__label__0 the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) .
__label__0 easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this
__label__0 i purchased this mp3 player just last night after doing some scouting around .
__label__0 many of our disney movies do n't play on this dvd player .
__label__0 hope someone else has better luck !
__label__0 it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen .
__label__0 difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say  difficult ,  but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate .
__label__1 i would recommend this product to anyone .
__label__0 my cuzin got an ipod and i wo n't say it is an awful product , but i will say that for the price , apple could do better as far as storage and battery life goes .
__label__0 7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .
__label__0 i was sitting on a train and it fell off my lap and broke .
__label__0 accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less .
__label__0 2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured .
__label__0 i purchased it from amazon on a since discontinued promotion .
__label__0 i assume this is the case for most cameras since it does not have enough power to do autofocus .
__label__1 i highly recommend this phone to anyone .
__label__0 silverish color really adds a special touch .
__label__0 one thing that i found out recently is that you do n't need t-zones from tmobile to go online .
__label__0 i showed her how to turn it on , where the lens zoom lever is , and she loves it !
__label__0 you can edit the genres once the songs are on the play if you decide to re-classify things later .
__label__1 you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll .
__label__0 the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots .
__label__0 no comments on reliability , warranty , repairs , accessories .
__label__0 the comments i 've read about having problems with this dvd player all seem to stem from pushing the incorrect buttons on the dvd remote.for instance , pushing the button to play pal ( european type ) movies , when an ntsc ( usa type ) movie disk is in the disk tray .
__label__0 the only drawbacks that i have noticed :
__label__0 i can 't comment on the quality of the audio , because it was back at the store before i ripped a single cd .
__label__0 we did n't get to use it again for over a month ( sad , i know ) .
__label__1 for those out there that are not familiar with mp3 encoding , you can encode your cd 's at varying quality levels .
__label__0 however , as an average person with unsteady hands , i doubt it 'll perform well in lower light settings .
__label__0 this camera has canon 's great colorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .
__label__0 upon inspection i did find a small scratch on the surface and figured that to be the cause .
__label__1 if you 're seeking that elusive state of photographic euphoria that is free of buyer 's remorse and filled with cool , then travel to the world of the coolpix 4300 !
__label__0 its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .
__label__0 but they do have this annoying habit of asking you if they 've answered all your questions , even if they did n't , to which they always seem to expect a  yes  answer from you .
__label__0 the good news is if you can 't get it to reset / reboot you can still pull the battery and reinstall it .
__label__0 second , the  automatic  sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .
__label__0 to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .
__label__0 but there are certain issues might be they are to me here - all of them are minor; not major ones though ,
__label__0 i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver .
__label__1 for simple point and shoot photography , consider a cheaper digital .
__label__0 usually around the time the 90 day warranty expires .
__label__0 moving the viewfinder elsewhere on the camera will remove the lens distortion but increase the parallax phenomenon .
__label__0 i bought this player as a christmas present for my wife .
__label__0 i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money .
__label__1 for prospective buyers , i would warn of the following : 1 ) purchase a better pair of headphones as soon as possible , as earbuds sound terrible and are terribly uncomfortable ( this applies to earbuds in general , ) and 2 ) make sure that your mp3s have id3 tags on them , that when when they are loaded into the playlist they will automatically sort themselves .
__label__0 however , the ad-2600 does n't have this feature ( for now ) .
__label__0 my favorite is to play  any track  - am rediscovering my music !
__label__0 i think you get what you pay for stands true .
__label__0 the player controls are too easy to hit accidentally .
__label__0 2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )
__label__0 it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want .
__label__0 i 've compared and compared and compared .
__label__0 the instructions that come with it do n't explain how to make things simple .
__label__0 you can send it in , but i would n't count on ever seeing it or a replacement again .
__label__0 the headset that comes with the phone has good sound volume but it hurts the ears like you cannot imagine !
__label__0 feels solid in hand .
__label__0 - this did not feel like quality construction and i was n't sure how long it would last .
__label__0 nikon got the final nod for its settings auto and manual along with movie modes , medium; compact size , price , brand name , good software that is included and previous reviews .
__label__0 imagine my shock - and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex .
__label__0 different people have different needs , of course , but the t-mobile plans are priced very well for the minutes and services you receive .
__label__0 i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him .
__label__0 minor gripe .
__label__0 we got a 256mb card , and have been hard-pressed to fill it over a weekend .
__label__0 while i am at the store i will definitely get the extended warranty as i have another day or so ( from the purchase date ) to obtain one .
__label__0 it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc .
__label__0 you need the remote control for this so you better get it from your dog before he burries it in the backyard .
__label__0 many before me have done that already .
__label__0 the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ahwile .
__label__0 the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .
__label__0 this player seems to work fine with everything else .
__label__1 this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
__label__0 one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does .
__label__0 this was the closest alternative and best buy for this type .
__label__0 the quality is superb .
__label__0 the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product .
__label__0 i feel that once i contact amazon that they will get to the bottom of this .
__label__1 notmad has other features too , but this is not an advertisement so please see the company 's web site for more information ...
__label__0 after installing it and trying to make it working for 30 minutes i went and bought notmad .
__label__0 the image quality is excellent .
__label__0 i bought a 512 mb card by simpletech and it works great with my canon .
__label__0 creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack .
__label__0 however , it seems that this is the general rule for most digital cameras .
__label__0 whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together .
__label__0 this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .
__label__0 i 'd like to see how well a small company supports its mp3 player in 2 years when its battery dies as all rechargeable do .
__label__0 that 's a huge plus by itself compared to the infamous ipod and similar mp3 players where the battery is permanently installed & removing it voids the warranty .
__label__0 the nikon coolpix 4300 deserves six .
__label__0 the phone may look large but it is very small smaller then the 3390 phone .
__label__0 a 256 mb player ( roughly 60 songs for me ) is about x amount of dollars but a 30 gb ( 30,000 mb ) player ( roughly 6,650 songs ) sells for only slightly more .
__label__0 it works great .
__label__0 i was able to improve things a bit by using the units equalizer and boosting the base .
__label__0 it takes great pictures .
__label__0 i am looking forward to my vegas trip for some great photographs now .
__label__0 i think for about $ 40 more , you can probably find a much better dvd player than this though .
__label__1 do n't waste your money .
__label__0 but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera .
__label__0 the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .
__label__0 im taking mine back tomorrow morning , and getting a nice shiny new ipod instead .
__label__0 2 . the speed is noticeably slower than canon , especially so with flashes on .
__label__0 ok , that happens , so i try to skip the chapter .
__label__0 i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .
__label__0 they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .
__label__0 it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working .
__label__0 this has made the greatest difference in the quality of my photographs : the built-in flash on any of these cameras gives you flat photos , red-eye , and annoying shadows ; a good add-on flash unit can be bounced off the ceiling or wall for pleasing , almost-natural lighting .
__label__0 i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra ... and i was not disappointed .
__label__0 this thing , while looking pretty cool , is not as sexy as the ipod .
__label__0 it 's bigger , but people have grossly exaggerated the size differences - it 's only about half an inch longer and 1/3 inch thicker than the new-generation ipods .
__label__0 it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop .
__label__0 i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product .
__label__1 by pressing p/n , you should be able to get a good picture on the screen .
__label__0 if you 're like me , that will definitely make you pause .
__label__0 this is my first digital camera and i could n't be happier .
__label__0 the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .
__label__0 because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's .
__label__1 if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it .
__label__0 they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it 's been 2 weeks without a reply .
__label__0 i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review .
__label__0 did buy a 256mb compact flash , it holds a lot of pics at any resolution .
__label__0 there are plenty other features that i have n't checked out , but i 'm sure i soon will .
__label__0 you have to skip to the next track when your hated song comes up with the ipod .
__label__0 i 'm very glad i did .
__label__0 i bought the 30gb zen xtra from a well-known national electronics store as soon as i saw they were advertising it for $ 219.99 .
__label__0 after reading the very positive review of this camera in a leading consumer magazine , i decided to head here , to amazon , to read through the online reviews .
__label__0 the higher the number the better the quality ( less data compression is used ) and the larger the file size .
__label__0 remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s .
__label__0 the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .
__label__1 if you 're someone who wants to put 10,000 songs on this thing you may want to encode at the lower end ( typically 128 is considered close to cd quality ).
__label__0 my gut tells me i 'll also end up buying an ipod .
__label__0 3 ) folders cannot be created for the audio files .
__label__0 and i let my kids shoot as many pics as they want , let them review them on the camera and just print the good ones ( which are not many ) .
__label__0 it requires significant force to operate which can be scary on such a small phone .
__label__0 the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .
__label__0 amazon is awaesome !
__label__0 i 'll still use my photosuite for editing .
__label__0 on an average , you would charge it once a week .
__label__0 if you do n't believe me on that , check the consumer reports review as well as the many digital camera review sites out there .
__label__0 however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .
__label__1 you are better off deleting it , re-ripping it with the new title and then transferring it to the player .
__label__0 i have but plan on selling my rebel ti and all of the equipment with it .
__label__0 features that would have been nice :
__label__0 nokia does not disappoint in this model .
__label__0 the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .
__label__0 and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control .
__label__1 overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it .
__label__1 if you are ok paying $ x00 for something that can be used now , but is likely to both get better and cost less in the future then try to determine which device is the lesser of evils for you .
__label__0 you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n't make that big of a disturbance .
__label__0 although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .
__label__0 the other company is currently  out of stock  so i ordered another from amazon and will be taking the original back to the competitor today .
__label__0 it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .
__label__0 so go and buy dis sucka beefo it all be gone an stuffff .
__label__0 so what 's the point ?
__label__0 it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx .
__label__0 other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .
__label__0 in two transfer batches ( first was english songs , then foreign languages ) , it did n't come up with any errors ( aside the duplicate name i mentioned ).
__label__0 also , the sound is wonderful ... my only gripe were those aweful earphones that this came with .
__label__0 i end up unplugging it from the wall for a few hours and when i try again it will work fine.at least until this problem arises again .
__label__0 a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop
__label__0 i highly regret trying to save a few $ with this purchase .
__label__0 this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .
__label__0 if you have a question , they have the answer .
__label__0 4 ) usb 2.0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! ).
__label__0 oh my goodness --
__label__0 2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection .
__label__0 as i travelled internationally and did n't want to haul it back on a plane with me it was an expensive addition to the recycling bin .
__label__0 the sound quality is very good .
__label__0 btw , if you * are * ripping your cds , mediasource accesses the cddb music catalog over the internet and the few cds i experimented with all provided good quality [ correct & uncluttered ] tag information .
__label__0 software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n't mind buying notmad .
__label__0 in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots .
__label__0 i have tried the belkin tunecast mobile fm transmitter but found there was too much interference .
__label__0 not an urgent issue , as it still works .. .
__label__0 i have been trying for over a week to contact apex .
__label__0 so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option .
__label__0 it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .
__label__0 just before we all spent a couple weeks in an rv together .
__label__0 the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .
__label__0 well that was not a simple task .
__label__0 this is my fourth mp3 player ( creative nomad jukebox2 and 3 , rio chie , and this one ) , and my third player from creative .
__label__1 i 'm giving this player cautious recommendation .
__label__0 else with simpler viking cf cards , it takes couple of seconds to write a picture with approximately  fine ** picture quality   image size : 1600 .
__label__0 the service from the supplier was exceptional .
__label__0 i dropped it from the couch , landed on carpet and the cover and battery flew out .
__label__0 without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !
__label__0 this is a nice feature ( i.e. it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to  easy listening  rather than  heavy metal  - no problem .
__label__0 no line out jack - as i said , there is none .
__label__0 both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going .
__label__0 in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .
__label__0 i've bought one for the den and will buy a 2nd one for the bedroom .
__label__0 the software sucks .
__label__0 it plays all my back-ups , + or - , and everything else i have put in it without a hick up .
__label__0 has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .
__label__0 another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .
__label__0 this one was rated very high by several people check out this site and epinions.com .
__label__0 i bought 2 of these phones 2 months ago for myself and my girlfriend .
__label__0 it took over 2 months and repeated follow-up to get it replaced .
__label__0 this required patience as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it ( which i could do with my flash player ) .
__label__1 overall , i highly recommend this phone .
__label__0 one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all .
__label__0 it allows me to place the phone on the table while talking and working on my computer or other jobs .
__label__0 the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg , kodak pic 's and dvd-r ) i have read other reviews and some good and some not so good , but my feeling at this time is  two thumbs up  !
__label__0 after using the bulky 3650 for three weeks , i searched for a smaller alternative .
__label__0 i was worried about this after seeing a friend change batteries on his olympus after about 20-30 pictures .
__label__0 after charging my card for the camera and for expedited shipping , 5 business days later , they still had n't shipped the product .
__label__0 it do n't get any better then the nikon 4300 .
__label__0 i try navigating using the player 's built in menu , and it still would n't work !
__label__0 it has a hold button to deactivate the buttons to avoid accidents ; however , enough reviewers have complained that the hold button is easily broken and then the device can 't be used .
__label__0 buttons do seem a little sticky tho .. and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem ..
__label__0 choosing zennx is a no-brainer when factoring in the cost of a new $ 400 + ipod every few years versus the $ 50 cost of replacing zennx 's rechargeable battery .
__label__0 i needed something with more power , so i bought a nikon coolpix 4300 .
__label__0 i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .
__label__0 i purchased this as a christmas gift on 12-4 - 03 .
__label__0 the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person .
__label__0 the product manufacturer promised me 14 hours , and what i recieved was 6-8 .
__label__0 the radio :
__label__0 this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .
__label__0 the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .
__label__1 fair warning - do not buy .
__label__0 it does have a lense cap , but it wo n't let you take pics with it on which is real good .
__label__0 in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !
__label__0 less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows  no disc .
__label__0 well , anyway i could go on and on on why this player did n't meet my expectations .. .
__label__0 the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad .
__label__0 after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile !
__label__0 i am really impressed by this dvd player .
__label__0 well thats about it , and as people said in earlier previews that the headfone jack gets messed up , stil havent happened to me , and i hope it doesnt .
__label__0 nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price .
__label__0 with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .
__label__1 recommended to anyone looking to purchase a low priced dvd player and not expecting any bells or whistles from a brand name one like sony .
__label__0 i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .
__label__0 just maintain them ( phonebook , calendar and to-do list ) in ms outlook or lotus notes and transfer data back and forth .
__label__0 4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
__label__0 that is a very nice feature .
__label__0 finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 .
__label__0 there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient .
__label__0 i have been assured this will be fixed soon .
__label__0 the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .
__label__0 if anybody knows of a remote to work this-i 'd love to hear from you !
__label__0 battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours .
__label__0 my girlfriend loved using this camera so much as a point and shoot that i had to pry it out of her hands most of the time .
__label__0 often i fill i need to have better organization for the library and there is not enought of variables .
__label__1 if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 !
__label__0 i was watching pirates of the caribbean and decided to watch the extras disc .
__label__0 player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play .
__label__0 i ordered this player for christmas , and so far i have it for only 2 weeks .
__label__0 despite all the hype about ipods , i knew i wanted something different , because i wanted more storage than the ipod i could afford would offer , and because i wanted more flexibility in where i purchased music online .
__label__0 zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod .
__label__0 still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera .
__label__0 obviously there is no composite video output and different analog audio signals at progressive scan mode .
__label__0 i have one thing to say to the numbskulls who complain that this camera 's controls are confusing and hard to remember :
__label__0 the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .
__label__0 i read reviews , compared specs , and visited user forums .
__label__1 do n't waste time looking at anything else , just buy this one .
__label__0 controls easy yo use and easy to get to .
__label__0 1 ) price / gb of storage
__label__0 i bought the 2600 because it plays everything !
__label__0 i did a good month 's worth of research before buying this over other similar priced digital cameras , and this is the best buy for the buck .
__label__0 when i hit  menu  it told me ,  playback only .
__label__0 i will never purchase anything from this company ever again and have logged my complaint with the bbb .
__label__0 it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n't cover up the ac jack .
__label__0 i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient .
__label__0 one thing puzzles me is that for  fine and 2200 +  quality pictures , one ultra 256mb cf card can only hold 130-140 pics , but the size of the pictures are only around 1.2 mb , the math does not add up .
__label__0 my  fast forward  button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go .
__label__0 i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .
__label__0 as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine .
__label__0 the blue-screen display in the zennx xtra model is an improvement , but the toggle switch is still tricky .
__label__0 got a great deal from a reputable seller .
__label__0 after the first one fatally crashed , the replacement did not work .
__label__0 the physical appearance of this apex compared to one previous ( ad1100w ) is most appreciated .
__label__0 the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models .
__label__0 i had never loaded my cds on to my home computer , using my work computer instead .
__label__0 the second one was the 2500 which i think is better than the 2600 because it has more features such as karoake which i do use sometimes for parties .
__label__1 get it , it 's woth every penny ! !
__label__0 her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use .
__label__1 this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it .
__label__0 what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .
__label__0 the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .
__label__0 i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .
__label__0 the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered .
__label__0 i personally do n't like apple or their business practices ( screwing resellers , customers and employees left and right ) so i shopped around for something else .
__label__0 i think this is it 's biggest flaw .
__label__0 i might have gotten a lemon , but this is not the first report of video output failure on this machine .
__label__0 one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .
__label__0 6 . the g2 's  color effect  exposure mode has now been removed , the replacement is a selectable  effect func  menu option available in all exposure modes .
__label__0 now that i have all my music on it there has n't been any more problems .
__label__0 it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .
__label__0 but you do n't have to be .
__label__0 perhaps because of its smaller user base there is also a lack of accessories .
__label__0 pictures produced by the panasonic were excellent .
__label__0 of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest .
__label__0 it wo n't play all of my movies .
__label__0 after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .
__label__0 i have owned this camera for a short time and would n't give it up for anything .
__label__0 4 .the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) .
__label__0 i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .
__label__0 i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic !
__label__0 from the other reviews i 've read , it sounds like that wo n't be the end of my troubles .
__label__0 another irriation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on .
__label__0 yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway .
__label__0 the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did .
__label__0 i spoke to a rep. at apex and was told that a new format is being used and we wont be able to view any disney movies made in the last couple months .
__label__0 the phone is very light weight .
__label__0 there are six default settings ( off , vivid , sepia , neutral , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening , contrast and saturation .
__label__0 i do n't really like bounce .
__label__0 regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop .
__label__0 it did also seem to have a strong  new electronics  smell for some time .
__label__0 -- an event that involves dogs running and jumping hurdles .
__label__0 1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it .
__label__0 every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .
__label__0 ( throw a cell phone and you 're asking for trouble . ) 3a .
__label__0 after much research i decided on the nikon coolpix 4300 .
__label__0 word ... peace in the east bruvah .
__label__1 if you are looking for a very simple point and shoot camera , this is probably not what you are looking for .
__label__1 i highly recommend it .
__label__0 transferred the zens new software onto it in about 10 seconds .
__label__0 thought i 'd weigh in here with my stats .
__label__0 it was no problem for me to use their software .
__label__0 what more could you ask for .
__label__0 better actually cause my carpet looks clean , lol .
__label__1 and with the 500 you save you could print the results for the life of the camera .
__label__0 just make sure the keys are locked .
__label__0 i wanted it to shoot concerts as well .
__label__0 now , even 1 star seems like i 'm giving creative the benefit of the doubt .
__label__0 the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .
__label__0 this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it .
__label__0 the build quality feels solid , it does n't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dts and dd5.1 sound good ) .
__label__0 the canon allows you to change lenses , and it accepts the ibm microdrive ( type ii compact flash ) , so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage .
__label__0 ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n't even gotten to all of them yet .
__label__0 note : this will add about $ 30 to the price to purchase , but worth it
__label__0 i did n't had any problem till now .
__label__0 i 've tried the sony s85 with the carl zeiss lens , but the pictures were too digital .
__label__0 as said before this works perfectly .
__label__1 despite these grieps , i still recommend the camera .
__label__0 to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod .
__label__0 i doubt anyone has ever seen an add or commercial for any other mp3 player .
__label__0 i bought myself an rca mp3-cd player , and i 'm happy with that until a cheap , worthwhile mp3 player coomes out .
__label__0 i just got a 40gb ipod to replace my zen ( a 20gb model ) .
__label__0 hopefully you still have the remote control .
__label__0 notmad worked right away after install and it is what i would like to see from the product .
__label__0 i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .
__label__0 same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing .
__label__0 i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .
__label__0 this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records .
__label__1 try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .
__label__0 i 've had no problem with canon whatsoever .
__label__0 i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price .
__label__0 there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my prev. machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance .
__label__0 only 1 problem , no accessories ... yet .
__label__0 i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .
__label__0 ( i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down - maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead ) .
__label__0 i like to play my music by album and the nomad jukebox plays the songs in the same order as the actual cd .
__label__0 this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways .
__label__0 i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .
__label__0 i expect the g3 will please me for years to come .
__label__0 this is especially useful for those who listen mostly to pop music and store all those short ditties .
__label__0 sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod .
__label__0 several people have complained of difficulty transferring multiple songs with the same title .
__label__0 i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .
__label__0 i wish canon would work out some way for that issue .
__label__0 the powershot g3 is a great camera .
__label__0 personally , i do n't understand all the complaints about the interface .. .
__label__0 when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture !
__label__0 i bought one of these phones in kuwait to use with the mtc prepaid telephone service ez because i would be able to use it when i return to the states with t-mobile .
__label__0 the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .
__label__1 but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose .
__label__0 i 'm not sure if it would survive a fall from 3 feet .
__label__0 now getting back to this .
__label__0 that 's all for now .
__label__0 it also has an optical out , which it should .
__label__1 for the money , get a better quality player .
__label__0 the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses !
__label__0 if the casing of the player is this bad , i can 't image that the hardware is of very good quality .
__label__0 the only thing the ipod has over the nomad is the style , size , and ease of use .
__label__0 for me , i 'll save that cash for another purchase .
__label__0 update : apple recently announced that for $ 107 , it will replace the battery in ipods shipped to their factory .
__label__0 i will never go back to my archos again ! !
__label__0 an ipod with the same amount of memory is $ 150 cheaper .
__label__0 overall i 'm happy with my toy .
__label__0 with an extra battery and a couple of good sized memory cards you are all set for a day of picture taking while on vacation .
__label__0 this can be done on a song by song basis or in mass .
__label__0 the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .
__label__0 i could crush this thing in half with two fingers if i wanted to .
__label__0 it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .
__label__0 so far so good , no problems , no conversions .
__label__0 - i did n't care much for the tilting lcd screen , it seemed very limited and not very usefull .
