__label__1 just double check with customer service to ensure the number provided by amazon is for the city / exchange you wanted .
__label__0 i purchased one of these to replace an ailing dvd player that 's a few years old .
__label__0 this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price .
__label__0 the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .
__label__0 the service from t-mobile is very good too .
__label__0 the g2 was slightly curvy with a champagne finish -- very homely .
__label__0 i simply watched the extra features on another player .
__label__0 hehe , my bad .
__label__0 i got mine for $ 160 less than the ipod 30gb ( got an extra $ 30 off for applying for an amazon visa ... thanks amazon ! )
__label__1 rip your tunes at 192kb if you like , alhthough 128kb sounds just dandy , and you 'll get more tunes stored on it .
__label__0 i tried called apex cust service , no help .
__label__0 i thought it would be haggard but when i be gotted this junky i was mad happy and stuff .
__label__0 even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .
__label__0 it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i.e. organizer ) , and the radio !
__label__0 i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far .
__label__0 karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity .
__label__0 if i knew then what i know now i would have paid the extra to get an ipod & avoided the zen .
__label__0 some amazon reviewers say it corrrupted their music files ;
__label__0 then it rips the tunes into mp3s and puts them on your computer .
__label__0 i do n't care how it looks and i always drive so the size is not important to me .
__label__0 i am using musicmatch to rip & catalog ( and if i choose , download ) music ;
__label__0 3 . it 's a hazard in the car .
__label__1 yes , the ipod looks in tune with the carefully articulated urban-hipster persona thats become popular as of late , but sure-as-hell is n't worth the $ 200 premium ( unless you are just dying to match your music player with that volkswagen beetle and urban outfitters wardrobe ) .
__label__0 i was going to get a 10gb ipod , but after looking at the 10 day warranty for ipod and www.ipodsdirtysecret.com ( battery lasts 18 months ;
__label__0 have used it frequently and have had no problems .
__label__0 this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .
__label__0 since the ipod lacks this review feature on its auto-sync and it only allows one-way transfers , the first time i connected my ipod to my laptop , i wiped out the 20gb of music i had transferred from my desktop to the ipod .
__label__0 you can also search for your song , which is good .
__label__0 i am back to using # 1 .
__label__0 it 's because the 256 player uses flash memory ( smaller / lighter ) and the 30gb uses a hard drive .
__label__0 the interface used could be better designed .
__label__0 i would expecct the card to hold over 200 pictures for size of 1.2 mb/per .
__label__0 the navigion on it can be a little quirky , but still operates better than the zen 's did .
__label__0 i discovered this weekend that itunes does not sell mp3 's in the mp3 format .
__label__0 my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .
__label__0 headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature .
__label__0 songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags , which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver .
__label__0 for the price , it 's a very nice dvd player .
__label__0 the reception and sound quality are top-notch .
__label__0 yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n't like it too but no harm done since i always use the camea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; that is what lmost exactly ot the picture .
__label__0 kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that .
__label__0 i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again .
__label__0 this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared .
__label__0 i also did n't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode .
__label__0 3 . i wanted a camera that had a lot of built-in settings for different types of suroundings while giving me an option to use my photography skills although , i am an amateur with an interest in photography by turning on the manual settings .
__label__0 i find a great amount of value in this option for any and all the people that travel buy car and do not have access to the t-mobile  hot-spots  .
__label__0 ( well thats only for old-school die-hard optical viewfinder fans ) use lcd instead which is brilliant and you can twist around too .
__label__1 spend the money its well worth it .
__label__0 i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .
__label__1 maybe if you delete those files before you looked at them with the software , youd see the true , raw image that the camera actually produces .
__label__1 this phone is highly recommended otherwise .
__label__0 i have read a lot of the reviews and my phone does not have a hiss or anything that people are talking about .
__label__1 looks sort of like picasa software ( google it if you dont know ) in the interface and is as easy to install and operate as g2 's , but more intuitive .
__label__0 software : for the people who complain about software , please , stop complaining .
__label__0 it 's not a big deal for me .
__label__0 i would rate this is 4.5 stars picture quality ; image size defined above are specific to nikon coolpix .
__label__0 i just bought this player today and i already love it .
__label__0 notmad by red chair software is an explorer-based program that enables simple drag-and-drop transfer of music files from pc to zennx .
__label__0 the batteries would not charge .
__label__0 as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better .
__label__0 i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .
__label__0 it defaulted to unchangeable email .
__label__0 so easy to set up , had some problems with my archos .
__label__0 best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .
__label__0 the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical
__label__0 all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift .
__label__0 the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n't notice after first day .
__label__0 i have had great experience with amazon , but i will probably not buy electronics any more from them to avoid any future return problems .
__label__0 go for it !
__label__0 repair seems to be an issue ; some say the repair do n't exist
__label__0 i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch widescreen dvd 's to normal .
__label__0 however , indoor pictures of subjects more than a few feet away can be blurry or grainy .
__label__1 point the  media sniffer  to your music files and let it do the rest .
__label__1 i would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation .
__label__0 they take excellent macro shots as well .
__label__0 the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel .
__label__0 i 'm editing my review , because now i wish i read the manual before returning the player i bought for my girlfriend .
__label__0 this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket .
__label__1 do yourself a favor and save your money to get something of better quality , or at least works .
__label__0 it only comes in 20gb ; enough for most people , not for those with large collections ripped at high sampling rates .
__label__0 3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .
__label__0 i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .
__label__0 i only wish you could get high quality tiff images at all resolutions , but does n't seem any of the buget cameras do .
__label__0 with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .
__label__0 the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .
__label__0 the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used .
__label__0 great colors , pictures and white balance .
__label__0 there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote .
__label__0 apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy .
__label__0 apex does n't answer the phone .
__label__1 do not buy this player .
__label__0 so what 's the problem ?
__label__0 i could n't be happier with t-mobile either , i switched from cingular .
__label__0 as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand .
__label__0 i 'm sure that this camera has all the wonderful features that others talk about .
__label__0 in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .
__label__0 my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .
__label__0 i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www.ipodsdirtysecret.com.
__label__0 i plan on buying a second battery and a larger cf for it .
__label__1 i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price .
__label__0 the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing !
__label__0 bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .
__label__0 there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk !
__label__0 the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .
__label__0 if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders .
__label__0 i did quite a bit of research before buying this camera , and this one had everything i was looking for .
__label__0 the ipod is also an attractable piece , being lightweight and small .
__label__0 it became stucked which makes it almost impossible to switch between modes .
__label__0 i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n't had any problems .
__label__0 a big plus in my book .
__label__1 but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything .
__label__0 moreover , they want a total of $ 107 to repair it .
__label__0 as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale .
__label__0 it is lightweight , sleek and attractive .
__label__0 the reasons below will be true for any product in this category .
__label__0 most people probably wanted the ipod before realizing that a vast array of full-featured viable alternatives exist .
__label__0 i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment .
__label__0 settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .
__label__0 the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .
__label__0 i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched !
__label__0 without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen .
__label__0 i bought a digi-slave dsf-1s flash unit .
__label__0 this thing plays everything i feed it .
__label__0 software is easy to use ( although redhat software is better , but costs money )
__label__0 transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2.0 .
__label__0 our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .
__label__0 it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features .
__label__0 battery life is good for a phone of this size .
__label__0 hopefully , this player will out sell the ridculously over-hyped i-pod .
__label__0 the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; not sensitive enough at others .
__label__0 signal strength will affect the battery life .
__label__0 please note that this is the first digital camera i have owned or used .
__label__0 both the samsung and the sony phones offer a lot more features than this 6610 .
__label__0 i am a business user who heavily depend on mobile service .
__label__0 wish it included somebody to re-rip all the songs .
__label__0 sound quality :
__label__0 first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes .
__label__0 10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc. , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter .
__label__0 after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift .
__label__0 having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .
__label__0 i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .
__label__0 i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem .
__label__0 i would 've still bought this drive even if i knew about this issue beforehand .
__label__0 im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button !
__label__0 the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .
__label__0 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting .
__label__0 the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera .
__label__0 anyways there are ways to set up your 6610 to connect to csd which uses regular minutes and you are surfing the net , being able to download pics and ringtones ( not java apps , you need t-zones for that ) .
__label__0 again , the ipod is a beautiful thing to look at and touch , player controls are less functional .
__label__0 yes , i have red-eye off , and yes , i 've tried adding a flash .
__label__0 it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device .
__label__0 i have n't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .
__label__0 for other problems go to http://www.apexdigitalinc.com/support.asp
__label__1 do n't waste your time , engery , resources on this thing , just spend a little more for a far more functional ipod .
__label__0 i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome .
__label__1 just highlight the songs you want to transfer from your playlist or music library then click one button and it 's done !
__label__0 however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once .
__label__0 i do n't think i was asking too much .
__label__0 every phone experience has started with a very brief time on hold followed by a cheerful representative answering the phone .
__label__0 i love my new nomad , its great !
__label__0 in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place .
__label__0 while it is an alternative to the ipod and one of the few viable ones its just that , an alternative and why would anyone seek an alternative to something that really needs no alternative choice because theres nothing wrong and everything right with it .
__label__0 5 two different adapters -- ur-e 4 and ur-e 7 -- are required for some attachment lenses .
__label__0 great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .
__label__0 even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
__label__1 if you have to buy a camera on a buget, this has got to be the one .
__label__0 my wife , who has never used a camera before , picked it up and soon got the hang of the fact that if you do n't like what you have created you just delete and try again .
__label__1 buyer beware ! sort your songs and adjust the titles accordingly ( maybe this applies to other players too , and not just the nomad , i do n't know ) .
__label__0 it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .
__label__0 having to copy / delete files would be time-consuming and is rendered a non-issue with 40gb of storage .
__label__0 2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .
__label__1 to get back to the menu of the dvd you have to press  menu  on the remote while the dvd is playing .
__label__0 once i read the manual i was able to point and shoot without having to fumble around trying to figure out where the controls are located .
__label__0 but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .
__label__0 i bought the nomad when i went home on leave and it worked great for about a month .
__label__0 usb 2.0 transfer is insanely fast .
__label__0 unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved .
__label__0 the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .
__label__0 sound quality is amazing. i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .
__label__0 wow , dennis sure is great !
__label__0 i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards .
__label__0 for those of you using a mac in os x+ there is no twain utility to download your pics directly into photoshop .
__label__0 i listened to it for several days before needing to recharge them .
__label__1 if the hard drive on your computer should fail , better have your music backed up somewhere or its gone !
__label__0 overall design :
__label__1 do n't drop this unit :
__label__0 first of all i have been a big nokia fan and have been upgrading my cell phones about once a year ( right after the release contract is over ) .
__label__0 a similarily priced 15gb ipod would n't have been nearly enough room .
__label__0 also , if i had already loaded and tagged by cds on my home computer , this would not have been an issue .
__label__0 the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect .
__label__0 you have to add all the songs to a play list .
__label__0 it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .
__label__0 * eax equalizer accentuates dimished quality of mp3 files .
__label__0 sheesh ! !
__label__0 so i spent half an hour on the phone with tech support , only to have the online tech person pull one off the shelf and tell me he had the same problem .
__label__0 i thought this was the ultimate phone when it comes to basic features , but i was dissapointed when i saw that it was only a gsm comaptible phone .
__label__0 what task do they perform ?
__label__0 we 'll see if i need them to .
__label__0 my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money .
__label__0 also have had it lock up when i shut it down to attend to a phone call .
__label__0 now i may buy two !
__label__0 in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % .
__label__1 because of this , i am disappointed and would not recommend this product .
__label__0 this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it .
__label__0 - since i wrote the review above in january 2003 , i still love this camera .
__label__0 i have had it lock up after a transfer of music .
__label__0 hope to get my refund in a timely manner .
__label__0 i had no problems following their installation instructions .
__label__0 price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .
__label__0 i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs .
__label__0 typically people use 96kbs to 320 kps.
__label__0 the p/n button switches your dvd players video output signal between pal and ntsc .
__label__0 now i know better .
__label__0 scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling .
__label__0 removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .
__label__0 i took great care of the screen , till i realized that the part that might get scratched is part of the cover .
__label__0 very sleek & stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has .
__label__0 it 'll take 10-15 business days for them to decide form when they get it .
__label__0 way less expensive than the ipod .
__label__0 the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button .
__label__0 nokia 6610 ( sound quality ) the phone is great with very cool features &#38; options , but comparing to my older motorola phone , it gets a failing grade in speaker quality .
__label__0 it does n't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive .
__label__0 apex is made in usa and is one of the underrated brands out there .
__label__0 and the remote is cheap and cheasy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck !
__label__0 i 'd like to see my old carrier do that !
__label__0 because this camera is beautiful .
__label__0 it 's money down the drain .
__label__0 it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs .
__label__0 it is also one of the few electronic items that works right out of the box .
__label__0 you have to buy better ones .
__label__0 i have done some research and experimenting with the remote when my apex ad-2500 seemed to have lost its video signal .
__label__0 file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2.0 .
__label__0 otherwise feedback seems to be good .
__label__0 one complaint ... the screen is too easily scratched !
__label__0 first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed .
__label__0 most of these  annoyances  , though , are comparable to what you 'll find on other cameras in this price range .
__label__0 i 've had no problems with the software .
__label__0 it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n't the only one this happened to . )
__label__0 is this possible to fix , if so how , if not does notmad explorer from red chair software do this ?
__label__0 also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying .
__label__0 we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .
__label__0 ( wo n't leave copy on your computer . )
__label__0 5 . the 1/200 sec , f5.6 + nd filter for highly exposed ( or very brightly lit ) environments .
__label__0 after  loading  for what seemed like a very long time , the display indicated  no disk  .
__label__0 to me this alludes to the manufacturer 's confidence that the product will last for a year .
__label__1 dont let the bad reviews of the software change your mind .
__label__0 because , you will be dissapointed .
__label__0 i 've owned a panasonic and sony dvd and this one outperforms in function and image quality and most of all , access speed .
__label__0 i made the mistake of thinking i could easily manage my mp3 library with this device .
__label__0 unlike some of the other people who received a  lemon  , my dvd player came in perfect working condition .
__label__0 not plug & play ; relies on id3 ; no fm or recording
__label__0 i purchased and returned this product , but not because of any glaring flaws in the design .
__label__0 i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots .
__label__0 drop if just a few inches on a hard surface and the faceplate pops off ( but not if it 's in its case ) .
__label__0 this almost made it worth the price alone .
__label__0 ( he had owned two apex dvd players , and was pleased with both of them . )
__label__0 so now it still plays everything , you just can 't see it !
__label__0 i actually had to re-open the drawer and close it to get back to the dvd menu .
__label__0 if it were not for that i would have given it 4 .
__label__0 there are not a lot of good options out there .
__label__0 i wish the camera had a higher optical zoom so that i could take better wildlife photos .
__label__0 they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet .
__label__0 duplicates are a no brainer and cheap .
__label__0 the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition .
__label__0 perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy  off  brands .
__label__0 i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up .
__label__0 it plays everything , even vcd 's .
__label__0 sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .
__label__0 i returned to the store , whereupon the clerk insisted that he could make it work ; he could n't .
__label__0 but i did n't because i 'm used to electronic products having a 12 month warranty .
__label__0 but you might find my review useful , nonetheless .
__label__0 about the only legitimate criticsm from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .
__label__0 this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .
__label__0 people have paid me money just to borrow it because its so elegant .
__label__0 also , very light and portable .
__label__0 amazon was supposed to send me another one , but did n't and sent me a gift certificate instead ( i 'm guessing because the price has gone up on this unit since december ).
__label__0 then sorting the files is easy as pie .
__label__0 i also purchased a good sturdy tripod : the combination of the new camera , tripod and remote control enabled me to take some remarkable indoor , natural-light portraits i never would have attempted before .
__label__0 no big deal for the size . .
__label__0 in english , this means that even straight out of the box , you 'll be amazed at the pics you end up taking .
__label__0 the first one we installed did n't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least .
__label__0 eax on : 6 hours eax off : 8.5 hours
__label__0 so i do n't know what the previous review that could n't do more than 30 songs is talking about .
__label__0 anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it .
__label__0 i do n't have a dvd + r to try
__label__0 the grain was terrible .
__label__0 you can find any song quicky by an artist , album , or genre search .
__label__0 while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .
__label__0 makes me use it much less than i otherwise would .
__label__0 i was considering buying the minolta f-100 and the sony dsc-p 9 , but at the camera shop , realized this one went above and beyond .
__label__0 + takes sharp 5mp photo 's , has great features and relatively easy to use .
__label__0 ( this includes the $ 20 that you have to pay up front , just to get them to look at your player . )
__label__0 with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .
__label__0 you have to tilt the phone around to catch the light on them .
__label__0 the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera .
__label__0 i took the camera and just gave it to someone .
__label__0 the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
__label__0 battery life is ok .
__label__0 seemed like a good deal , but this pos frequently cannot recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes ,  no disc  .
__label__0 2 . most mp3 players have a gap between the end of one track and the start of the next ; it 's annoying in music that is intended to be continuous .
__label__0 the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .
__label__0 now i dont have to lug around 80 cds if i dont know what i 'm going to want to listen to biking home .
__label__0 getting files onto it is quick and painless .
__label__0 i dare you to surf the net and find the code .
__label__0 the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones .
__label__0 2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax .
__label__0 zens rule .
__label__1 if you have the money and need 40 gb , this is the player for you .
__label__0 guess i will return it for an exchange and hope for the best with the new one .
__label__0 there 's a noticeable difference in the quality of a 4 megapixel image versus the 2 megapixels of the s330 , especially if you want to crop and enlarge the pictures .
__label__0 i hope that amazon will let me trade it for a different , more trusted brand of dvd player .
__label__0 ok so i donno about what other people said , how the player breaks and stuff , and the headfone jack , fortunately that did not happen to me .
__label__0 the zen has a detachable face plate that allows the battery to be replaced .
__label__0 i challenge anyone ( who is not in direct sun at the beach at noon ) to say it is fast and responsive .
__label__0 the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .
__label__0 i have a large but not huge cd collection and have loaded everything i want to listen to on it and still have 13 gigabytes free .
__label__0 having 4000 or so mp3s , i never got more than 500 transfered .
__label__0 i have had this dvd player for about 3 months now .
__label__0 the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .
__label__0 most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera .
__label__0 7 . a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view .
__label__0 now , for the t-mobile service :
__label__0 like many others , i had not abused the product , and had tried to take care of it .
__label__0 noiseless , lightweight and oh yeah .
__label__0 this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel .
__label__0 the longest that i have n't charged it was maybe 3 days and that 's turning it off every now and then .
__label__0 it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for .
__label__0 well to say , i had a very bad history with players .
__label__0 their customer ( www.apexdigitalinc.com ) service is very poor .
__label__0 i found it intuitive to use ( i did n't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) .
__label__0 this thing kicks mighty apple butt !
__label__0 what i really want is a $ 1,500 digital slr with a full frame sensor that will take my nikon lenses .
__label__0 the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .
__label__0 the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .
__label__0 i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use .
__label__0 that 's a huge difference ... especially in this price range .
__label__0 not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .
__label__0 this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
__label__0 now i have to return it and rip all my music again .
__label__0 please , if anyone want sell to me this cell phone in my conditions , i 'm wait very happy .
__label__1 here 's something you have to know before you considering about buying this one .
__label__0 yet they 've gotten rid of most of the languages that should be in the phone , including italian , german , and dutch .
__label__0 i 'm really happy with this purchase .
__label__0 the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .
__label__0 i suppose that you could jog with it but it seems to be made for the enjoyment of music .
__label__0 what more can you ask for from a $ 40 dvd player ?
__label__0 using the remote control , press the i/p button located on the bottom right corner of the remote .
__label__0 the buttons and interface are very easy to use .
__label__0 2 . battery life is over 4.5 hours , compared to about 2.5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikons .
__label__0 the canon g3 improves in almost all ways on the g1 and g2 before it , and in fact beats the nikon coolpix 5000 in performance ( picture quality and battery life ) -- which is amazing because the 5000 is a 5 megapixel camera and the canon is a 4 megapixel camera .
