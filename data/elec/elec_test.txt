__label__0 set up was easy and we enjoyed it for just over a week ./n__label__0 at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice ./n__label__0 the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine ./n__label__0 the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset ./n__label__0 my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money ./n__label__0 the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices ./n__label__1 just highlight the songs you want to transfer from your playlist or music library then click one button and it 's done !/n__label__0 it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to ./n__label__0 it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something ./n__label__1 for those of you who has problems with this player , i 'd suggest checking the owners manual to get the right setting so that you are not displaying the wrong mode and have no picture , etc./n__label__0 zen good points :/n__label__1 if you want to listen to tunes while you travel , i 'd get a hard drive because you can put so much on the thing - including audio books ./n__label__0 people i talk to on the speakerphone are shocked when it comes out at times that i 'm even using a speakerphone ./n__label__0 the second one was the 2500 which i think is better than the 2600 because it has more features such as karoake which i do use sometimes for parties ./n__label__0 by the way my alias dvds are legit too not no bootleg from the internet ./n__label__1 the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead ./n__label__1 if you watch dvds once in a while like i do , get this !/n__label__0 but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing ./n__label__0 this one csr insisted on trying to get me to say that he 'd answered all my questions ( same interaction as i just described ) , and well .. ./n__label__0 the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class ./n__label__1 or save time and just do it , you wo n't regret it ./n__label__0 most of the time , my g3 is a well-behaved camera ./n__label__0 perhaps there is a way around this delay ./n__label__1 just get some new headphones and your set ./n__label__0 the adobe camera raw plug-in shows once again that hardware is miles ahead of software ./n__label__0 first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most asthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture ./n__label__0 i think a $ 39 dissapointment is better then a $ 125 dissapointment !/n__label__0 no way to contact their customer service ./n__label__0 9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time ./n__label__0 it has many great features and very few bad ones ./n__label__0 i am still trying to resolve the problem with the second one ./n__label__0 regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop ./n__label__0 based on my used , 1 full charge was enough for at least 255 shots ./n__label__0 downloads are a snap and quick ./n__label__0 simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use ./n__label__0 i am willing to overlook it 's problems to get superior sound quality and low price , although i feel the player has a lot of room for improvement ./n__label__0 a great buy ./n__label__0 if i could give this a negative rating , i would ./n__label__0 they take excellent macro shots as well ./n__label__0 bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent ./n__label__0 i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots ./n__label__0 the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial. its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )/n__label__0 i bought this player during a christmas sale at an excellent price ./n__label__0 great camera , great investment !/n__label__0 overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view ./n__label__0 it suppose to play everything ./n__label__0 this thing kicks mighty apple butt !/n__label__0 the mediasource itself was flaky ... crashing my explorer twice within the first hour ( the crash did n't require a reboot ) ... but after another reboot , it has n't crashed since ./n__label__0 as with taking digital pictures , i notice other people including myself have errors on their compactflash which results in certain shots being partially taken or lost - this is an issue that seems to effect compactflash and other digicam brand ./n__label__0 so go and buy dis sucka beefo it all be gone an stuffff ./n__label__0 just point and shoot and the photos were great ./n__label__0 yes , the features are numerous ./n__label__0 the documentation says to extend battery life , do not fill player to capacity ./n__label__0 if you read reviews for the 4 main contenders in this market - the ipod , creative zen , rio karma and iriver ihp - you 'll notice that each has their pros and cons ; none are perfect and you should decide whether you want to take to take the plunge now or later ./n__label__0 having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific ./n__label__0 ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything ... good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion ./n__label__1 i would recommend this player to anyone i know , and you will not be dissapointed ./n__label__0 makes me use it much less than i otherwise would ./n__label__0 the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful  scene  mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc. , are endless ./n__label__0 it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package ./n__label__0 it is connected to an old television set via composite video and analog audio outputs ./n__label__0 well in the beginning i was asking around for mp3 players ./n__label__0 when i hit  menu  it told me ,  playback only ./n__label__0 well , anyway i could go on and on on why this player did n't meet my expectations .. ./n__label__0 there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote ./n__label__0 not all the time , but often enough to be a real problem ./n__label__0 some of my friends had well branded dvd-players but they keep complaining that sometime it stucks and sucks !/n__label__0 as it is , i 'm keeping the machine ./n__label__0 everyone complains about the non-replaceable battery , yet this is the price of sturdy construction ./n__label__0 i guess i 'm just lucky to get a good working unit !/n__label__0 the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )/n__label__0 it does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves ./n__label__0 despite the instructions insisting that the process was fairly automatic , i had to install the usb drivers and the nomad interface software manually ./n__label__0 after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocably that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck ./n__label__0 great colors , pictures and white balance ./n__label__0 i purchased the phone last week and have been using till then . ./n__label__0 i treat the battery well and it has lasted ./n__label__0 the two main reasons i had for getting this model were the range of disks types played and the recommendation of a friend ./n__label__0 ( again this is my first digital camera and maybe that is just how they all are . )/n__label__0 it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light ./n__label__0 i guess that i can not complain since it does not actually claim to play vcd / svcd formats , but others say they can ./n__label__0 i try navigating using the player 's built in menu , and it still would n't work !/n__label__0 this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it ./n__label__0 so i requested and received a zen xtra as a christmas gift ./n__label__0 and have returned both ./n__label__1 before you try to return the player or waste hours calling apex tech support , or run the player over with your car, try these simple troubleshooting ideas first ./n__label__0 unfortunately i bought a player because the ps2 could n't play all my dvds , and now the player can 't play everything ./n__label__0 a tons of reveiws has reported this problem and the same here ./n__label__0 ipod users have to send theirs back and pay $ 100 for a replacement ./n__label__0 but there are faceplates to replace it i guess .../n__label__0 i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended ./n__label__0 here were my requirements in a digital camera :/n__label__0 they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it 's been 2 weeks without a reply ./n__label__0 typically people use 96kbs to 320 kps./n__label__0 the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution ./n__label__0 this phone has many other features , ir , ; just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial ./n__label__0 this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) ./n__label__0 the higher the number the better the quality ( less data compression is used ) and the larger the file size ./n__label__0 i do n't think so ./n__label__0 i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too ./n__label__0 since the front plate is removable to access the battery compartment , aftermarket alternate covers would not be difficult or expensive to make ./n__label__0 i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias ./n__label__1 i would recommend buying one ./n__label__1 here 's something you have to know before you considering about buying this one ./n__label__0 i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife ./n__label__0 after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel ./n__label__0 i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer ./n__label__1 then just forget about all the controls you have on the metz flash head itself and the sca 3102 control panel , because they are all ignored ./n__label__0 amazon has been working with me to refund my money , but they reminded me that i have past the 30 day return policy and this was a courtesy return ./n__label__0 yes , all cameras except g3 were 5mp but i was looking for a lot more than just megapixel power ./n__label__0 the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad ./n__label__0 the software you get with this camera is perfect ./n__label__1 you have to install the software to the computer you 're transferring to , instead of just connecting it with a usb connection ./n__label__0 at least once youve got focus lock , the shutter release lag time for the g3 is about 1/10 of a second , which from what ive read , is better than just about anything else available ./n__label__0 would be really good if they have given an option to stop this autofocussing ./n__label__0 3 . the remote capture and fileviewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing ./n__label__0 construction quality is a difficult item ./n__label__0 they are not wowable good ./n__label__0 this almost made it worth the price alone ./n__label__0 the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap ./n__label__0 hope someone else has better luck !/n__label__0 i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images ./n__label__0 the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint ./n__label__0 the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line ./n__label__0 the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player ./n__label__0 most people probably wanted the ipod before realizing that a vast array of full-featured viable alternatives exist ./n__label__0 i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it !/n__label__0 working for 10 hours with it on  shuffle  totally rocks ! !/n__label__0 also , if i want a family plan , which mean i need tw phones on a plan .. ./n__label__0 i like the way apple is innovative , but let 's face it - they can 't be the only one with an idea to enclose a 2.5  hd within an aluminum case in a stylish package for long , especially after the buzz is out of their little techie pod ./n__label__0 sound quality :/n__label__0 2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic ./n__label__0 4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking ./n__label__0 i wo n't go into the details here , as the online sites ( stevesdigicams , dpreviews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers ./n__label__0 i also did n't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode ./n__label__0 transferred the zens new software onto it in about 10 seconds ./n__label__1 i would not hesitate to purchase this if you are uncertain of the brand name ./n__label__0 my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took !/n__label__0 to summarize , i am using the creative zen as a mobile device ;/n__label__0 it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice ./n__label__0 i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better ./n__label__0 i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds ./n__label__0 anybody can explain that ?/n__label__0 relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots ./n__label__0 i forgot , the case does n't fit ./n__label__0 crappy headphones ./n__label__0 while i am at the store i will definitely get the extended warranty as i have another day or so ( from the purchase date ) to obtain one ./n__label__0 the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable ./n__label__0 - the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones ./n__label__0 the navigion on it can be a little quirky , but still operates better than the zen 's did ./n__label__0 i can 't comment on the quality of the audio , because it was back at the store before i ripped a single cd ./n__label__0 the longest that i have n't charged it was maybe 3 days and that 's turning it off every now and then ./n__label__0 i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size ./n__label__0 4 it has optional lenses like wide angles and extra zooms ./n__label__0 it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light ./n__label__0 the player : it 's silver ./n__label__0 the regular mode in this camera works for 80 % of settings ./n__label__0 6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; it does not charge by usb cable ; this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice ./n__label__0 i bought this last week through amazon ./n__label__0 the picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv ./n__label__0 because of it 's hidden features ( no macrovision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's ./n__label__0 2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre , artist , album , etc. ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information ./n__label__0 i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far ./n__label__0 of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest ./n__label__0 the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player ./n__label__0 buy this camera and savour it ./n__label__0 7 . a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view ./n__label__0 it 's not the end of the world , but a better design sure would be nice ./n__label__0 i have had great experience with amazon , but i will probably not buy electronics any more from them to avoid any future return problems ./n__label__0 - since i wrote the review above in january 2003 , i still love this camera ./n__label__0 enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem ./n__label__0 it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack ./n__label__0 although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent ./n__label__0 just for the heck of it , i took it into my dark kitchen with only indirect light coming in though the door , and the focusing was just fine ./n__label__1 any possible problems should be weighed against the bang-for-the-buck factor , along with the fact that companies like apex seldom have good after-sale support ./n__label__0 the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air ./n__label__0 the flash card memory is more expensive but is very light and compact ./n__label__0 it wo n't play all of my movies ./n__label__0 so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost ./n__label__0 im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button !/n__label__0 what 's going on creative labs ?/n__label__0 one complaint ... the screen is too easily scratched !/n__label__0 i upgraded to a 6610 at my local t-mobile store ./n__label__0 unfortunately , the neutral density filters for the metz flash are no longer available , so the first problem cant easily be solved ./n__label__0 because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos !/n__label__0 2 ) fm transmitter - so you can place the unit in your car and listen to the unit through your car stereo ./n__label__0 i hate apex but love amazon , and i tell everyone ./n__label__0 the radio :/n__label__0 10 great price for all the features ./n__label__0 overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it ./n__label__0 the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on yoursound quality , the sound might crack ./n__label__0 it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait ./n__label__1 i would recommend doing the upgrade to be sure you have the best chance at trouble free operation ./n__label__0 after i took their picture with their camera , they offered to take a picture of us ./n__label__0 getting files onto it is quick and painless ./n__label__1 artist , album and genre are only mp3 tags which are supported buy this player , and if you have 100 artists would be good to have another subcategory ./n__label__0 i tried to take a cd and simply rip it onto a hard drive and then transfer into the player ./n__label__0 i do n't care how it looks and i always drive so the size is not important to me ./n__label__0 the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones ./n__label__0 3 . with low battery , it twice wiped out the entire pictures in the memory chip ./n__label__0 i quickly discovered that the nomad was n't going to work for me ./n__label__0 it is not as good as the samsung phones that i have used earlier ./n__label__0 so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine ./n__label__0 on several different occasions it has displayed  no disc  with a disc inside ./n__label__0 apple 's solution - pay apple another $ 400 + for a new ipod ( less a paltry discount ) ./n__label__0 all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product ./n__label__0 one minor complaint :/n__label__0 i do n't use the vibration , because it is often easier to hear it vibrate then to feel it ./n__label__0 output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv ./n__label__0 reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive ./n__label__0 i received this as a gift for christmas ./n__label__1 if you are going to need a player that is rugged this may not be the one for you ./n__label__0 accept that there will be better devices ( or new generations of these ones ) in a year or two that will cost less ./n__label__0 i also registered the unit online and posted two messages to the apex support person ( there can 't possibly be more than one !/n__label__0 after using it for just a month , i could not play any dvd ./n__label__1 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera ./n__label__0 in all a winning combination ./n__label__0 it looks great - and is loaded with features ./n__label__0 however , the creative software is not real intuitive ./n__label__1 but once youve got your exposure within an acceptable range , the g3 is shown to produce utterly stunning images that i can hardly get with my nikon f100 film camera ./n__label__0 second , the  automatic  sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer ./n__label__0 i myself find this great for when i am at a site i can run to my truck and hook up my modem cable ( 49.99 @ nokiausa.com or t-mobile.com ) press dial up on my laptop ( by the way it is a mac pb 1gz. and in a matter of seconds i can access my email , fax , and the entire web from my truck !/n__label__1 if you are looking for an outstanding camera that can take you from simple to complex , this is it ./n__label__0 finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 ./n__label__0 once again , the sound is awesome , the batterly life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life ./n__label__0 the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera ./n__label__0 while it is true that it will stand on end , it is also easy to knock over that way ./n__label__0 what it lacks for me is n't available on one phone yet , namely gsm850 ( also sometimes known as gsm800 ) , bluetooth and edge ./n__label__0 it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily ./n__label__0 i 've have n't heard about a diagnos or fix for this ./n__label__0 the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones ./n__label__0 so sit back , relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can 't do half the things this one can , and for a fraction of the price !/n__label__0 i had an older camera that was simply a point and shoot camera ./n__label__0 a great new use for that underutilized computer ./n__label__0 hehe , my bad ./n__label__0 2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it ./n__label__0 you can take pictures with the camera held above your head , way down , or beside you with no problem , allowing you to position the camera for the best shot without contorting yourself ./n__label__0 it 's horrible ./n__label__0 having to copy / delete files would be time-consuming and is rendered a non-issue with 40gb of storage ./n__label__0 it puts an end to organizational deficiencies as well as communications and internet , without a bulky phone like the treo or something , which i had to cell because i was so unhappy with it ./n__label__0 ripping your songs and creating playlists could n't be any easier ./n__label__0 extremely convenient ./n__label__0 for the average music listener not expecting much ... this may be a satisfactory mp3 player .../n__label__0 after using it for a few weeks ( the amount of time before the hard drive crashed ) it revealed a few of its shortcommings ./n__label__0 the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily ./n__label__0 the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mls ( real estate broker software ) very well at all ./n__label__0 anyway , i ended up purchasing the lumix ./n__label__0 i find it pretty easy to use ... and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) .. ./n__label__0 3 ) user replaceable battery/n__label__0 i 'll admit that i 'd own an ipod if i had money to burn , but for the money this is a much better buy ./n__label__0 best regards sadoun satellite sales/n__label__0 you 're talking totally different hardware ./n__label__0 almost there ./n__label__0 and should they not know it , they can find it out pretty quick ./n__label__0 i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked ./n__label__0 2 ) scroll button / switch/n__label__0 thankfully amazon has free return shipping !/n__label__0 i purchased this as a christmas gift for my husband ./n__label__0 there are plenty other features that i have n't checked out , but i 'm sure i soon will ./n__label__0 it 's probably good for the health of your ears , however i consistently play it near the high end of the volume range ( and my hearing is fine )./n__label__0 they got the best lens adapter for the g3-better than canon 's ./n__label__0 oh ... and file transfers are fast & easy ./n__label__0 in manual , you can set it to  single af  where it will focus by depressing the shudder button prior to taking the pic ; this is not really a hinderance , you just have to be familiar with its menus and features ./n__label__0 nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www.crazycellphone.com/n__label__0 the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing ./n__label__0 however , it has failed to deliver on quality ./n__label__0 it goes nicely with my apex 27  in my bedroom ./n__label__0 the software has n't been a hassle for me at all ./n__label__0 i 've compared this phone to others such as 6100 , siemens sl55 ./n__label__0 the aff feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal ./n__label__0 every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes ./n__label__0 there are six default settings ( off , vivid , sepia , neutral , low sharpening , b & w ) as well as a ' custom effect ' that allows you to control sharpening , contrast and saturation ./n__label__0 i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work !/n__label__0 i did n't had any problem till now ./n__label__0 autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all ./n__label__0 the service from the supplier was exceptional ./n__label__0 one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software ./n__label__0 but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it !/n__label__0 my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27  screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17  monitor ./n__label__0 also , when i installed the software , it said that windows xp had n't approved something with the drivers , etc - and that continuing it install may cause instability ./n__label__0 i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n't a big problem ./n__label__0 this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues ./n__label__1 save money on the long run - buy something decent once instead of buying cheap every month ./n__label__0 the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price ./n__label__0 that 's a rare and valuable feature ./n__label__0 the title says it all .../n__label__0 hence i decided to spring for a point-and-shoot digicam that that would have features that would let me get around their inherent limitations ./n__label__0 since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , irivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) ./n__label__0 i 'm starting to listen to cd 's that i have n't listened to in years now that i have them all handy in one place ./n__label__0 as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale ./n__label__0 the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited ./n__label__0 there are funny little ridges on the dvd that look like the slice of a tree trunk !/n__label__0 i have done a lot of research before i decided to buy the nomad zen xtra ./n__label__0 whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio ./n__label__0 the only drawbacks that i have noticed :/n__label__0 the player kept displaying  no disc  , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ # * !/n__label__0 it 's a very intuitive program ./n__label__0 i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) ./n__label__1 so all you do is stick a pin or something small in the reset button & you 're golden ./n__label__0 i currrently have service with t-mobile , verizon , and t-mobile ./n__label__0 the songs do n't play one after another like on a cd ./n__label__0 i would like album order for my live albums and was just wondering ./n__label__0 i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept ./n__label__0 after doing a hands-on comparison between the nikon coolpix 5700 and sony dsc-f 717 ( both of which lack the quality , feel , or features of the g3 ) , i ultimately chose the g3 because of its outstanding image quality ( resolution and coloration are superior ) ./n__label__0 the photos she took are better than the results i got from my nikon slr and range of lenses !/n__label__0 short of the eos range from canon or the d100s from nikon ( both slrs ) ./n__label__0 - the unit is easy to use and intuitive ./n__label__0 i had apex regular ( non-progressive ) dvd-player for two years ./n__label__0 for other problems go to http://www.apexdigitalinc.com/support.asp/n__label__0 i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed ./n__label__1 if this doesnt bring back the picture, try pressing this button without playing a dvd ./n__label__0 it is very simple to import via iphoto 2 and then move them to photoshop ./n__label__0 i 've tried several dvd 's and even new ones do the same thing ./n__label__0 the only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode ./n__label__0 and does n't need to be placed in a cabinet like the 1201 does ./n__label__0 i hope that amazon will let me trade it for a different , more trusted brand of dvd player ./n__label__0 they look fantastic ./n__label__0 a good player at a great price with terrible software that makes ripping and transferring way more difficult than it should be ./n__label__0 after messing with it at a store i noticed how bad the i-pod was ./n__label__0 if you 're like me , that will definitely make you pause ./n__label__0 the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n't come in the overused blue ./n__label__0 like many others , i had not abused the product , and had tried to take care of it ./n__label__0 you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division ./n__label__0 not sure , if customer rep. did not know the product exactly , it is still new or they just give an anser which users would like to hear ./n__label__1 ensure you get a larger flash , 128 or 256 , some are selling with the larger flash , 32mb will do in a pinch but you 'll quickly want a larger flash card as with any of the 4mp cameras ./n__label__1 for the money , get a better quality player ./n__label__0 i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least ./n__label__0 i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites ./n__label__0 the phone does have voice dialing according to amazon & t-mobile and nokia ./n__label__0 the cd will be classified into a number of genres , and in multidisk sets , you can get separate classifications for different disks by the same artist and the same performance ./n__label__0 i am a nikon fan , and owned and used slr nikon fe , n50 and n90s for many many years ./n__label__0 i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great ./n__label__0 the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use ./n__label__0 in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset ./n__label__0 well i decided to get this one ./n__label__0 i was impressed by this very inexpensive player.for the first three hours , and then it died ./n__label__0 there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful ./n__label__0 3 . it 's a hazard in the car ./n__label__0 imagine my shock - and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex ./n__label__1 if that is for you then pay the money , learn from the experience and you 'll be a more informed buyer when you buy device # 2 ./n__label__0 that 's why you have these things that can be keychain size ./n__label__0 it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps ./n__label__0 the reason so many is that i am a contractor and all of my subs have these carriers and i can benifit from the mobile to mobile features that companies are now offering !/n__label__0 i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n't had any problems ./n__label__0 this camera will stay with me for years !/n__label__1 dont let the bad reviews of the software change your mind ./n__label__0 what the heck is up with the 2600 ./n__label__0 even though they might be smaller many people seem to have alot of problems with them ./n__label__0 the flap completely covers the screen because there is no window to see it ./n__label__0 focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange ./n__label__0 had i not been in such a hurry to load cds , i would have spotted them sooner ./n__label__0 i wish it would do the same for movies , but that 's one rare / cool feature you will have to forgo ./n__label__0 my opinions :/n__label__0 the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy ./n__label__0 the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me ./n__label__0 i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome ./n__label__0 the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk ./n__label__0 many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective ./n__label__1 but do not assume , as i did , that the g3 has the same ability as [ your current film camera ] to stop the moment you choose ./n__label__0 prior to my switch to t-mobile , sprint was my service provider ./n__label__0 being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable ./n__label__0 loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well ./n__label__0 i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision ./n__label__0 no more annoying series of beeps ./n__label__0 i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful ./n__label__0 i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus ./n__label__0 i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptible period of time for something to work ./n__label__0 controls are a bit awkward ./n__label__0 it was always after it finished a process or something , so it did n't cause any file errors ./n__label__0 aight den bumpy ?/n__label__0 this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is !/n__label__0 ( i had no problems since i did this but there seem to be a couple of very bitter reviews further down - maybe they did not do this or maybe there are some very sad ipod owners since they all recomend it instead ) ./n__label__0 unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming ./n__label__0 the button on the remote to switch from pal to ntsc was undoubtedly my problem ./n__label__0 i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet ./n__label__0 the second one is up and running ./n__label__0 my choices at that moment were to manually re-tag my music or re-rip using mediasource ./n__label__0 this did not give me enough control ./n__label__0 after reading several other reviews this appears to be relatively common ./n__label__0 all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n't done it since ./n__label__0 and since the current language selection was english (even though i think only the menu supports chinese , and not the track info ) ... all it saw were  ?  s and even though the songs had different names in chinese ../n__label__0 we did n't get to use it again for over a month ( sad , i know ) ./n__label__1 here 's a hint : go to nokia.com and get their pc suite and a connection cable if you dont have irda or bluetooth ./n__label__0 this is a wonderful camera ./n__label__0 the powershot g3 is a great camera ./n__label__0 it took over 2 months and repeated follow-up to get it replaced ./n__label__0 -- > does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library ./n__label__0 i can 't speak to its long-term reliability , as i 've only had the apex ad2600 for a little over a week at this point ./n__label__0 3 battery has to be removed to recharge ./n__label__0 friends of mine who own apex tv sets are also all very pleased ./n__label__0 they have n't got all the bugs worked out just yet ./n__label__0 after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed ./n__label__0 in reality , these are the only drawbacks this camera has , much less than many other models !/n__label__0 it is a beast ./n__label__0 i was trying to decide whether or not i should go with the 40 gb ipod or this 30 gb zen xtra ./n__label__0 anyway , im gon na go find dennis now , have a nice day ! ! !/n__label__0 i would replace them with some better sounding and more comfortable phones ./n__label__0 i think there is a good chance i will try to get a samsung flip camera phone next year ./n__label__0 you can easily access ur files , and easily fill in the id3 tags , which can take a while with a big collection of music , but if your not lazy , you will do it without a problem ./n__label__0 it can get pretty lonely out there ./n__label__0 better actually cause my carpet looks clean , lol ./n__label__0 apex is made in usa and is one of the underrated brands out there ./n__label__0 the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god ./n__label__0 in my case , the bill was $ 81 , about a third of what i paid for it ./n__label__1 overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it ./n__label__1 try to buy a tripod and that should solve some of those problems ./n__label__0 this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my countertop and also to listen to my old 8-track records ./n__label__0 now i may buy two !/n__label__0 1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's  unspecified  ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers ./n__label__0 i like to play my music by album and the nomad jukebox plays the songs in the same order as the actual cd ./n__label__0 b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage ./n__label__0 again , though , it has only been used sparingly ./n__label__0 while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability ./n__label__0 1 ) frame freezes and the family yells ,  dad ! somethings wrong with the dvd player ! come quick !/n__label__0 like i said , when the moment is gone , it is gone ./n__label__0 you can use the scene modes , or fine tune the options , i. you can change the iso level , shutter speed , etc./n__label__0 some movies it played yesterday , it wo n't play today ./n__label__0 also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore  the  when it lists the cds in alphabetical order ./n__label__0 i have n't quite figured this one out yet , but it is probably operator error ./n__label__0 great features . ./n__label__0 however , it does n't register instantly as a hard drive like other players ./n__label__0 range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography ./n__label__0 so far the dvd works so i hope it does n't break down like the reviews i 've read ./n__label__0 thank you !/n__label__0 for a 250 dollar player , they could have thrown in nice headphones ./n__label__0 i called creative and they said to send it in and they would decide if it in warranty ./n__label__0 ipod has no stop button ; when new users mention this ipod veterans call it  unnecessary  and  so 20th century  ./n__label__0 i purchased the extended warranty ( something i almost never do ) when i returned the unit to get the replacement ./n__label__0 the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc./n__label__0 this really is a great little phone ; its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny !/n__label__0 however , if you are keen , you can attach a camera to this phone ./n__label__0 it defaulted to unchangeable email ./n__label__0 excellent range of metering options as well ./n__label__0 the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use ./n__label__0 the t610 can also compose music , a feature which most wo n't use ./n__label__0 4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! )/n__label__0 no more wasted time and money developing rolls of pic 's for just a couple of keepers ./n__label__0 forget about it ./n__label__0 i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players ./n__label__0 now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk ./n__label__0 great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !/n__label__0 i have owned motorola , panasonic and nokia phones over the last 8 years and generally prefer nokia , this phone combines many of the best nokia features , the only feature missing for me is the voice recognition ./n__label__0 now , i thought it 's time to upgrade ./n__label__0 karma gets consistently good reviews for sound quality and connectivity from its docking device , which has rca output jacks and ethernet jacks for connectivity ./n__label__0 this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod ./n__label__0 this is nothing new , every mp3 player , memory card , etc. , used for digital media today has some kind of preloaded operating software on it ./n__label__0 here 's why :/n__label__0 i was able to improve things a bit by using the units equalizer and boosting the base ./n__label__0 overall i 'm happy with my toy ./n__label__0 navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs ./n__label__0 i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly ./n__label__0 i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar ./n__label__0 i 'm live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators ./n__label__0 2 . the speed is noticeably slower than canon , especially so with flashes on ./n__label__0 it was marked up increadably high compared to other models ( almost $ 500 for a 30gb ) , and theres was nothing about it that made it worth that much money ./n__label__0 the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use ./n__label__0 the 60 ct-4 flash head can actually be reversed 180 degrees and then tilted , enabling you to bounce the flash off the walls behind you ./n__label__0 the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors ./n__label__0 i was immediately interested in the 6610 ./n__label__0 it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket ./n__label__0 personally i found the integrated digital camera of the t610 to be very nice ./n__label__0 i also got a ur-e 4 step down ring adapter , lc-e 900 lens cap , and the nikon 28mm filter set ./n__label__0 i got this a while ago knowing nothing about it ./n__label__0 this is a very nice phone , but there is no warranty on it ./n__label__0 it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button ./n__label__0 first of all i have been a big nokia fan and have been upgrading my cell phones about once a year ( right after the release contract is over ) ./n__label__0 great phone .. ./n__label__0 the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot ./n__label__0 so i 'm screwed ./n__label__0 yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway ./n__label__0 you can edit the genres once the songs are on the play if you decide to re-classify things later ./n__label__0 deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 )./n__label__0 her main focus was having a camera that is easy to understand and use ./n__label__0 sure , i adjusted the film speed to 400 ./n__label__0 this would not be a great problem if you did n't have so much info to scroll through on a regular basis ./n__label__0 it 's going back today , &#38; being replaced with the new samsung x105 ./n__label__0 luckily i also have a ps2 which can play those episodes the player can 't ./n__label__0 also , very light and portable ./n__label__0 i 've got 1200 songs on it now and about 4000 more to go ./n__label__0 ipod clearly has the most buzz ./n__label__0 unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs ./n__label__0 there 's really very little about g3 images to criticize ./n__label__0 a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging --- how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )/n__label__0 i love the storage in this thing ./n__label__0 the zen has no stop button ./n__label__0 this effect is increased when one buys and uses a telephoto doubler ./n__label__0 i can only confirm what other customers have said - crap !/n__label__0 however for me , i occasionally use the view finder and trying to frame in a picture with the lens blocking the view is too much ./n__label__0 with apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it ./n__label__0 it is generally overpriced a little bit but you get what you are paying for ./n__label__0 each of the 4 lasted less than six months ./n__label__0 there are not a lot of good options out there ./n__label__0 as mentioned above i broke the player within the 1st 10 days ./n__label__0 this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product ./n__label__0 the reception and sound quality are top-notch ./n__label__0 i really have no complaints over this unit ./n__label__0 i 'm not sure why people have problems with either the interface of the nomad , or the software that comes with the unit ./n__label__0 the interface used could be better designed ./n__label__0 additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screensaver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc. )/n__label__0 is a lot better compared to the toy phone design of the nokia 7210 with its cheap feel ./n__label__0 my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n't have them ./n__label__0 i think the ipod versus zen typifies differences between apple and win machines ./n__label__0 one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low ./n__label__0 some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to ./n__label__0 it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist ./n__label__0 got a great deal from a reputable seller ./n__label__0 songs are recognized automatically by id3 tags , which at first i was against since i had organized my files by folder with a previous player from iriver ./n__label__0 this item broke just two weeks after i gave it to my kids for christmas ./n__label__0 it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping ./n__label__0 one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does ./n__label__0 1 no direct firewire to the camera ./n__label__0 apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy ./n__label__0 still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper !/n__label__0 if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly ./n__label__0 this meant that i had to take all my cds and do in a fairly short period of time what i had done over a year at work ./n__label__0 nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price ./n__label__0 - the cover that came with it did n't fit very well/n__label__0 despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box !/n__label__1 i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime ./n__label__0 the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to ./n__label__0 i like the size and weight of this little critter ./n__label__0 but you do n't have to be ./n__label__0 size and style :/n__label__0 connecting the same outputs to a video card in my computer , there was sound but still no picture ./n__label__0 you can always spend more money to get a better one ./n__label__0 all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift ./n__label__0 nokia 6610 ( sound quality ) the phone is great with very cool features &#38; options , but comparing to my older motorola phone , it gets a failing grade in speaker quality ./n__label__0 the fact that this model would play jpeg slideshows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting ./n__label__0 it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep ./n__label__0 although i tried contacting amazon to see if they can do anything , the replies i got were inept as if they had n't taken time to read the complaint ./n__label__0 after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( fkor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them.the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support ./n__label__0 there are a lot of cool websites with games and midi ringtones to download for free ./n__label__0 4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras ./n__label__0 easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot ./n__label__0 the reviews of this product can be roughly divided into two groups : ( 1 ) those who have had the product for a few weeks and ( 2 ) those have had the product for a few months ./n__label__0 it 's a dedicated music playing device , anyway , so this serves it better ./n__label__0 the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging ./n__label__0 i was surprised by t-mobile 's service ./n__label__0 most of the dvds i was trying were fairly new and were in great condition ./n__label__0 i bought the apex ad-2600 because of the ability to play jpegs and it seemed like it was the most bang for the buck ./n__label__0 t-mobile was a pretty good server ./n__label__0 i use my own mid-priced headphones rather than the enclosed earbuds ./n__label__0 the upgrade went smoothly and was easy to do if you can follow directions ./n__label__0 i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs ./n__label__0 4 ) the great thing about digital , in general , is that you can generally see the results of your exposure settings on the lcd screen before you take the picture , not two weeks later when you get the film developed ./n__label__0 look / design :/n__label__0 the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile ./n__label__0 this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways ./n__label__1 if you are n't into paying $ x00 to learn and experiment , or the cons outweigh the pros , then wait a year or so ./n__label__0 and amazon.com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ?/n__label__0 there 's a dent on the upper-back-right and lower-back-right corners ... not too obvious unless you 're up close ./n__label__0 for work , we use them in the field often , and they hold up really well ./n__label__0 4 an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery 's out is not included , although one can be purchased separately ./n__label__0 good thing i got a replacement plan ./n__label__0 i believe the napster mp3 player has this feature ./n__label__0 it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx ./n__label__0 i wish canon would work out some way for that issue ./n__label__0 even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio ./n__label__0 the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --/n__label__0 i got this phone in t-mobile 's current customer retention program for very little money and no contract renewal ./n__label__0 that 's all for now ./n__label__0 the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well ./n__label__0 that was annoying ./n__label__1 this is not the unit you should use if you go jogging anyway ./n__label__0 the software failed repeatedly ./n__label__0 i did everything i could , and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader ./n__label__0 however , the ad-2600 does n't have this feature ( for now ) ./n__label__0 overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !/n__label__0 i 've bought 3 apex dvd players now ./n__label__0 it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video ./n__label__0 i love the quality of the pictures ./n__label__0 i use mine at the office , in the car ( with a cassette adapter ) , and will be taking it on a flight back east for the holiday ./n__label__0 we 've purchased 3 universal remotes so far-all claiming to work  apex  dvd players and none worked ./n__label__0 even if there happened to be identical track titles on the same disc , you could still edit the file name manually and get them both onto the player ./n__label__0 after playing with this little device , i do n't know why i would look at an ipod with the same space when it costs $ 500 and i got mine for a little more than half that price !/n__label__0 same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing ./n__label__0 i purchased this unit 3 months back and i think the unit knew when my warrenty expires ./n__label__0 after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc. creative 's online support was no help at all ./n__label__0 its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake ./n__label__0 based on the cameras features and about dozen online reviews , this one seemed like the best all round deal ./n__label__1 my recommendation is to wait on buying one from this company as they will surely get sent a message of many returned dvd players after christmas 2003 ./n__label__0 simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point ./n__label__0 i read reviews , compared specs , and visited user forums ./n__label__0 the s105 ( samsung ) has a beautiful big display ( 65,000 colors ) , and i can 't say much about the motorolla ./n__label__0 what a mistake !/n__label__0 since the zen xtra does not use a folder structure , the  duplicate name  problem stems from the actual file name , not from the song 's title / artist / album ./n__label__0 hope i helped !/n__label__0 after @ 3 months , it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds ./n__label__0 otherwise , you 'll have to mess around a lot with filenames inside the ( decent ) nomad explorer , which is not fun at all ./n__label__0 you have to ask yourself ,  how much money is dissapointment worth ?/n__label__0 i then played it through my ps2 and there was no problem there either ./n__label__0 a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop/n__label__0 the objections of the naysayers almost caused me to purchase a different camera , but , in the end , i figured i 'd give the g3 a try ./n__label__0 not an urgent issue , as it still works .. ./n__label__0 what a disappointment !/n__label__0 i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3.5 ) , but unforutnately , i am returning it ./n__label__0 the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good ./n__label__0 but after 10 days , the sound worked , but the video quit working ./n__label__0 because this camera is beautiful ./n__label__0 there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board ./n__label__0 frequent signal searches eat up battery power ./n__label__0 after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it ./n__label__0 the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal ./n__label__0 alright , well i read alot of these reviews , and i read alot of bad and good things about this player ./n__label__0 it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it ./n__label__0 all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well ./n__label__0 great battery life , perfect size , but a tid bit quieter than i would like ./n__label__0 short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel ./n__label__0 i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :/n__label__0 sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference ./n__label__0 then sorting the files is easy as pie ./n__label__0 it was impossible to do so before ./n__label__0 this is a benefit for many reasons ; one being just for appearance , your pants wo n't be bulging with this phone in your pocket ./n__label__0 the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent ./n__label__0 this camera is closest to perfect than any other digicam that is 4-5 megapixel ./n__label__0 i doubt i will use half of the storage capacity , but you never know ./n__label__0 2 ) not very ergonomical - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )/n__label__0 prior to christmas , it seems the reviews were very good but after that it seems the reviews went bad !/n__label__0 weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; it does n't show the complete filenames of mp3s with really long names ; you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc. ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] ./n__label__0 so it was no loss ./n__label__0 the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda wolla ./n__label__0 it lasts about 5 days otherwise and has lasted up to 10 when i was making very few calls ./n__label__0 awesome feature ./n__label__0 even better , ipod integrates perfectly with itunes so that managing music is a snap ./n__label__0 yes the ipod is smaller , but not $ 200 worth , which is the premium you 'll pay for an equivalent capacity model ./n__label__0 * does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio )./n__label__0 i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) ./n__label__0 i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional ./n__label__0 i just got it today and have tried to verify the claims of other reviewers ./n__label__0 nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby ./n__label__0 it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine ./n__label__0 the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras ./n__label__0 it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player !/n__label__0 feels solid in hand ./n__label__0 the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now ./n__label__0 those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use ./n__label__0 the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen ./n__label__0 it did lock up on me a couple of times ./n__label__0 not only was i was shopping for a camera that would suit my casual and artistic photographic needs , i had to keep in mind that my fiance wanted to use this camera as well ./n__label__0 sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod ./n__label__0 only the cheap and poor would buy one ./n__label__0 it is small ./n__label__1 if you want a sexy , cool , accessory-availible mp3 player , by all means , get an ipod for a hundred dollars more ( or one for the same price that holds 1/3 of the music ) ./n__label__0 mixed bag i guess but the price was right ./n__label__0 1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want ./n__label__0 like others have mentioned , you can manage to hear new things in songs even though they 're on lower bit levels ./n__label__0 it is a teeny phone , so it is hard to put a big mechanism in ./n__label__0 1 . i achieved my basic objective ; my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more ./n__label__0 before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there ./n__label__0 before anyone says hey you have n't used the product , i have , my friend received one for christmas instead of an ipod and has since envied me for my vastly superior product ./n__label__1 rip your tunes at 192kb if you like , alhthough 128kb sounds just dandy , and you 'll get more tunes stored on it ./n__label__0 in other words , to locate a track using the software on the computer and add it to a playlist , you must know the name of the cd it appears on and then find the track by locating the location of the unlisted cd by looking for tracks that appear on it ./n__label__0 the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any ./n__label__0 for those who are used to brass cameras that can be dropped , picking up a camera like the g3 is an unnerving experience ./n__label__0 update : the finish is more  mirror  than silver -- and i like it !/n__label__0 one big difference between the 1201 and the 2600 models is that the 2600 model is virtually silent ./n__label__0 structurally , everything is secure and it wo n't fall apart on you ./n__label__0 the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this ./n__label__0 i have not been disappointed with my purchase ./n__label__0 features and looks this dvd player is overpriced had it come with sony or one of the other top brand names ./n__label__0 one stopped working in february and the other in march ./n__label__0 the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery ./n__label__0 most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy ./n__label__0 i knew nothing about dvds before this but with this machine i figured it all out very quickly ./n__label__0 the two cameras are very similar in functionality and pricing ./n__label__0 this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly ./n__label__0 use this for 18 months every day and see what happens , or look at a 2 year old electric razor and see if it holds the same charge as the first day you had it ) ./n__label__0 even if it has n't expired , creative is likely to claim that the owner caused the damage which in turn voids the warranty ./n__label__0 i do n't really like bounce ./n__label__0 unfortunatly it was dropped and damaged a year after i bought it ./n__label__0 you can send it in , but i would n't count on ever seeing it or a replacement again ./n__label__0 if you do any research into digital cameras , you 'll quickly find that this camera is just about the best value out there ./n__label__0 not good if you 're taking this traveling ./n__label__0 it 's worth it ./n__label__0 when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; it is unbelievably small and oh , so light ./n__label__0 there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc ./n__label__0 80 % of the features on here you will not get by spending $ 100 on a sony or panasonic ./n__label__0 we ordered two apex ad-2600 's for our family for christmas - finally decided to join the rest of the world and watch dvd 's - well ./n__label__0 the battery recharges ral fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice ./n__label__1 but for $ 49.99 go get one !/n__label__0 that way i could keep it in the case all the time ./n__label__0 this camera has significantly more noise at iso 100 than the nikon 4500 ./n__label__0 the sound quality is very good ./n__label__0 i 'm very glad i did ./n__label__0 most of our emplyees use this model phone ./n__label__0 2 ) storage capacity/n__label__0 as i also leave you with this review i would like to thank you for reading it ./n__label__0 what task do they perform ?/n__label__0 i bought 2 of these phones 2 months ago for myself and my girlfriend ./n__label__0 did i mention i 've already dropped it once ?/n__label__0 you know why ?/n__label__0 but after trying many adjustments , the camera remains unresponsive when compared to any film-based camera ./n__label__0 i pulled out our old non-progressive scan toshiba , hooked it back-up and the  finding nemo  dvd works fine ./n__label__0 the nomad jukebox zen xtra is a very good mp3 player but the software is it gets hurt ./n__label__0 i am very pleased with the apex ad2600.it plays just about anything you put in the drawer ./n__label__0 think you need to pay a fortune for a good qulaity dvd player ?/n__label__0 the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective )/n__label__0 sent mine back ./n__label__0 it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up ./n__label__0 while it is an alternative to the ipod and one of the few viable ones its just that , an alternative and why would anyone seek an alternative to something that really needs no alternative choice because theres nothing wrong and everything right with it ./n__label__0 5 hours max. i did it like this/n__label__0 so i contacted customer service at creative , but they said ,  if the product seems broken , we cannot help ,  or something to that effect ./n__label__0 gee ... thanks a lot creative ./n__label__0 it was not easy sharing one with my teen age kid ./n__label__0 5 . the zen does not have a stop button !/n__label__0 i make photographs at work , and so wanted a camera good enough to compare with what i use professionally ./n__label__0 hard drives ( this is what most ipods have - and just about all mp3 players over 3-5 gb of memory ) ./n__label__0 i tried to play the song three times , with no success ./n__label__0 still i am a little suprised that canon did not correct this design flaw before releasing the camera ./n__label__0 and then it just froze and now i 'm out $ 300 for their piece of junk ./n__label__0 simply configure the mediasource software ( or windows media player , or your ripper-du-jour ) to create file names that include artist and ( especially ) album names in addition to track names ./n__label__0 yes , i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay ./n__label__0 personally i believe it even outperforms the g2 in terms of less haze and astonishingly real colors ./n__label__0 the buttons and interface are very easy to use ./n__label__0 the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it ./n__label__0 this is my second digital camera , though i also use one at work and have some experience with several nikon and canon models ./n__label__0 i bought the 2600 because it plays everything !/n__label__0 zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod ./n__label__0 me , i am going with a leica minilux ( the g3 was replacing mine which was stolen ) ./n__label__0 technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! ! ! ! i love this phone ! ! !/n__label__0 i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood ./n__label__1 if you want to be a poser and follow the herd , mooooooh , then buy the i-pod ./n__label__0 i 've been looking to buy a digital camera for a long time and v = finally decided that now was the time ./n__label__1 if you really need to save , buy this thing on amazon , they eventually gave me a full refund ./n__label__0 worth every penny !/n__label__0 cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners ./n__label__0 for three months , i 've researched the internet and magazines , queried various sales personnel , and took hands-on in-store test drives ./n__label__0 i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase ./n__label__0 zennx hopefully will gain market share and prompt arrogant apple to lower prices and enable consumers to replace the battery ./n__label__0 i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email ./n__label__0 if you have any multi-disc box sets , you 'll notice that the artist 's name , album name , and genre will often change with every disc ./n__label__0 i purchased this player last week ./n__label__0 its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen ./n__label__0 the rate plans are also very good , at least for me ./n__label__0 that 's a huge difference ... especially in this price range ./n__label__0 operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie lebovitz , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store ./n__label__0 the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :/n__label__0 the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy ./n__label__0 and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 ./n__label__0 honestly , i love this player ./n__label__1 although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon ./n__label__0 hope to get my refund in a timely manner ./n__label__0 i can 't imagine why i would spend hundreds of dollars more to have an ipod ./n__label__0 i simply love this feature ./n__label__0 but who wants the wires involved ./n__label__0 for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages ./n__label__0 4 ) it did play my jpeg photos but wow , trying to figure it out was really something !/n__label__0 the battery life seems good , takes very lttle time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs ./n__label__0 the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected ./n__label__0 but at least youre starting with the most photorealistic images ive ever seen from a camera ./n
