__label__0 each of the 4 lasted less than six months ./n__label__0 8mb for a camera like this is a joke ./n__label__0 looking at the glowing reviews from people that have had this for a week or two , i kind of wish people would wait until they 've had a product a little while to review it ./n__label__0 if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order ./n__label__0 right now , i 'm researching for an inexpensive slave flash unit that 's designed for digital cameras ./n__label__0 even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out ./n__label__0 what kind of product goes out within a month ?/n__label__0 it does n't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n't generally have firewire cards themselves ./n__label__0 i looked at both the nikon coolpix 5700 and the canon g3 , and decided on the g3 due both to ergonomics ( much more comfortable to hold and use ) and the price ./n__label__0 one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does ./n__label__0 the canon allows you to change lenses , and it accepts the ibm microdrive ( type ii compact flash ) , so you can have up to 1 gigabyte of storage ./n__label__0 the second one was the 2500 which i think is better than the 2600 because it has more features such as karoake which i do use sometimes for parties ./n__label__0 i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) ./n__label__0 furher it contains a card reader , a flash card folder for up to 8 cards , a lense cleaning rag , and an ac adapter , which is very helpful when working in an  outlet environment  ./n__label__0 once you start sending files , it 'll continue until it 's done or it hits a song that has the same title as another song ... at which point you can skip , skip all , replace , replace all , or cancel ./n__label__0 this thing kicks mighty apple butt !/n__label__0 their website does not show it as a compatible phone , and should i try to access the game downloads on t-zones the system returns an error message saying my phone is not supported ./n__label__0 it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman ./n__label__0 my opinions :/n__label__0 i purchased the extended warranty ( something i almost never do ) when i returned the unit to get the replacement ./n__label__0 you have to skip to the next track when your hated song comes up with the ipod ./n__label__0 the vibrate setting is loud !/n__label__0 unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds. even though they were not damaged in any way ./n__label__0 yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range ./n__label__0 maybe more competitors will bring out similar products ./n__label__0 hopefully , this player will out sell the ridculously over-hyped i-pod ./n__label__0 they were n't busy enough to charge the credit card , though !/n__label__0 i have always known nokia to provide me with good games on their phones ./n__label__0 able to use service in another country :/n__label__1 they are all free if you get a new account anyway , but stick to t-mobile if you are going to use your phone overseas because t-mobile actually allows you to unlock your simm cards so that you can buy simm cards cheap from other nations and plug into your phone when you are doing some international travelling ./n__label__0 sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan't up to the task ./n__label__0 this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks ./n__label__0 the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away ./n__label__0 this thing seriously is a good player though ./n__label__0 let me quote a customer service rep from one of the authorized apex service locations in my state ( they only service apex tv 's , not dvd players ) :/n__label__0 sent mine back ./n__label__0 but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; an exceptional close-up shooting capability ./n__label__0 we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome ./n__label__0 i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough ./n__label__0 the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; there are tons of features i have n't even gotten to ./n__label__0 in short , i have a new slr with an expensive lens and several film point and shoots ./n__label__0 let 's face it - when you want to watch a movie you want to see a picture ./n__label__0 but they offer only a 3-month warranty ( on all of their players , including the zen xtra ) ./n__label__0 this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) ./n__label__0 picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm ./n__label__0 consider it for a future gift too !/n__label__0 7 . a new photostich software for stiching your pics into a panoramic view ./n__label__0 a great buy ./n__label__0 i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer !/n__label__0 audio is excellent ./n__label__1 so all you do is stick a pin or something small in the reset button & you 're golden ./n__label__0 3 ) 4x zoom is nice/n__label__0 i cannot say enough good things about the people who answer the phones ./n__label__0 my personal favorite is the karma ( i currently own a karma , a zen usb 2.0 , a philips hdd100 , and an upgraded 60 gig archos jukebox recorder )./n__label__0 i dare you to surf the net and find the code ./n__label__0 if it were not for that i would have given it 4 ./n__label__0 third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer ./n__label__0 to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod ./n__label__0 it did lock up on me a couple of times ./n__label__0 the  scene  mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a  regular  setting ./n__label__0 i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperature priority , light metering adjustments , etc. , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear ./n__label__1 do n't buy this camera if you are not going to purchase a 128 megabyte card ./n__label__0 creative software stinks ./n__label__0 you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) ./n__label__0 i wish it would do the same for movies , but that 's one rare / cool feature you will have to forgo ./n__label__0 drop if just a few inches on a hard surface and the faceplate pops off ( but not if it 's in its case ) ./n__label__0 alright , well i read alot of these reviews , and i read alot of bad and good things about this player ./n__label__0 the menus are very easy to navigate ./n__label__0 those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use ./n__label__0 so if you have xp , be prepared for this and do n't be alarmed ./n__label__0 the nomad can hold any type of file , not just mp3 , so you can use it as a portable hard disk ./n__label__0 also , i downloaded the latest firmware upgrade and software updates ./n__label__0 it is transferes a song in about 2 seconds ./n__label__0 way less expensive than the ipod ./n__label__0 i 'm live in brazil and i need very to buy this product without a plan to use in here in other operators ./n__label__1 this is a camera you will need to study and use in order to fully exploit its many features ./n__label__0 3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing ./n__label__0 strengths are well listed by other reviewers ./n__label__0 i 've bought the very expensive sanyo 5500/vm4500 -- which i love -- and i 'm okay with my services ./n__label__0 yup , right back for a refund !/n__label__0 i figure that is at least three years off , and i am getting impatient ./n__label__0 what it lacks for me is n't available on one phone yet , namely gsm850 ( also sometimes known as gsm800 ) , bluetooth and edge ./n__label__0 i should point out that the new rio karma is now down to about $ 280 and is reviewed readily as being as good as ( and better in some areas ) the ipod ./n__label__0 prior to my switch to t-mobile , sprint was my service provider ./n__label__1 you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus ./n__label__0 it is not perfect though ./n__label__0 the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it ./n__label__0 a couple of online camera review sites were extremely helpful , as they provided complete exhaustive reviews of nearly every camera made , plus provided a great number of high resolution sample images to compare amongst the models ./n__label__1 100 % perfect if you put some thought and time into reading the manual before you take the photos ./n__label__0 i do n't have a dvd + r to try/n__label__0 the dive , the kick , the blow-out-the-candles moments are , to me , the reason for cameras ./n__label__0 if i had to do this again , i might get the 40gb zen ./n__label__1 if you have the money and need 40 gb , this is the player for you ./n__label__0 the higher the number the better the quality ( less data compression is used ) and the larger the file size ./n__label__0 has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range ./n__label__0 and really this is the best phone one could have ./n__label__0 i am using kingston 512mb cf which works great and is very fast ./n__label__0 eg 60 $ for a plastic box to hold 4 aaa batteries to increase the use time past 6-8 hrs ( reviewers figures )/n__label__0 when shopping for digital cameras i looked at the nikon cp5700 , olympus c5050 , nikon cp5000 , and the canon g3 ./n__label__0 excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures ./n__label__0 with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) ./n__label__0 nokia 6610 ( sound quality ) the phone is great with very cool features &#38; options , but comparing to my older motorola phone , it gets a failing grade in speaker quality ./n__label__0 creative is talking about updating it via firmware , however after following some while the descussion groups for nomad players , looks like creative represents mostly bug fixes in their firmware updates , not too much of new features ./n__label__0 i always shoot using the lcd panel ./n__label__0 4 ) a set of speakers and a wireless transmitter are accessories that will add to your player 's usability ( the latter will allow you to play it on your car radio , home receiver , etc. )/n__label__0 it is an extremely cool gizmo ./n__label__0 i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 ./n__label__0 and man ... i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player ... because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title ../n__label__0 the nomad is only sligtly larger than an ipod ./n__label__0 a dock is unnecessary as the charger and usb cable do the necessary ./n__label__0 i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him ./n__label__0 a sliding old fashioned volume knob would also have been easier than the digital version that was included ./n__label__0 there 's no so-called background hiss that i 've noticed , at least so far ./n__label__0 perhaps this experience will teach me not to buy  off  brands ./n__label__0 apex 's website is down and they wo n't answer their phone ./n__label__0 any film zoom p and s would have given superior results with a minimal effort ./n__label__0 so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine ./n__label__0 but once in a while , i run up against it 's major flaw :/n__label__0 the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) ./n__label__0 i did n't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase !/n__label__0 disgusted with myself after i found the phone in the bottom of the washing machine , i was about to throw it away when one of my fellow soldiers asked if he could dry it out for me in an effort to revive the phone ./n__label__0 - no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking/n__label__0 its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket ./n__label__0 i purchased the ad2600 after feeling comfortable with the reviews i read here on amazon ./n__label__0 the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight ./n__label__0 it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into ./n__label__0 a 35mm film camera captures the moments you want , while these digital cameras ( my friends now inform me ) all seem to capture the moment immediately following the one you asked to capture ./n__label__0 if it had the same number of  ?  s then it would ask if you want to overwrite another song that just had the same number of  ?  s. . ./n__label__0 maybe i 'll get lucky with the next one ./n__label__0 i love my g2 so thought i would upgrade ./n__label__0 go for it !/n__label__0 very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price ./n__label__0 pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery/n__label__0 + they have great optics ( cp5700 has great optical zoom ) and features , not to mention take great pictures ./n__label__1 the combination of the nokia 6610 and t-mobile service ( signal , price , service ) is a winner , i highly recommend it ./n__label__0 this is ridiculous ./n__label__0 b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens tigt and cause potential damage ./n__label__0 the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. ./n__label__0 but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on ithave a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventualy the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments ./n__label__0 i tried to play the song three times , with no success ./n__label__0 what can i say , i bought the ad600 2 years ago and it was probly the best dvd player ever , quality design , stable , plus it uses a standard ide interface so you can use an old dvd drive from your computer if the player dies ./n__label__0 the store clerk concluded that the blurriness may be caused by shaking the camera slightly when i press the button , which is understandable since this camera is lighter than the other two models ./n__label__0 it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error ./n__label__0 i can imagine that they 'd fill up my ibook 's internal memory pretty quickly ./n__label__0 all i am looking for is a rebate form !/n__label__0 the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class ./n__label__0 the service from t-mobile is very good too ./n__label__0 it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video ./n__label__0 m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; it does n't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12.5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray !/n__label__0 the screen 's large and easily read ./n__label__0 i called them twice and both times they said it is  about to ship  ./n__label__0 it has many great features and very few bad ones ./n__label__0 value : comparing data storage with price ./n__label__0 the product manufacturer promised me 14 hours , and what i recieved was 6-8 ./n__label__0 i used lexar 256 mb and i still use it which means nothing is wrong with lexar ./n__label__0 the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with  canned air ./n__label__0 i also discovered the exposure-bracket setting , which enables you to take three exposures with one press of the shutter : the first at the camera-determined exposure , then one lighter and one darker ./n__label__0 if you do n't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they cannot be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders ./n__label__0 the flap completely covers the screen because there is no window to see it ./n__label__0 quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time ./n__label__0 it would have been much easier to use a windows explorer style navigation system ./n__label__0 it is easy to  focus  in on the drawbacks , so do n't think i hate this camera ./n__label__0 up , down , left , and right would have given me better control ./n__label__0 in the end this is the one that we decided upon and since have never had buyer 's remorse ./n__label__0 it was n't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman ./n__label__0 if i have to get into making playlists to avoid rear-end collisions , i 'll just buy a regular portable cd/mp3 player and burn myself collections of about 120 tracks per disk ./n__label__0 the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera ./n__label__0 in the last month i bought the apex ad-1600 and the ad-1220 ./n__label__0 seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) ./n__label__0 i 'm considering using mine as a distraction to winter boredom in the paintball fields ./n__label__0 the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price ./n__label__0 purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it ./n__label__0 and how can i do that ... ./n__label__0 if you happen to push the wrong button , you can wipe out the order of songs you had put in ./n__label__0 7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook ./n__label__0 the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n't see on a sony and an overall plasticky feel/n__label__0 i do n't think i was asking too much ./n__label__0 and most stores will not take back a product 90 days after purchase ./n__label__0 this was quickly and easily fixed by going to the creative web site and downloaded then installed the updated driver ./n__label__1 point the  media sniffer  to your music files and let it do the rest ./n__label__0 i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n't do it !/n__label__0 guess i will return it for an exchange and hope for the best with the new one ./n__label__1 i do recommend getting the data kit for those geeks ./n__label__0 but that 's a moot point now ./n__label__0 i compared it to the olympus c5050z , the sony dcs-f 717 and the nikon 5700 ./n__label__0 very easy to use ./n__label__0 you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly ./n__label__0 the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof ./n__label__0 the instructions that come with it do n't explain how to make things simple ./n__label__0 the service from the supplier was exceptional ./n__label__0 just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has ./n__label__0 i can 't simply bring up my entire list of songs , click play , and then hit next ./n__label__0 what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software ./n__label__0 i am a long-time user of highly responsive film slrs and professional quality external flash equipment , just so you know my bias ./n__label__0 with apple , you get a good product , but you get it the way apple wants you to have it ./n__label__0 4 an ac adapter for powering the camera while the battery 's out is not included , although one can be purchased separately ./n__label__0 i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched !/n__label__1 if you want great sound quality , do n't want to spend an arm and a leg per-gigabyte , do n't mind being something of an iconoclast among many ipod users , and are willing to sacrifice a few cubic centimeters of your personal space for a large discount , then i would suggest the zen xtra for you ./n__label__0 four megapixels is great ./n__label__0 i originally purchase a 30 gb nomad zen xtra as a portable mp3 player ./n__label__0 navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch ./n__label__0 the warranty is 90 days ./n__label__0 that does n't leave me with a good feeling about its future stability ./n__label__0 2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations ./n__label__1 you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck/n__label__0 it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted ./n__label__0 it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket ./n__label__0 the player itself has all sorts of problems ./n__label__0 over time , i loaded hundreds of cds onto the computer , and the idea of carrying around all of my music with me became attractive ./n__label__0 this did not give me enough control ./n__label__0 i have done some research and experimenting with the remote when my apex ad-2500 seemed to have lost its video signal ./n__label__0 the light auto-correction is awesome ./n__label__0 i am quite happy with the camera ./n__label__0 1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want ./n__label__0 the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect ./n__label__0 i applied a $ 25 amazon gift voucher i got for christmas so i only ended up paying $ 29 for this machine ./n__label__0 when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with ./n__label__0 i 'm sending mine back and am waiting for the problem to be corrected ./n__label__0 i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional ./n__label__0 as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better ./n__label__0 well that was not a simple task ./n__label__0 so i had to give up and return it , having lost about 4 hours ./n__label__0 that way i could keep it in the case all the time ./n__label__0 and as i said in my review of the s330 , all of these digital cameras are easier to use with apple computers ./n__label__0 a great new use for that underutilized computer ./n__label__0 it actually gives the option to clear the previous playlist when i want to play another list ./n__label__1 you can even take a picture of yourself while looking at the lcd ./n__label__0 the remote is a little hard to understand ./n__label__1 read the instuctions - do not plug the zen into your computer until you have installed all the software onto your computer and rebooted it ! !/n__label__0 this seemed like a really good compromise ./n__label__0 amazon is awaesome !/n__label__0 now i have not owned other mp3 players as i was waiting until they matured , but since i received it as a gift i now have this one ./n__label__0 obviously there is no composite video output and different analog audio signals at progressive scan mode ./n__label__0 i have not used the progressive scan feature ./n__label__0 i cannot stress enough how big of a benefit it is to have a european phone and a european company providing your cell phone service ./n__label__0 my last phone was a samsung s105 which imo is superior and cheaper to this phone ./n__label__0 the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good ./n__label__0 it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features ./n__label__0 the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player ./n__label__0 another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying ./n__label__0 once again , the sound is awesome , the batterly life is only 6-8 hours , and that is because all my music is 320 kbps which does affect the battery life ./n__label__0 who cares if it does n't have multiple slots ?/n__label__0 i would have given a 3 to 5 star review in my first few weeks , depending on how mad i felt about the crummy software ./n__label__0 i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it ./n__label__0 the software lets you pop in a cd and then scans the internet to name the artist , track name and album name ./n__label__0 i did everything i could , and it took many days of frustration before concluding that the only way to transfer to pc is with the card reader ./n__label__0 all rechargeable batteries lose their holding power over time ( around 2 years ) ./n__label__0 i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful ./n__label__0 thank you !/n__label__0 so , i bought apex ad-2600 in november ' 03 from amazon ./n__label__1 find another phone , or buy this one in its manufacturer-unlocked form ./n__label__0 i 'm sending this pup back to amazon and looking for the 2500 on ebay ./n__label__0 i recieved the camera , inserted a larger cf card , charged the battery , and handed it to my wife ./n__label__0 and since the current language selection was english (even though i think only the menu supports chinese , and not the track info ) ... all it saw were  ?  s and even though the songs had different names in chinese ../n__label__0 while the ipod 's form factor is much nicer , here 's where the zen is better ./n__label__0 other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system ./n__label__0 they sent me a new ad2600 with the same problem ./n__label__0 this can be done on a song by song basis or in mass ./n__label__0 great price ./n__label__0 zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player ./n__label__0 and maybe the answer is to buy an ipod ./n__label__0 compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use ./n__label__0 because of the large capacity of the nomad , owners can load hundreds of cds on to it ./n__label__0 i called the canon technical service center to see if i had a defective camera ./n__label__0 the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on ./n__label__0 so i do n't know what the previous review that could n't do more than 30 songs is talking about ./n__label__0 the eax sound enhancement feature did n't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq ./n__label__0 and since i 'm out here i can 't mail it back under my 90 days and they wo n't help me out cause they say that the conditions here are not covered under the warranty ./n__label__0 i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email ./n__label__0 choosing zennx is a no-brainer when factoring in the cost of a new $ 400 + ipod every few years versus the $ 50 cost of replacing zennx 's rechargeable battery ./n__label__0 this is almost it but not quite but the price was right ./n__label__0 thumbs down on that one ./n__label__0 the vibration is not top ./n__label__0 i 'm not sure if it would survive a fall from 3 feet ./n__label__0 the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera ./n__label__0 it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device ./n__label__1 do n't be pulled in by the great price -- you get what you pay for , and there 's a reason this model is so cheap ./n__label__0 amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping ./n__label__0 i am going to have so much fun with this camera and when i learn more i will post a more accurate review ./n__label__0 great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price ./n__label__0 the dvd player does not work properly ./n__label__0 i think the ipod versus zen typifies differences between apple and win machines ./n__label__1 for those of you who already bought this camera , i suggest you buy a hi-ti dye-sub photo printer ./n__label__0 it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) ./n__label__0 5 for  digital film  it uses compact flash cards , which are easy to find , cheap , reliable and supported by many other devices you may have at hoome ./n__label__0 the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) ./n__label__0 the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer ./n__label__0 i personally am not crazy about the looks of either the ipod or the nomad ./n__label__1 if you are ok paying $ x00 for something that can be used now , but is likely to both get better and cost less in the future then try to determine which device is the lesser of evils for you ./n__label__0 no comments on reliability , warranty , repairs , accessories ./n__label__0 now let 's talk about the software ./n__label__0 it also has unproven battery life ./n__label__0 they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy ./n__label__0 then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all ./n__label__0 most of our emplyees use this model phone ./n__label__0 best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything ./n__label__0 here 's what you may miss or be annoyed by with this camera :/n__label__0 very sleek & stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has ./n__label__0 there have also been times that the unit has been turned off for some period of time , upon powering it up it starts on the  now playing  screen with a song or cd that i had been playing days before ./n__label__0 of all these phones the motorolla and the sony ericsson phones are the smallest ./n__label__0 i would not give up this phone for the world ./n__label__0 the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing ./n__label__0 i paid $ 49 and now it 's $ 125 !/n__label__0 the headphones are n't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity ./n__label__0 sheesh ! !/n__label__0 i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus ./n__label__0 from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic megatones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone ./n__label__0 sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much ./n__label__0 unit took forever since the begiining to recognize and play discs ./n__label__0 creative also sells batteries via its website , so there 's no shipping off my player and waiting for it to be sent back to me with the new battery ./n__label__0 i could n't be happier with t-mobile either , i switched from cingular ./n__label__0 i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work ./n__label__0 as soon as i lifted the unit out of the box , i questioned my judgement ./n__label__0 the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product ./n__label__0 i bought the zen xtra 30g as a gift ./n__label__0 this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera ./n__label__0 4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera ./n__label__0 unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed ./n__label__0 3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws ./n__label__0 this gap allowed the front panel to fly off after barely being touched ./n__label__0 had to cut out a window using a swiss army knife ./n__label__0 i am bored with the silver look ./n__label__0 so loud , really , that it does n't work terribly well as a silent ringer option ./n__label__0 - no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones ./n__label__0 the ipod is a neat piece of machinery but after screwing around with both of them i think the zen products are the way to go ./n__label__0 after @ 3 months , it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds ./n__label__0 it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes ./n__label__0 grandma in church quiet ./n__label__0 i am not talking milliseconds ./n__label__0 the camera arrived on time and in perfect condition ./n__label__0 you might think you are saving money by buying an apex but in the long run you will spend more ./n__label__0 although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone ./n__label__0 the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen ./n__label__0 the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times ./n__label__0 i bought this player during a christmas sale at an excellent price ./n__label__0 i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed !/n__label__0 overall i like it ./n__label__0 accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive ./n__label__1 i definately recommend a large memory card ./n__label__0 4 . and , of course , i wanted a respected brand and had to stay within my budget because i had bought an expensive camcorder before but had n't used it much ./n__label__0 but there are certain issues might be they are to me here - all of them are minor; not major ones though ,/n__label__0 the sound is great even with the supplied earbuds -- but i find earbuds uncomfortable so i use different headphones ./n__label__0 from a dime store disposable to a top of the line eos , all film cameras share this ability to capture the moment you tell them to ./n__label__0 it works great ./n__label__0 the gprs connection is sometimes slow , and writing instant messages with the included aol instant messenger software is a pain , but the other t-zones applications are quite useful ./n__label__0 i purchased two apex 2600 for christmas presents ./n__label__0 yes , i push the button down halfway first to avoid the autofocus delay ./n__label__0 the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have ./n__label__1 get cheaper panasonics or toshibas or even sonys ./n__label__0 it can get pretty lonely out there ./n
