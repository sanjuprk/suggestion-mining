also kept small amounts of local currency for small purchases .	037	For others that have been to these countries when would you suggest was a good time ?	038	I was thinking perhaps September or March\/April .	039	I like warm weather but after touring this European summer hubby did n't think that much of the high 30s we had or the 44 in Turkey -LRB- due to his asthma -RRB- .	040	He would be much happier with high 20s .	041	I know this question is difficult to answer as every season is so changeable from previous years	042	The weather was beautiful and not too hot .	043	We were able to wear shorts some days and even go for a swim .	044	In Spain it was kind of hot and we tried to put the air on and were told they only run it in July and Aug. .	045	I think it was in the mid 80 there and around 80 in Morocco .	046	Hotels were very comfortable and very nice .	047	We went there the around the 20th of April a few years ago .	048	"I went mid-September -LRB- 2005 -RRB- and the weather was great , not too hot or too cool-think mostly in the mid 20 's and only had rain on 1 day in the afternoon ."	049	"I 'm not a shorts kind of person , spent most of the time in capris , jeans , short sleeved t-shirts ."	050	You 'll get the most heat in Morocco but even that was around the mid to high 20 's .	051	You 'll love it !	052	"Hi , we went on this tour in the middle of April a few years ago , we had good weather the whole time from low 20s to high 20s in Morocco ."	053	There were fields of wildflowers in Morocco which was a real surprise .	054	This was a wonderful tour you will have a great time .	055	I was wondering when Americas school holidays start and finish .	056	Areas of Montana and Wyoming I 'm going to a ranch before my tour .	057	"Last edited by : Allison , 14 January 2008 23:33"	058	That depends on the school district and there are a lot of them .	059	Generally the school vacations start about the first week in June and end about the last week in August .	060	"As Pauline wrote , each individual school district sets their own dates ."	061	The ones I noted are in Northern California .	062	New York schools end the last week of June and return first week of September .	063	I have just been reading the Travel tips for Australians and in particular about `` Secure Sentinel '' for protecting credit\/debit cards etc. and other travel documents whilst away .	064	Has anyone had any experience with this company and is it worth joining for 12 months ?	065	I hate to think what would happen if either myself or my husband had our wallets stolen whilst away .	066	We will be traveling with Insight for 2 weeks in Switzerland but then we have another 5 weeks in Europe .	067	"We consider it cheap insurance in case anything goes wrong , which we hope never does ."	068	We updated everything before we went away last year	069	Make sure you add your passports	170	We think this service is great value	071	We have been members of Secure Sentinel for a few years now .	072	I have had cause only once to use the service when I had my purse stolen from work .	073	Just one phone call	074	It was a great relief not to have to all the ringing around .	075	It was stressful enough as it was !	076	Thanks for the info Midge .	077	We have decided to join hopefully only for `` peace of mind '' but if something does goes wrong we will be able to get prompt action on the canceling of our cards etc. .	078	We really enjoyed our time in Switzerland	079	We are going on the Romantic European trip starting on the 11th May 2008 and need to know if it will be warm enough for 3\/4 pants and t-shirts or will we need warmer stuff .	080	What will the average temperature be .	081	"The weather can be all over the place , I would take both summer and winter and some in between a warm jacket , layers ."	182	"I 've had snow , rain , nice sunny days but cool and then some days in the 30s ."	083	Be prepared for anything .	184	Tempeture mid teens -

you should find 3 or 4 to choose from .	0115	"fendi , it 's sounds like you are traveling independently and not doing an Insight tour ."	0116	Check out http://www.fodors.com/ as they cater for the ` non tour ' traveller .	0117	"I think once you 're in Spain , you ca n't miss spain travel and cadiz ."	0118	They are all unforgettable places to visit and I 'd love to go back for awhile .	0119	"If you 're in Barcelona be sure to check out the Picasso museum as well and I think the best way to get around Spain is by train , and you can see the beautiful scene along the way ."	0120	Have a good trip in Spain !	0121	Sounds like more of that Spain spam we 've had on and off for awhile now .	0122	"Laj , I think you are correct ."	0123	"I was wondering if it would be a better idea to bring all Euros or should I bring some of the local currency and if so , how much ?"	0124	"Also , is it relatively easy to exchange Euro 's for the local currency when I am in Prague , Budapest and Vienna ?"	0125	The currency for Austria is the euro anyway .	0126	While the other 2 have local currency I believe they accept euro as well .	0127	the best bet is to either get a currency pack which will contain the correct currency or use the atm for Prague and Budapest that is what I did and it was not trouble at all .	1128	In fact I did not need any currency in Budapest as I did all the optionals and used credit card .	0129	For Prague I took out about 600 krone but 400 would have been enough .	0130	I bought a quick lunch and still had some money over to buy a few little things .	0131	Thank you Neice	0132	"Jos , when you say currency pack - what exactly do you mean - is this something that you can do with Insight while on tour ."	0133	"Sorry , I am new to this ."	0134	Insight offer you the opportunity to purchase a starter pack of the different currencies you 'll use on your tour .	0135	"We did n't purchase one , but it would have been helpful on our trip ."	0136	We relied mostly on ATMs and just exchanged some of our Euros in Budapest and Prague .	0137	I found we needed to have some local currency for the villages we visited and some of the smaller stores .	0138	It made it easier .	0139	"If you buy in Euros , you 'll mostly get the change in the local currency and it 's a bit confusing ."	0140	So avoiding using Euro if you are close to leaving .	1141	You 'll be left with all the change .	0142	"When departing Poland and the Czech Republic and Hungary , I just exchanged whatever local currency I had left , back into Euro at the border exchange shops ."	0143	Have Insight offered ` currency ' packs since the Euro came into being ?	0144	I did the ` Highlights of Eastern Europe ' back in 2002 and it was n't offered then .	0145	"I took Euro 's with me and exchanged some of them at the borders , for the local currency ."	0146	I found the eaiest way to work out what you need in the local currency is to do some window shopping and having a look on the exchange rate boards that are displayed at banks etc. and then work out from there what you need .	1147	Even a local cafe will display the price of a toasted sandwich etc. .	0148	So by doing that it will give you a pretty good idea .	0149	I have only ever had starter currency packs offered for European tours strarting and finishing in London .	0150	In fact I have not had starter packs offered for quite some time now .	0151	We are planning to do the Britain and Ireland Discovery 22 day tour in August next year and would like some feedback from someone who has done this previously .	0152	Any pros or cons would be appreciated .	0153	We are tossing up between Insight and another company .	0154	Any help would be greatly appreciated .	0155	"It was great , there was a lot to see and discover ."	0156	You do need to be aware that some of the hotels on this tour are not as good as that is all that is available in some of the remote areas .	1157	But the sights are well worth it .	0158	"My favorites would be Orkney and the hotel in Thurso is pub standard but worth it for the day trip , skye is of the same standard but again the area is lovely ."	0159	"I think this tour on the whole is a good one with lots to see , and like any tour some things dont suit everyone ."	0160	I did the tour earlier this year .	0161	"Calli , I found one tour tale for you to read about the tour , under Tour Tales , then `` Where are all the Tales ? ''"	0162	Britain and Ireland Discovery	0163	We are also planning to do this tour in July and was wondering if you could post something about your tour in the Tour Tales posts .	0164	I think on this tour there was enough time to soak up the atmosphere of the places visited and that made it that more special .	0165	"I will try and write a tale , I did not keep a diary on this tour ."	0166	"I was having such a lovely time that writing was just in the way , and so dont have an accurate account of all the places visited , and they were numerous ."	0167	"I have to say that the weather wasnt with us and it rained most of the time , but made no difference it was still lovely ."	0168	Thank you so much for recommending this tour tale .	0169	I thouroughly enjoyed reading about the experiences and it has given me a much better understanding of the tour and what to expect .	0170	Jos I know what you mean about trying to keep a dairy on holiday .	0171	I started but as there is always plenty to do i forgot to keep it up .	0172	Too Busy Sightseeing .	0173	"As a first time bus traveller , has anyone out there done this European Grandeur Tour and can offer any advice or travel trips ."	0174	"e.g. length of tour , hotels , optional extras , tour directors , etc."	0175	The only reason we did the Explorer instead was that 3 weeks on a coach was long enough for us .	0176	Both tours are similar except that the Grandeur goes to Spain .	0177	Two night stops are great as you do get to see something of the town or city you are in .	0178	"All hotels were fine , meals a bit mixed and fellow travellers wonderful ."	0179	Our TD was very organised and that helped a lot in getting us into places before the crowds .	0180	The weather also treated us very well and Mt Pilatus and Eagles Nest were both amazing - we could see for miles .	0181	We did most of the optionals and were pleased that we did .	0182	Some are better than others but being with the group was part of the fun .	0183	As a fellow Kiwi I can really recommend touring with Insight .	0184	Friends of ours did the `` Grandeur '' in 2005 and my husband and myself did the European Explorer in June this year .	0185	So it really comes down to personal choice .	0186	I have written a report on the European Explorer in `` Tour Tales '' and you may find that this will give you an idea of day by day touring .	0187	"Would love to go again , maybe in 2009 ."	0188	We are all booked for the 18th September 2007 so it is all rather exciting now we have made our decision .	0189	So if any of you are doing an extended tour to Jordan make sure you research it before signing up for it .	1190	"Have just returned from Wonders of Egypt tour , absolutely fabulous and great hotels and tour director ."	0191	Ca n't say the same about Jordan .	0192	"Tour guide Tony , not that great , rather rude etc and accom with hotels not good ."	0193	Most of us on the tour were extremely unhappy with Jordan tour but to see the City of Petra amazing .	0194	Sorry to hear the Jordan part of your tour was not up to scratch .	0195	I 've not read a tour tale since Tangatta 's and it was n't all that complementary .	0196	We 've booked the Jordan Experience tour starting 4Apr2008 .	0197	It 's the start of our `` Saved for over 4 years and blowing it all in a month '' holiday .	0198	If you get some time could you either post a Tour Tale or outline some of the problem area 's with the tour .	0199	We wo n't be changing our booking but the more prepared we are the better we can cope with any problems .	0200	"I was thinking of Jordan next year , you do n't think that maybe it was made worse because it came after Egypt and the Tour Directors there are so good ?"	0201	Which TD did you have in Egypt by the way ?	0202	"I think that the tour guide was no interested in stopping to show us interesting things , he continually talked about himself etc , was rude especially to woman and not interested in participating with the crew he had to guide ."	0203	"There were stuff ups with late comers arriving at 10pm and no dinner , the tour guide not bothering to come and sort out anything only by phone with no outcomes , he was extremely distant and difficult to approach , accomodation was not 4-5 star as previously advertised with Insight with most rooms where ever we stayed having faulty air con , taps , sinks etc and this was across the board , not just a few people , breakfast cold , and that is just to name a few things ."	0204	Like I said the Rose City of Petra is really the main thing in Jordan and you will have to hire a private tour guide to do the 45 kms  approx  to the dead sea .	1205	Mustapha was the one in Egypt .	0206	"Hi , I have never done the express check in for any other tour , but thought I will this time ."	0207	Can anyone tell me please before I start the process if they ask for the transfer details to and from the airports please .	0208	"I still have a few details to sort with my TA and do n't wo n't to get part way through this and have to stop , many thanks !"	0209	"I do n't believe that they do ask you about transfers , from what I remember -LRB- did it a month or two ago most recently -RRB- ."	0210	There is a slight possibility I might have forgotten though I do n't think so	0211	Address Line 1 :	0212	Address Line 2

all of your traveling plans are coming along well .	0246	We prebooked for Easy Pace Spain and Portugal and now that the brochures are avail electronically we are being quoted a much higher amount by my travel agent .	0247	We assume that the price quoted in the brochure for tour and air is accurate unless your departure was not from Toronto -LRB- than you had to add on -RRB- but we are quoted $ 500 more per person !	0248	Has anyone else ever been charged more than the quoted price in the brochure including air ?	0249	Any info or feedback is appreciated !	0250	"I have booked air twice through Insight and in both instances paid more than the brochure price to get the airline and routing that I wanted , not taking into account the additional amount I would have to pay anyway to get to Toronto or Montreal ."	0251	"However , I have never paid anywhere near $ 500 over brochure price ."	0252	"I found that the flights at the brochure price are often airlines or routings that I would not choose -- for example , while I do n't mind flying KLM , I do not like that bus ride to Montreal to make the connection ."	0253	"You need to find out exactly what your TA is basing the airfare quote on - and I 'm not sure that the Insight air price includes taxes and surcharges , etc. which these days can easily add $ 300 + to the cost of a flight to Europe ."	1254	 I paid almost $ 400 in taxes and surcharges on a flight to Athens in September . 	0255	"For us on the west coast , it is better for us to book our air directly ."	0256	"We have just been enquiring about our flights to Paris , and the taxes , surcharges , etc. is $ 362 ."	0257	I also booked mine independently from Insight using my travel agent and saved quite a bit .	0258	The flights were identical to what Insights have to offer so connections and arrival airport pickups were no problem .	0259	On a previous trip I used airline points because it was a guaranteed departure date .	0260	"However , I booked my most recent flight with Insight because the departure date was NOT guaranteed and cancellation insurance would have cost about $ 300 more to cover me for non-medical type of cancellations ."	0261	"If you do book your own airfare , be sure you do n't have problems if Insight has to cancel the tour or reschedule it ."	1262	Any chance it could be because the European currency has grown so much stronger ?	0263	I know the Canadian dollar is higher than the US now and some of us had hoped for breaks as a result but the euro keeps going up as well and you 're heading to Europe ?	0264	"In any case , your travel agent can usually do better for you on price and routing ."	0265	"I appreciate the responses ... after much inquiring and frustration , I am happy to say that the price is much closer to the borchure price now ."	0266	"It sounded as though it was part confusion , part inexperience etc but it should turn out in the end ."	0267	Thanks to all those who took the time to respond to my initial angry post !	0268	We are looking at our options for traveling to France in September 2008 .	0269	We have been on 4 Insight tours and have been very happy with all of them .	0270	So it would take a lot to make us consider another company .	0271	"But we really want to see the Bayeux tapestry and Insight does n't include it in Normandy , Brittany and the Loire Valley ."	0272	Is it worth changing to Globus who do a similar tour that does include Bayeux or can anyone suggest a daytrip from Paris that we could add to the Insight Tour ?	0273	I would say Globus is on par with Insight .	0274	We took a trip with them and were happy .	0275	We like Insight a little better though .	0276	More room on the bus .	0277	"Why not travel with Trafalgar , Insight 's sister company ?"	0278	They go to Bayeux and the other places as well .	0279	"We went with them a couple years ago and saw the tapestry , Normandy and Loire Valley and I consider them more on a par with Globus than Insight who I consider a premium company to both ."	0280	We prefer Insight because of the roomier coaches but would certainly travel again with Globus .	0281	"We chose Insight over Globus because of the itinerary , ironically on the Normandy and Loire Valley tour ."	0282	"At that time , Insight went to Bayeux and had preferable Normandy sites my husband wanted to visit ."	0283	"As far as quality , the companies were actually very close in our experience ."	0284	We choose by itinerary .	0285	"Thankyou South , bill and Gertie for your replies ."	0286	We 're tossing up between Globus and Trafalgar .	0287	We 'll probably go with Trafalgar because they have listed guaranteed tours for next September .	0288	We 'll miss the extra space of Insight though - my husband is 6ft 2 and has to sit with his legs out in the aisle on normal buses .	0289	It 's good to know your opinion of Globus .	0290	The Bulletin boards operated by Insight and Trafalgar give me extra confidence in both of them because I can read about other peoples ' experiences - good and bad .	0291	Stay with Insight and when in Angers see the Apocalypse tapestry in the Angers castle ... it is 103 metres long and you will not be disappointed .	1292	Research this and I 'm sure you 'll find it satisfactory .	1293	The entry cost to the castle was 7.50 euro in June this year .	0294	I thought it quite outstanding .	0295	"Can anyone please share their experiences \/ suggestions for a Winter tour in Europe -LRB- UK , France , Italy -RRB- ."	0296	Any clothing and packing suggestions ?	0297	"In a nutshell , the weather in Europe in winter will be similar to what you are used to in New Jersey ."	0298	"In December , the sun wo n't be up until 9 or 10 in the morning , and it will be dark by 4 in the afternoon ."	0299	"The Christmas markets are a lot of fun , if you are there in December ."	0300	"After the Christmas season , there are n't as many tourists , so the

meal and a greeting ?	0640	"The tip is usually paid at the end of the tour , usually the last evening , or this has been the case on the tours I have done ."	0641	It is really up to you how much you give and when you decide to give it .	0642	I think the suggested amounts are fair .	0643	"The tours I have done , the tour director and the driver have gone above and beyond the call of duty ."	0644	Go to FIND and type in `` tipping .

question about the first and last day , I take those into consideration ."	0654	As mentioned this topic is well documented .	0655	I am trying to prepare myself for sending mail back home during our Eurpoean Heritage trip .	0656	Can someone advise me on postage to Aussie e.g. Does each European country have their own stamps and postage rates and not a common postage like the Euro currency ; are postage stamps readily available in Insight hotels ; is there a `` standard '' postcard size that will fit in a common envelope that I could have preaddressed etc. .	0657	Each country has their own postage system and cost for postage varies .	0658	"In my experience the rate for postcards is specific to postcards , and does n't allow for an envelope ."	0659	"You could try risking it , but no guarantees that it will arrive at the other end ."	1660	Maybe you could use stickers that you have pre-addressed and stick onto the postcard .	1661	You could even print them up on a computer - no excuses for the mail people not reading your handwriting then !	1662	"As far as hotels having stamps - most will , but no guarantees in some of the countries you 're going to ."	0663	I 'm sure the tour director would be able to help you with that though - and you can always post things from the next stop .	0664	Might be quicker sometimes - not all countries have the same time waits on postage .	0665	Aust post you will come to see is really quite good compared to some !	0666	Just getting back to cost - we usually find that the stamps cost us more than the postcards !	0667	And sizes of cards can vary from one place to another - just like they do vary here in OZ depending on who produces them or who the photographer is .	0668	"Hi MaurJoy , would n't it be nice if there was an easy way to buy lots of stamps at once to mail through the tour - but sadly no. ."	0669	"I usually print off a couple of label sheets , with the addresses of the family"	0670	A bit of a time saver and I

disappointed in 2004 during back to back tours of Greece and UK ."	0757	"Most of the hotels were very ordinary , definitely not 4 star and not in the center of each city as promised , to one being a total disaster ."	0758	look forward to any feedback .	0759	you 're unlikely to get much in the way of feedback on this tour for quite a while because the European Rhapsody including Danube cruise is

answer ."	0772	"I will wait patiently as you asked , and thankyou in advance ."	0773	Do bear in mind that it will always be a `` guess '' what optionals will be offered on your specific tour

guessing until we get there ."	0779	"We did the same tour May last year so thanks anyway Pauline , but I still have my copy from that ."	0780	The dilema is that we were advised that all the optionals on this tour were changing some way with some extras added and some changed or even removed and therefore we thought we had it all under control until that little bit of imformation came our way .	0781	I suppose it is all part of the traveling excitement .	0782	I thought I had read somewhere that you had done this tour before .	0783	"Re my tour , there were about 3 optionals listed on the website and on the printed documents that I received but when I started the tour , the TD had about another 5 or 6 optionals on offer ."	0784	I 'm doing CR of France in September and am looking forward to going back to the south of France .	0785	Our web designers found a glitch in the system which was preventing the Optionals showing on the Easy Pace France tour .	0786	This has now been fixed and the Optionals are now on the web .	0787	Thank you for bringing this to our attention .	0788	Thankyou so much John .	0789	I have just printed them out and perusing them now .	0790	Great

them would be great	0793	Splendours is a great trip and from what I gather it is normally quite a big group  we had 36 .	0794	Travelling back to the airport we had a lady on the bus that had done Jewels and they had 8 in their group but she absolutely loved it .	0795	"I do n't think you can lose no matter which trip you choose , as Egypt is a great country and Insight run by Spring Tours in Egypt is a great company to travel with ."	0796	The TD are amazing and the Egyptian people in general are just wonderful .	0797	I have n't done the Jewels of the Nile as it is a new tour but I have just returned from the Grand Tour which has a few days before hand traveling before meeting up with the Splendours Group .	0798	"Hope this helps , but if you want to know anything else I 'll do my best to help out !"	0799	I 'm also comparing the two tours .	0800	I wonder how active -LRB- and scenic -RRB- the 3 days on Lake Nasser is ?	0801	I 'm afraid it might resemble Canyonlands in Utah

give you a good run down of what to do in Vienna .	0814	Vienna has so much packed into a little space that you will have a difficult choice of what to catch .	0815	Every thing was great and almost all within walking distance of each other .	0816	We spent the extra time at the end of the tour .	0817	there are many things you can do in Vienna on your own .	0818	Maybe go for a walk around the Ring Road where most of Vienna 's Landmarks are .	1819	or Walk in the Kartnerstrass and explore the lovely shops and visit the the St Stephansdom Cathedral .	1820	Why not have a look at the Michaeltor which is behind the side of the Hofburg .	1821	Other great things see Parliament house and the Town hall and the Burgtheather which is opposite .	1822	or Stroll through the many beautiful parks and gardens where alot of famous statues of musicans are expecially in the Stadpark where the Johan Strauss Statue is .	1823	Or you might like to visit the Karlskirche which is not far from the Opera House .	1824	there are so many things to do in Vienna and it is a small city so it is easy to walk to everything .	0825	Cheers Tennis ace .	0826	"we are new to this Forum , and to Insight

are traveling to ?	0836	We are going on the Northern Capital and Russia tour commencing 6the May	0837	Weather last year was cold and rainy .	0838	Wore long sleeves everyday plus rain jacket

thing in Russia was Vodka .	0845	We really enjoyed this trip .	0846	We thought the meal optionals were expensive for what you got compared to other trips we have taken .	0847	"I have recently had hip and knee surgery , beginning to wonder about access to bus ."	0848	How steep are the steps ?	0849	"Yikes , Well , there are two sets of stairs on the bus ... front and back ."	0850	The front are a lot easier -LRB- less steep and much easier to climb  than the back .	0851	"However , your TD will ask people seated in the back to use the back steps and those in front of the back steps to use the front steps ."	0852	This allows the bus to load and unload a lot easier .	0853	Each day your seat assignment will rotate .	0854	"My advice , check out the back steps when you get picked up at the airport ."	1855	At the welcome drink perhaps you could request with your TD to be seated in the front section so you can you the easier steps .	1856	"I do n't know which tour you are contemplating , but on some European tours the steps on the coach would be the least of your worries ."	0857	"I do n't wish to be discouraging , but I think that you need to pick your tour carefully ."	1858	It turned out the seat at the back was the best for him because it was actually the most spacious .	0859	If you 've recently had surgery you 're probably going to want to stretch that side out more often than the 2 hours between rest stops .	1860	Some of the newer buses are `` kneeling '' coaches and the driver can actually lower the front of the bus to make getting on and off more easy .	0861	Be sure to make your Tour Director aware of your situation .	1862	"As Tangata says , depending on the tour you 've booked , coach access may be the least of your problems ."	0863	"For example , some of the smaller towns in Italy can not be reached by coach and we walk up the small and winding roads to the town ."	0864	I was on tour once where one of the passengers had an

the Lake Michigan coastline .	01023	You can follow M-22 north along the coast and it brings you back down into Traverse City .	11024	This is a very popular route for color tours in Michigan .	01025	Part of M-22 runs through Sleeping Bear Dunes which was voted as `` America 's Most Beautiful Place '' on Good Morning America ... this is a very cool and scenic area .	01026	Traverse City is also a very beautiful town and a great place to spend the night after a day of driving .	01027	From there you can continue on US-31 which takes you around the east bay of Grand Traverse bay and north past Torch Lake which was also voted one of the most beautiful lakes in the US.	01028	Keep heading north on 31 and you will go through Charlevoix and Petoskey very nice cities to stop for lunch and go for a walk .	11029	After you go through Petoskey look for M-119 .	11030	"M-119 is about 20 miles long and has been nicknamed `` the tunnel of trees '' , this road is a spectacular drive any time of year but is at it 's best in the fall months for the color tours ."	01031	I 'm from Michigan and we do the color tour thing every year .	01032	Hope this helps !	01033	Vermont has the most intense colors .	01034	A drive up Rt .100 is a great way to see them at their best .	01035	"Thank you , all ."	01036	I put my vote in for New Hampshire .	01037	"The South , Georgia and Tennessee

idea how you can concentrate on your job -- I 'd be jumping out of my skin with excitement .	03080	"Have a wonderful time -- try and stay atuned to the e-coli situation -- has not hit Italy but stay

stay over at hotel near JFK , and fly out of JFK the next morning , back to Miami , or taxi to a hotel near Laguardia , and fly out of Laguardia in the morning ?"	03084	My New York friends tell me it 's easier to deal with Laguardia .	03085	"If you can fly out of JFK , why would you bother with trekking over to LGA ?"	13086	"JFK is n't that bad , and you 'll have to deal with immigration and customs there anyway ."	13087	Not to mention the added cost of a taxi .	03088	"If you 're already arriving at JFK , I do n't think it makes any sense to go to Laguardia ."	13089	"But again if you 're already at JFK , yes I would simply overnight at\/near the airport and continue on to Miami in the morning ."	13090	Perhaps your NY friends mean generally-speaking that Laguardia is a smaller easier airport to deal with ?	03091	What your friends likely mean is that LGA is closer to Midtown and easier to reach from most of New York .	13092	"Once already at JFK , there is little reason to make the cross-island trek to fly out of LGA ."	13093	In that case go there if it 's easier to get to their place .	13094	Are you staying with friends who live close to LGA ?	03095	Here are some potential pitfalls of -LRB- family -RRB- travel - based on our experiences - and how best to deal with them .	03096	While I disagreed with the general tenor of this post : http://www.fodors.com/community/travel-tips-trip-ideas/posting-links-to-blogs.cfm - I am getting rather tired of seeing posts from you that are just links .	03097	It 's becoming clear that you 're

directly to you than here , but I ca n't find any way of doing it ."	03101	I 'm truly sorry you are offended by my postings .	03102	"Yes , I do link to my blog ."	03103	"I used to just blog in a variety of places , like Travelblog ; however the time and tedium of posting photos caused me to try consolidate it all into one place only ."	03104	I can not believe I 'm the only person who has found this to be so .	03105	"Of course I could just cut and paste reports , but personally when I 'm reading about a place I 'm interested in , I 'm generally attracted to the photos more than anything else , as it tends to pique my curiosity about the place ."	03106	"Before we travel anywhere , I spend a lot of time reading trip reports , not only to get excited about the destination , but for tips and advice ."	03107	I would hope the same is true of my postings .	03108	"Although I now see the ` linking ' system is controversial , I did n't realize this until the discussion started a few days ago ."	03109	"I enjoy blogging and writing about our family 's travels and being part of a travel community ; I know from feedback that some people - only a few to be sure - like reading about our travels , as I do about other family 's ."	03110	ok im headed to Ft Lauderdale this summer and my hotel is in Miami whats the best source of transportation to get to miami ... is it

cruise and the hotel that we are stayig in has a shuttle to the port of miami so really no need for a rental	03117	the hotel is in miami	03118	"If so , check out Go Shuttle -LRB- similar to Supershuttle , which currently does n't serve FLL -RRB- ."	13119	"You can catch one as you exit the airport terminal , without a reservation ."	13120	Are you flying into FLL ?	03121	I live in Miami and have used them on occasion .	03122	Check into super shuttle .	13123	They offer service from Fort Lauderdale to Miami .	13124	It 's less than an hour drive .	13125	There are other shared van services .	13126	But also work out the logistics for getting back .	13127	Most do and will sell them even if you do n't book airfare through them .	13128	HAL will offer transfers for free even if

the tour we will be on a couple of Greek islands , so similar info for there would also be great ."	03805	"Our accommodations ferries , flights and transfers have already been paid for ."	03806	The euro looks good against the aussie dollar at the moment so I am thinking of buying some .	03807	I 'll need to do some homework on where the turkish lira stands .	03808	"Christabel , I usually budget for about cash 50 of whatever the local currency is per day and that has worked for me , apart from Switzerland , where it was very expensive ."	13809	This website might give you some idea of the cost of living in Turkey :	13810	I do know that some traders in Turkey will accept USD	13811	If you want to compare the TRY to some other currencies check out http://www.oanda.com/	13812	"I 'm not a big souvenir buyer , usually only buying post cards , fridge magnets and pencils"	03813	Hopefully someone who has visited recently will be able to give you some more recent info .	03814	Turkey is a beautiful country and you should have a great time there .	03815	I did when I visited there years ago .	03816	"Thanks Pauline , I have just looked at numbeo , that is really helpful ."	03817	Our plan is to use ATM machines to get euros and avoid credit charges .	03818	Our bank credits back all ATM charges from other banks .	03819	Are ATM machines readily available on tours like Italian Escapades which goes to all the main tourist sites ?	03820	Another part of our plan is to use wifi calling if possible .	03821	Is free wifi readily available in most tourist locations ?	03822	ATMS are as available in Europe as they are in NA or Australia .	13823	You wo n't have a problem finding or using them .	13824	They will always give you the option to do in English .	13825	And I 've yet to come across a hotel in Europe that did n't have wi-fi .	13826	Charges will vary from free to as bad as $ 16 for 30 minutes .	13827	The average of the non-free hotels was about $ 5 an hour \/ $ 10 for a day .	13828	"Overall , very reasonable and much better than running around trying to find a hotspot near the hotel ."	13829	Yes and Yes .	03830	Last year in Italy though we found it to be the most unreliable country in Europe for telecommunications .	13831	Sometimes it worked and other times it just was dead as .	13832	"The cost is so variable , and can be the dearest in the whole world that we experienced ."	13833	"Yes all the hotels on the Italian Escapades except one have free WIFI , but I still say it will be iffi if it works each time ."	13834	Its not that important to the Italians .	13835	"As to the ATMS they are everywhere and on each occassion as we were driving towards the next city our Tour Director would announce where the most reliable ATMswere in the city and if we needed any help she would come with you , On two occassions she went with us to the ATM and stood by each one of us as we withdrew our money as security and was there to anwer any questions or help in any way ."	13836	"It was always a priority with our TD to do this and also that was the time to ask her directions to anywhere else we needed to go EG chemist , or photography supplies or specialty shops ."	13837	"She knew where everything was , we just had to ask ."	13838	"Again Italy did have some ATMs that decided It would not take EG visa at the moment , so We then used our Mastercard and sometimes it was vica versa , but the TD always had three options of ATMs up her sleeve just in case asthis must happen quite often at busy times such as the middle of the tourist season ."	13839	Go on your tour not worrying about any of this as the insight TDs do all that and know everything .	13840	You are in the best of hands thats why we keep going back with insight .	13841	You feel completly secure .	13842	Also yes and yes .	03843	Its looking like I am about to get a new position with my company which will involve travel to various company sites in the U.S.	03844	"I currently do n't travel for my company and so , am not terribly familiar with our travel policies or how flexible they are for planning ."	03845	I do know there is a little flexibility with hotel selection .	03846	What I 'd like to know from the road warriors out there is :	03847	Is there an airline with a consensus ` best ' frequent flyer ' program ?	03848	What are some key things to look for in those plans ?	03849	Same questions for hotels too - is there a ` best ' frequent stay program and what do you look for ?	03850	One specific thing - my wife and I generally prefer to take the ` big ' vacations abroad - especially Europe - so I 'm thinking it would be good to find an airline\/hotel with benefits which extend to the continent .	03851	Any thoughts or suggestions ?	03852	"As far as FF programs , it depends on your home airport and who the carriers are with the most flights ."	13853	"Many airline FF programs are part of an alliance , so that you can use your miles on partner airlines ."	13854	"My home airline -LRB- meaning they have the most non-stop flights out of my airport -RRB- , USAir , is part of the Star Alliance , so I can earn and use miles on their partners , including United , Lufthansa and SwissAir among others ."	13855	Delta is a part of the Skyteam Alliance which has a whole other set of partners .	13856	And American is part of the One World Alliance with yet another set of partners .	13857	"As for hotel programs , I belong to most of them , but tend towards the Hilton brands and the Starwood brands ."	13858	"I sort of like the Starwood program a bit more , because they allow you to use points plus a little cash for redemption stays ."	13859	"But for business travel , I prefer the Hilton brands ."	13860	All of the programs I 've mentioned have international partners or presence so would work for your European vacations .	13861	I have been a frequent business traveler for many years so I 'll throw my 2 cents in .	03862	"Thanks , Cristina !"	03863	"USAir is probably my ` home ' airline as well , since I live in Phoenix and , now that I see your mention of Starwood that reminds me I 've seen that brand mentioned on these boards before ."	03864	"For business travel , check out the Flyer Talk boards ."	13865	Those people know their stuff .	13866	"They are amazing with info about getting the most out of FF programs , mileage runs , one bagging , etc."	13867	Thanks for the tip MLT !	03868	I 'll check that board out .	03869	M ` lady and I did 9 days in London	03870	Always more to learn tnough !	03871	Just a quick question and that is how much to allow including optionals per day in England\/Scotland and Wales .	03872	This is my first time ever in that part of the world by the way and given that Insight include a lot of things .	03873	I am just thinking in terms of sightseeing and maybe a small souvenir or two from the places visited .	03874	Always lunch -- maybe 6-11 pounds per person if you do n't eat a big meal ; then whatever you choose to spend on souvenirs and that can be trinkets to a piece of tartan wool at the Edinburgh Woolen Mill OR Waterford Crystal .	13875	"Load your debit card OR raise your credit balance and think twice , then buy once !"	13876	"Oh , boy , very hard to help you here ."	03877	"ASSUMING you do NOT mean the optionals offered by the tour guide - such as dinners and special events - which could go to 200 pounds -- ASSUMING that you just mean everyday expenses , that 's still hard !"	03878	Hard to tell .	03879	I am planning to buy the optional tours and something from the places visited so estimating around the 80 to 90 pounds a day mark but nothing over .	03880	I do n't drink any form of alcohol by the way so that keeps the cost down and I am there to see the sights learn the history of the place and have a good time .	03881	Insight includes the meals too in most cases	03882	"I 'd say you will end up `` under budget '' -- truly do n't know but I doubt that , even with ALL the optionals , you will average 80 pounds a day ."	13883	Not drinking will help you -LRB- helped me ! -RRB-	13884	we are doing the britain and ireland discovery tour and were told by the travel agent if we do n't drink and are n't big spenders then 90 pounds each per day should be sufficient	03885	Even if you do n't drink make sure you eat some meals in a pub - not only is it an experience you wo n't want to miss - you will find the cost much more reasonable than a restaurant .	13886	Enjoy your trip Marion	03887	"If you will be at the Thistle Marble Arch , ask the concierge to direct you `` across the street '' to The Three Tuns -- for LUNCH ."	13888	I agree about pub food !	03889	They have been known -LRB- I can attest ! -RRB-	03890	to run out of food before dinner !	03891	Does any body use theh Travelex card and if so how widely is it accepted ?	03892	", has anybody found places where they could n't use it ?"	03893	"Poider , if you mean the Travelex Cash Passport card then yes , I have been using it for a number of years and have always found plenty of ATM 's to use it in ."	13894	"You just use it to withdraw money as it 's a debit card and as it is Pin No driven , no personal details are on it ."	13895	"Besides the Travelex card , I also take my Visa Credit Card ."	13896	"Poider , we have used the Travelex Cash Passport in quite a few countries with no problems ."	13897	It has no international transaction fees .	13898	"New to this - I am posting my first reply , hope this works !"	03899	This year we obtained a 28 degrees credit card -LRB- financed by GE Finance -RRB- and applied online .	03900	Have n't tried it yet - but have heard good comments about it .	03901	"Thanks Rosie , I will have to check that out"	03902	What part of S.A are you from we are south of Adelaide	03903	We are in the southern suburbs of Adelaide too - best area in the best State ... are n't we lucky !	03904	"Yes , the best , where are you headed for your holiday we are going on the Britain and Ireland Discovery tour"	03905	"Getting back to the Travelex Cash Passport\/28 degrees Mastercard - we hate paying all the fees with money transfers etc when overseas - we will avoid that with the Mastercard , but you get the exchange rate on the day ."	13906	"With the Travelex C\/P card , you lock in the exchange rate when the money is loaded on to the card - so both have advantages or possibly disadvantages ."	13907	"We are going on the European Explorer , departing May 29 - not long now and getting VERY excited ."	03908	"Your trip is a few months later , is n't it ?"	03909	"I just wish more people used this forum , so could communicate with our future traveling companions ."	03910	Good luck deciding what to use .	03911	I used the cash passport card when I went to Europe it was very good and all so the 28 degrees card which has no international or annual fees it was under a different name then it was called a Wizzard card .	13912	Found booking my accommodation on line was costing so much with a normal card with all the extra fees ext. Hope you have a great trip Regards Caza	13913	Have just got my new 28 degrees card for my trip to England in September .	03914	I was using the travelex card in Europe back in 2007 but do not be looking out for the travelex signs around the place .	13915	These signs are rare but most of the atms over there accept that and most cards that have the cirrus symbol on the back are just like our atms here you can withdraw from your savings in the currency of that country .	13916	For my Canadian trip I am taking a travel card from the commonwealth bank loaded up with canadian dollars and a mastercard debit card and my usual keycard that I use here in Sydney .	13917	As a last resort I am also taking my visa but will try not to use it because of the high charges .	13918	Poider - I am not doing a European tour with insight but I am doing the trans Canada Odyssey departing May 9 from Vancouver .	03919	I hope this helps and I hope you enjoy your trip - regards Tezza .	03920	Hi can some kind person please assist .	03921	Will my dome shaped cabin bag be small enough to fit on the Coach .	03922	Base 6.5 '' x 17.5 '' x 14.5 '' tall	03923	Base 16.5 cm x 45cm x 37cm tall	03924	These are close measurements but not exact .	03925	The bag is able to be squashed in here	03926	"Last edited by : Susannah , 24 February 2011 09:53"	03927	Insight used to provide branded carry-on bags that were approx .	13928	41cm x 28cm x 15cm or 16.5 '' x 11 '' x 6 '' which is not dramatically different to your bag .	13929	"The overhead shelf is quite small and is really only suitable for jackets , rainwear , etc. , so carry-on bags have to go somewhere at your feet ."	13930	There is plenty of room for that .	03931	"Many of our guests elect to only take a purse , pocketbook or small camera bag onto the coach , while stowing the `` main '' carry-on underneath ."	13932	"Most of the times , since we never allow more than 40 guests on our coaches , there is plenty of space for your carry-on in the compartment of luggage hold next to the front door ; your tour director will assist you in stowing your bag as you board , and you retrieve it when you exit the coach ."	13933	"This makes entry and egress easy and comfortable , and you do n't have to worry about space issues ."	13934	Hope to welcome you on one of our tours in the near future !	03935	Read more about Bernhard	03936	"As you read this message , SCROLL to the top of this page and see the word FIND ."	03937	Click it and fill in the blank space that will appear with the words `` carryon bags .

.	03973	Also lots and lots of walking .	13974	We done all the optionals around 2000 euros for the two of us .	13975	If you go to Discovery tours on the corner of your web page and bring up your tour it will have a part for optionals .	13976	Your tour director gives you a sheet with what you have to pick from .	13977	Our tour director was Richard if you get him you will be lucky .	13978	We done this tour last Sept. very busy early mornings and late nights .	03979	I originally printed off the optionals from there website and my mum and i went through them and crossed most of them off and were only going to to 1 or 2 .	13980	Then once we were on the tour and heard a little more about what each were we decided to do a few more which ended up being almost all the optionals .	13981	Dont make any firm plans on what you will and wont do just yet	13982	I havnt done a tour of Europe but i did do one of canada and america .	03983	"G ` day , doing the Brittain and Ireland Discovery in August and just wondering ,"	03984	"all things being average , what time do we generaly rock up at the gotels each night ?"	03985	"I will say that I ca n't remember ever being later than 6:00 p.m. , but sometimes earlier than 4:30 p.m if the TD wants to do a walk-around before dinner ."	13986	I suspect you will get a whole variety of answers .	13987	i 've done two Brit\/Ireland\/Scotland INSIGHT tours and there is no simple answer .	03988	We done this tour in 2009 most days we got to hotels about 4.30 .	13989	The only time we were late was when we arrived in Thurso as we went to the Queen Mothers Castle of May first .	13990	So it was closer to 6 oclock .	13991	In Europe we were lucky to get to our hotel some days by 10pm .	13992	"Hi Again , I am stayingat the Thistle Marble Arch and am wondering if anybody can give me a rough estimate on how long it will take to get off plane clear customs and get transfered to the Motel ?"	03993	"It was a Saturday morning , so no traffic , which meant we were at the hotel before 9:30 am -LRB- including 3 stops to drop off others -RRB- ."	13994	"The notes from last year 's trip was n't as detailed , but it looks like we landed at 7am , there was n't a huge line in customs so were out probably within 1\/2 hr ."	13995	"The wait for the transfer was approx 1 hr and then to the hotel , we were dropped off first ."	13996	"It was a Saturday so again no traffic , maybe 1\/2 hr ride , and luckily our room was available ."	13997	"I think the timing all depends on if you 're landing at a popular time , how many people are waiting for the transfer at the same time , and if you arrive on a weekday or weekend in regards to traffic ."	13998	"I took a look my notes from Aug2009 , we landed at approx 6:30 am through customs and then by 8:30 we were on the transfer bus to the hotel ."	03999	Both were from Terminal 3 .	04000	"thanks rita we are arriving at 5.55 am on a Thursday morning , so maybe a fair bit of traffic but hopefully at that time of the morning there wo n't be too many people at customs"	04001	"Peter , I have n't checked what is currently on offer but from memory , the included Insight Transfers start at about 0930 ."	14002	I 'm sure others will correct me if I 'm wrong .	04003	"We were last to get our luggage , so from there at 9:30 a.m. and then going through customs and getting the transfer , we arrived at Thistle Marble Arch at 11:00 a.m."	14004	Also it was midweek so heavier traffic .	14005	"I believe that the the transfer company used then , Dot to Dot is no longer in business so probably now they have more efficient transfers ."	14006	We probably waited a good 1\/2 hour before our transfer ride arrived .	14007	I checked my notes from our Spotlight trip in 2008 .	04008	"So , all in all it is one of variable scenarios that again ca n't really be planned too much ."	04009	"Yes , last year there was a different transfer company than dot to dot , but the wait is just as long ."	04010	Anyone know what type of visa my hubby will need when traveling through Russia ?	04011	I am getting nowhere with the Embassy !	04012	He is starting in uk and traveling by motorbike around the Baltic sea clockwise eventually traveling through Russia .	04013	"He will be in and out within a day , will not be staying over night there ."	04014	The tourist visa site I have looked at says he has to have a booked accommodation ticket -LRB- which he does not have as he is not staying in russia -RRB- and the transit visa says he has to have a valid plane ticket ... so i 'm guessing its not that !	04015	"Last edited by : John - Moderator , 18 January 2011 13:33"	04016	"As your husband is n't doing an Insight tour , do n't be

to avoid them .	14064	The technique was amazing of pickpocketers .	04065	Thanks for sharing this here with us .	04066	Has anyone toured the catacombs while in Rome ?	04067	We arrive in Rome in the morning on the day before the tour actually starts and I 'd like to plan something for that day .	04068	"I 'm wondering if I should book this in advance , or if I can wait until that day ."	04069	We 're doing The Best of Italy tour on Oct. 15 .	04070	"I have been to the catacombs and it an excellent experience , not if you a frightened of small spaces though ."	14071	Even if you are there are many more open spots where you can see what is down there .	14072	"This is normally an optional on most tours , but we all know that that can change ."	14073	"If you can do it as part of an optional tour that is best , you will get good comentary and they may even show you the old Appian Way the remains of which is close by , not a mind blowing experience but it is one of those `` I 've been there '' moments particularly for history buffs ."	14074	It 's a little bit out of town so will be a full AM or PM commitment .	14075	Worth it but not at the expence of the Forum and many other of Rome 's jewels in my opinion .	14076	You probably should wait and ask your TD in Rome .	14077	"There are about 40 different catacombs in Rome , all outside the city walls , I hear ."	14078	The popular catacomb is `` Capuchin Catacomb of Bones '' with about 4000 bodies buried there .	14079	quote : Originally posted by Marge V :	04080	New to Insight Tours .	04081	How do you find your transportation to the hotel in Istanbul ?	04082	Are all guests met at the airport with a sign with their name on it ?	04083	Is there a recommended location to meet at after clearing customs ?	04084	Do we collect our baggage first ?	04085	The Airport process is immigration \/ baggage reclaim \/ customs \/ buy an Entry Visa from a machine and then into the Arrivals Hall .	14086	\* Comprehensive transfer details will be advised with your joining instructions 'n' weeks prior to departure .	14087	\* Sometimes pick-up times are at set intervals rather than at a time to coincide exactly with your own arrival .	14088	"Do n't worry about it , there is however one potential exception ... ."	14089	"If you opt to book additional days pre Tour in Istanbul , and I would recommend that you do , then the Airport -RRB- Hotel transfer may not be included but it could be arranged if required ."	14090	In our own experience ... ...	04091	You will notice a group of people standing there with namecards of people they are looking for to pick up .	14092	As we walked by we saw a man standing there with a Insight placecard .	14093	We were meet in the Istanbul Airport arrival hall after exiting customs .	04094	Of course we were looking for him .	04095	This is the same procedure we have experienced on other tours with Insight in the past .	04096	"Does anyone know how strict the company is regarding carry-on , have got small case that is fine on airline as carry-on , need to know if this can go on the coach , thanks"	04097	The overhead racks are very shallow and can not hold anything too substantial .	14098	They are n't like the overhead racks on an airplane .	14099	Backpacks often fit up there when not filled completely because they can be `` squished '' in .	14100	If there 's room for your feet and your bag it should n't be a problem .	14101	-LRB- Rollerboards will not fit . -RRB-	14102	You can do a search on this website to read other comments about carry-on bags .	04103	"When we were on our last trip , we would put our carry on in with the luggage under the bus ."	14104	We brought it out ourselves and the bus driver would store it for us once everybodys suitcase were loaded .	14105	"When we arrived at destination , he would open the luggage door and we would takeout our carry-ons ."	14106	The porters apparently will only handle 1 suitcase per person so we took care of our own carry ons .	14107	"It works good to bring the smaller ones down to the bus in the morning and have it put underneath , but if there is a full bus there may not be enough room and you would have to put in under your feet or seat if i would fit ."	14108	Anyone traveling to London via Heathrow before Sept 5 may want to consider using the Heathrow Connect or Heathrow Express .	14109	The Heathrow connect is offering 50 % off one way or return tickets used before Sept 5 -LRB- promotion code HEC50 -RRB- .	14110	Heathrow Express has a deal for two or more for a roundtrip -LRB- return -RRB- ticket only .	14111	Both have to be purchased in advance on the internet .	14112	Links for the discounts can be found on their home pages .	14113	"Both services run between Heathrow and Paddington Train station , which is near Hyde Park ."	14114	"A short taxi ride to anywhere in London , especially the Marble Arch Area ."	14115	I believe the Heathrow Connect was just a little over 7 pounds for two people one way .	14116	"Last edited by : Lummy , 13 August 2010 02:43"	04117	Thanks for the tip !	04118	It came in handy

recline at all , is it possible to sleep sitting in a plane ?"	04122	we are not going yet for at least 2 years but I am already having trouble sleeping .	04123	Normal economy seats do recline but there is usually very little space .	14124	I am short and even then the lack of space was a problem on some aircraft .	14125	I have been traveling premium economy for the past few years and have found the extra leg room well worth the cost .	14126	Premium economy - no hesitation !	04127	It is definitely worth the cost payng for premium economy but just to let u know not all airlines have it .	14128	I know Qantas and BA have it .	14129	"Premium definatly , but if you have the time check out Business class , by booking and paying 9 months ahead , we got a fare that was only $ 300 more than premium ."	14130	So keep an eye out on the net	14131	Are dressy cloths needed for Back roads of France tour as well as casual ?	04132	Rep we spoke to said casual and business casual only .	04133	We think some of the place we will visit require dressy cloths like dresses and jacket\/tie .	04134	Are we wrong ?	04135	Could someone who has taken this tour give us some insite	04136	"We had a some very nice optional meals , but we did not have to dress up for them ."	14137	I did wear a skirt a few times because it was hot and a nicer top .	14138	"My husband wore cotton pants and a shirt , no jacket or tie ."	14139	Do you mean the Country Roads of France tour .	04140	We took that tour 2 years ago .	04141	"We did not go to the optional show and dinner in Paris , I think it was the Nouvelle Eve , that they went to ."	04142	Maybe someone else can answer about what type of clothing is needed there .	04143	"If you wish to wear a jacket for your evening meals or on an optional then that is just fine but you will likely be the only person wearing one , have yet to see anybody wearing a tie on any tour we have taken with Insight ."	14144	It also takes up too much space in the luggage so do n't bother or worry about it is my advice .	14145	Smart Caj is as good as it gets in France and especially so on a Coach Tour ... including the Moulin Rouge but not the Casino in Monte Carlo I would add .	14146	Hi and welcome CJ	04147	"G ` day , I am doing the 22 day Britain and Ireland discovery tour , and would like to know how long each of the ferry crossings are

?"	04150	I did it back in August 2000 and had a fabulous time .	04151	The visit to the Orkney Islands was the main reason that I did this tour .	04152	My FIL was born and lived on Westray for many years before immigrating to Adelaide .	04153	"Sorry , ca n't remember the ferry crossing times ."	04154	"As it 's all part of the tour , why worry ."	04155	"I am not worried , we are doing the tour in about 2 years and we like to check it all out , we plan a long way ahead , as we do n't have a lot of money we need to get a good idea of just what we need to save , the last thing I want is to get on the tour and find out that I am well short , if i have to save for another 6 months , that would be better than being under prepared ."	04156	Besides we are already losing sleep with excitement it helps hearing others that have been	04157	"The Orkney Islands is about an hour , the other crossings were about the same ."	14158	Very early starts to get the ferrys .	14159	"The extras cost us about 600pounds for the two of us , and about 400euros for two of us ."	14160	We did this tour in 2008 it was great .	04161	"We did everything , but all ciuld change in two years time ."	04162	I think the crossing from Holyhead to Dublin takes about 2.5 hours .	14163	The only money you 'll need is for some lunch on the ferry .	14164	The rest will be included in the tour .	14165	"Could someone please help us with the size of the suitcase that goes under the bus , also how much room overhead on the bus for a travel bag etc. ."	04166	"I have looked on the web site , but have been

Insight , there is lots of room between you and the seat in front of you ."	14180	Put it in front of you !	14181	"There is some room to place something under your seat , just ahead of the foot rest below ."	14182	I am considering a wheeled duffel style since we will be doing some independent travel before and after and want one that will be able to be converted into a backpack .	14183	"The problem is that although the duffel bags fit the length requirement , they are a different shape from a traditional suitcase so they are a bit `` square '' on the other measurements ."	14184	I am also wondering about the luggage size restrictions for the coach .	04185	We already have one large suitcase that just scrapes in on the size requirements but are considering purchasing another bag as our next biggest bag is quite a bit smaller .	04186	If they are the same litreage as the allowable size does this matter ?	04187	Or does Insight prefer them to all be traditional shape ?	04188	Shape does n't matter .	14189	My main luggage bag is a wheeled duffel .	14190	You wo n't have a problem with that .	14191	The volume dimensions are within their guidelines .	14192	"Remember , it 's not the shape of the luggage they 're concerned about , it 's the weight and the wheeled duffel wo n't be any heavier if it comes out to roughly the same size ."	14193	"So , the wheeled duffel with a carry-on -LRB- that has no wheels -RRB- is fine ."	14194	I did n't want to get all the way there and then find out that I could n't bring my luggage !	04195	"Before you leave home , please contact your Bank or CC \/ Debit card supplier and tell them you _è__è_ ll be away , for how long , and what countries you _è__è_ ll be visiting ."	14196	This will make things alot easier for you .	14197	If you don _è__è_ t you may find your cards blocked and you _è__è_ ll have to make costly call to Banks etc. The security \/ fraud dept of each card will block cards where

mid-morning `` coffee '' stop , a noon stop , a mid-afternoon stop , and then you reach your destination ."	14213	"On a two night stay in one city , you wo n't spend much time on the coach unless you take an optional that is out of town ."	14214	There is a wealth of information on this board .	14215	"Hi , Kristy ."	04216	I recommend you modify your listing so that instead of showing your e-mail

sister company -RRB- are very helpful .	14219	"I recommend you take some time to read the various postings and then if you still have specific questions , ask away !"	14220	The experienced

the destination .	04225	"On July 1st we begin our tour `` European Spotlight '' accordingly , we visit major cities of London , Amsterdam , and Paris ."	04226	Do we need dress-up clothes -LRB- eg .	04227	"suit jacket for men , dresses for the ladies ?"	04228	"In a word no , we usually do the smart casual thing ."	14229	"HOWEVER , that being said , read Rick Steve 's guide on how not to stand out either , my husband wears smart black jeans and a smart casual shirt with dark walking shoes like `` Rockport '' He has a lightweight slack for Italy , Spain etc and takes a smart leather jacket -LRB- not his best one -RRB-"	14230	I usually wear a skirt or dress most days as I find that more comfortable for long days on the coach .	14231	"I also have what I call `` Church clothes '' If I know that I will be going to visit a church , which I guess is the whole of France and Italy , I dress with the due respect I would expect to see in my own church and indeed many times have seen people made to cover up before they go in , one woman on my last tour was just refused entry at St Peters and not even given the chance to cover up !"	14232	"Most people just change into a nicer top for the dinners , you are so on the go the you really do n't have time to dress up and I could n't count the times I have come home with most of my case unused ."	14233	"Enjoy your tour , the packing thing is difficult , the golden rule is not to take clothes just in case !"	14234	I wear just slip on shoes with a padded sole and take warm boots as well .	04235	I know whatever we wear we stand out like tourists but I do try to blend in as much as I can .	04236	"For my next trip in August , which is for 4 weeks , I intend to take under 10kg with we , one dress -LRB- my church one , its longer -RRB- one pair of jeans , two skirts , 6 tops and my leather jacket and some layered tops that go over everything ."	04237	"I usually dress up my clothes at night with a nice belt or scarf , I guess I travel to see not to be seen ."	04238	As per my opinion I do n't think so .	04239	Totally agree - wear comfortable dressy casual clothes and avoid anything that screams tourist - white running shoes and baseball caps as an example .	14240	Enjoy your trip - remember to pack lightly with nothing in your suitcase that you are not going to wear at least 3 times and take a few accessories to dress up your everyday outfits .	14241	No as per my opinion there is no need to do that .	04242	It 's pretty hard not to look like a tourist when you are traveling in a group .	04243	I would n't worry about what you wear .	04244	If anybody is coming to the UK with any # UK20 notes from a previous trip then please check that they have the picture of ` Adam Smith ' on the rear of them .	14245	If you have any with the composer ` Elgar ' on them then change them asap as these will not be legal tender after June 30th 2010 .	14246	"Hi , kindly ' Note ' ..."	04247	"Thanks for that info , have n't heard that from anywhere else , good idea just to order in 50 's"	14248	As of July 1st British Banks are NOT obliged to accept the ` Elgar ' ones for exchange so trade them now back into dollars if you have any is my advice .	14249	"Failure to do so means that you will need to take them to the Bank of England , as per the link below ."	14250	A little more information for you ...	04251	I went our bank in the city today with my British 20 pound notes and they swapped them for me .	14252	They told me they do n't do this normally so no more Elgar notes .	14253	They also told me they did n't know anything about the change of the note either .	14254	What is the best way to phone home from Italy .	04255	Has anyone used the ekit phone you can get through insight and how expensive was it ?	04256	Or is it better just to get an international phone card ?	04257	We take our cell phone and make it international roaming for a few months .	14258	Costs about $ 5 a month .	14259	Phone calls are around .95 cents a minute .	14260	"Real convenient , and can be a real life saver if you loose your credit card or something ."	14261	Also we take an AT	14262	Less than .03 cents a minute .	14263	I used an ekit card when I traveled doing Road to Rome last year with Insight .	14264	I found it extremely convenient .	14265	Do n't forget to load it before you leave .	14266	I put $ 50.00 on it last year .	14267	"Basically you put in the International code of the country from which you are calling , then dial your personal number with area code ."	14268	"You can use it anywhere , at least I did ."	14269	It did me the whole trip .	04270	I used it often .	04271	The directions are with it .	04272	I have a cell but it only works in North America .	04273	I 'm doing `` Country Roads of Italy in Sept. and will use it again .	04274	All the international code are supplied on the back of the card .	14275	Sorry i forgot .	04276	I contacted Virgin -LRB- my provider here -RRB- and they suggested that global roaming would be very expensive and that it would be better to organise a pre-paid sim card once I am in Europe .	14277	I am wanting to take my Australian iPhone to Europe and the UK in June .	04278	"I do n't want to use my phone for many calls , just data since I can easily e-mail home or twitter \/ facebook to keep in touch ."	04279	I did some googling and found a site that said getting a pre-paid sim is quite difficult OS since terrorists use pre-paid phones to set off bombs etc so you have to have three color copies of your passport photo and a whole heap of other i.d. and it might take a whole day hanging around a phone store to get it sorted out .	04280	Is it really this hard ?	04281	Has anyone bought a pre-paid sim recently ?	04282	I intend buying it in London as soon as we arrive -LRB- since I can only speak English this would be simpler -RRB- .	04283	Can I get a pre-paid data card ?	04284	"Hi , I 'm going on Italian Escapade in July and would like to know if men and women are wearing shorts in Italy ."	04285	I know we ca n't wear them in churches but how about while touring ?	04286	Shorts are fine in the summer in Italy as lond as they 're not short shorts .	14287	"I know I am in the minority when it comes to proper dress for vacations , but just do"	14288	"Europeans are much smarter dressers than Americans , but as long as they are not short shorts you should be fine ."	14289	The days you are in churches you might opt for slacks or a skirt .	14290	"Have a great trip , I am leaving for Turkey in 2 weeks !"	04291	"Sorry , I was about to get on my soapbox , but thought better ."	04292	I am wondering whether ladies -LRB- or men -RRB- are allowed to carry a hand bag as well as a cabin bag on the plane .	04293	I have looked on the Qantas web site and British Airways site but ca n't seem to find the answer .	04294	Does anyone know .	04295	We have been on several flights overseas with Qantas and BA and never had any trouble .	14296	"In fact I usually have a cabin bag , a handbag or camera bag and a walking stick ."	14297	I have heard from other people that BA are getting more strict and will only allow one bag .	14298	"The last time we flew BA I had two bags , but I believe things are changing , especially as there seems to be less room now that the wheeled bags are being used ."	04299	I think this rule depends on the security situation at the time .	14300	"For a while , we were only allowed to take one bag through security at Heathrow ."	14301	I had to be able to stuff my purse into my carry-on .	14302	Then Heathrow relaxed the rule .	14303	After the most recent security alarm in the U.S. they were using that one-bag rule for a while and that one bag could not include anything with wheels .	14304	"Now , I believe you can only have one carry-on plus a computer , camera or purse etc. ."	14305	"So , I think the answer is that you have to check to see what the situation is at the time you travel ."	14306	-LRB- Now that 's a challenge ! -RRB-	04307	The following link will take you to the BA site but checking closer to the time is best .	14308	Hi I have noticed on my upcoming tour that I have some free time to explore in Bratislava -LRB- maybe 2 hours -RRB- does anyone have any suggestions of what I could do in this short time .	04309	I do n't want to waste my time there .	04310	It is a historic City and it contains a number of medieval castles \/ fortifications plus there is the river of course .	14311	A delightful location in my opinion .	14312	You could head for Bratislava Castle which is the seat of the Hungarian Kings and Queens of old .	14313	It has a wonderful museum .	14314	Or maybe just a walk in the castle grounds and by the riverside etc. ...	14315	If neither of these options are pleasing to you then you may have booked the wrong trip .	04316	"Our local guide , Martin , had written a pictorial guide souvenir book which many of us purchased ."	14317	It is a lovely souvenir and I think it would be helpful for anyone walking about on their own

so what size or type -LRB- eg duffel bag or small case with wheels -RRB- am I allowed to take with me ?	04326	The storage space above your coach seat is much less than on an aeroplane .	14327	Insight used to provide a free carry on bag which measured 11 `` H x 15 `` W x 7 `` D approximately and was soft and that size fitted in the overhead tray on the coach .	14328	Some people bring normal roll-on carry-on 's and load them in the storage area under the bus each day but they will be largely inaccessible during the day .	14329	"My wife and I have always each used a small backpack which contains water , camera gear , tissues , travel books , stationery , pharmaceuticals , lightweight waterproof jacket and sometimes a foldup umbrella ."	14330	We place these on the floor of the coach under the seat in front and my wife uses them as an additional footrest .	14331	"Travelling in cold regions like Switzerland , we will place a coat or sweater on the overhead rack ."	14332	I want to take my backpack as carry on luggage but the length is 18 '' not 15 '' .	04333	Do you think they will allow it on the bus .	04334	As long as it does n't have wheels .	14335	A backpack squishes nicely into the overhead compartment .	14336	We hope to be completing the 34 day European Heritage Tour or similar in September .	04337	The final decision on coach tour group will depend on how much space we have between seats .	04338	I am of solid build and at 6 ' 3 '' have long legs .	04339	When I fly I always try for the extra leg room seats in the emergency aisles because if I travel economy my knees stick into the seat in front .	04340	When traveling this time we will fly business class for the extra leg room .	04341	Using the information above can any one honestly and accurately tell me how much room the seating offers in the insight coach as from what I can see I would like to travel with them .	04342	Do n't worry .	14343	"If you go to the `` video '' section of this website , and play the `` Welcome to Insight '' video , you will see the legroom being demonstrated by John Boulding , our CEO ."	14344	John is at least 6 ' 4 '' at he has BAGS of legroom !	04345	Paul Fisher -LRB- Tour Director -RRB-	04346	seat space on an Insight bus	14347	My husband is also 6 ' 3 '' and he has no trouble with the knee space .	14348	here is a photo I took on one of our tours :	04349	"Last edited by : ZGordon , 10 March 2010 22:05"	04350	"Generally the space is great , but sometimes some seats are a little closer together and often there is a little less legroom at the seat behind the back side door and also the first seat on each side ."	14351	"My son is 6 ' 5 '' and he was comfortable , and so is my 6 ' 1 '' husband who is a lot heavier and wider than our son ."	14352	"I find the busses very comfortable , I am 5 ' 10 '' and this is one reason we travel with Insight ."	14353	There are many different types of busses .	04354	"Great photo , ZGordon , I never thought of taking a photo of the leg space ."	04355	"The individual vehicles will vary depending on manufacturer but from my experience , the Insight coaches should accommodate your height quite well ."	14356	They truly do reconfigure the seats to allow more space .	14357	I found that there was not only enough space for my legs but also for me to keep my carry-on bag at my feet and still be comfortable .	14358	That 's one of the reasons that I select an Insight tour over others .	04359	Thank you all for your response .	04360	The photo helped a lot .	04361	We are looking forward to our world trip and spending some time with Insight Tours .	04362	hi our tour is not till sept so our travel agent has nothing through from insight yet for item 10 on the visa appl .	04363	-LRB- number of tour voucher -RRB-	04364	can anyone whoa has prev applied for their russian visa advise how long before their trip - they got the insight voucher \/ letter and how long it took to get the visa ?	04365	any info gratefully rec 'd	04366	"I 've put down a deposit with a tentative date of May 8th and have yet to pay for the tour , but Trafalgar emailed all the docs to my TA within a couple weeks ."	14367	"The process wo n't take that long , so I expect to pay for the tour in March and send off the visa stuff then ."	14368	"So , if you have n't heard anything by May , I 'd get your TA to give Insight a call ."	14369	I 'm doing the Scandinavia\/Russia train tour with Trafalgar in May or June .	04370	I have n't filled anything out yet cause the date is n't confirmed .	04371	So that was five months in advance .	04372	I e-mailed our travel agent in Brisbane to ask about our visas for Russia and she referred us to the following link .	14373	If you go to the top right hand corner of the page you are currently on there is a section called `` Travel Tips '' and there is a section in this named `` Passport and Visa FAQ ''	14374	"We are on the Russia , Warsaw and the Baltic States tour leaving Warsaw on May 20 ."	04375	This will answer some of your questions .	04376	We plan to commence our applications for a Tourist Voucher and Russian Visa about 2 and a half months before we leave .	04377	When we arrived home we had an e-mail message to state that they have commenced processing our application .	14378	I found the instructions to be reasonably easy to follow and Insight includes an itinerary which you need to attach to your application .	14379	"We completed all the paperwork for our Russian visas yesterday and dropped the applications , together with our passports to their receiving office in Brisbane about 10am on Thursday ."	04380	We are flying with Emirates from Australia to Europe with a 5 hr stop over for re-fueling in Dubi .	04381	Can anyone offer any insight into Dubi airport and suggestions for what to do in this time ?	04382	"Dubai airport is massive , and there are a lot of shops there - mostly normal airport-type shopping , but there are also some shops where you can get some quality souvenirs of Dubai ."	14383	"You may take a while to get through the formalities , so the time you have there probably wo n't be enough to leave the airport to see anything ."	14384	"There are plenty of places to eat , and coffee shops - but expensive ."	14385	There is also free wireless internet available in the lounges if that 's any good to you .	14386	The airport does have alot of lounges that you can sleep on but these were always taken .	14387	lots of people were alseep on the floor as well .	14388	You can only look and shop for so long so unfortunately you will have time on your hands .	14389	We had a stopover for the same duration and it really did drag due to the long haul from Australia to Dubai .	04390	"I booked well ahead of our holiday and was given this flight by my TA thinking this was the only available flight but it turned out that there were others who had a connecting flight within an hour of the Australia-Dubai leg , so i was pretty annoyed we did n't get that flight ."	04391	Dubai airport has so much to see and do .	14392	BUT if do you buy something to take home do not buy the fur covered camels .	14393	Quarantine will take them off you and destroy them .	14394	"The painted camels and donkeys are fine , but anything with sticks or stuffed saddle bags you lose ."	14395	We were lucky we only lost the sticks and bags off ours but some of the camels are very well glued and if Quarantine ca n't dismantle it safely you lose it .	14396	Just thought I would mention it because when we got to Quarantine and said we had wooden items and stopped over in Dubai the Quarantine officer groaned and said `` tell me you did n't buy a camel '' Oops .	14397	Just a heads up .	14398	"We had heaps to declare - food -LRB- candy -RRB- wooden objects , a horn cup and a whole heap of stuff on the declare it or lose it list and we only lost the sticks and bags off our camel and a wooden christmas decoration ."	14399	it 's hard to choose	04400	The lady was really nice about it too .	04401	#NAME?	14402	hi we are flying with emirates but are breaking the journey overnight in dubai -LRB- having had 12 hours from perth -RRB- but have you checked out the airport website ?	04403	We are flying with Singapore Airlines to Athens and have a 3 hour stopover at Changi .	04404	Does anyone know if they have showers we can use before the next long leg of our journey ?	04405	All three terminals offer shower facilities as part of their Spas .	14406	There is a charge of course .	14407	The charge will be well worth it after 8 hours flying and another 12 to go .	14408	We got massages in between .	04409	Britian\/Ireland Explorer 25 August 2009	04410	Im pretty sure you can even go and use the pool at a charge ?	04411	i think its terminal 3 but if you have the time check out the room called oceanus -LRB- i think that 's what its called -RRB- full of free auto-massage chairs etc - absolute bliss - download a map of the airport before you go	14412	The lounge that janek64 referred to is the Oasis Lounge and it has free chair massages .	14413	An interactive map of Changi Airport can be found at Changi Interactive Map and general airport information on airport amenities etc can be found at Airport Guide .	14414	A a list of possible activities to pass the time during your stopover can also be found at Suggested Activities	14415	Hi fellow Novocastrian Wren	04416	Have a great trip to Greece .	04417	I used the Rainforest lounge in Terminal 1 .	14418	They have really great shower facilities .	14419	I took advantage of the masseus on outgoing and incoming flights .	14420	"I had a fantastic masseus on the way back last time , she managed to get rid of a knot I had had in my shoulder for weeks ."	14421	I guess it depends on which terminal you are in .	04422	thinking of going on this tour in September how cool should we expect the Orkney Islands to be ?	04423	"I know Britain can be lovely , but Scotland could be a different matter !"	04424	I was in Scotland last July and it was wet and cool on some days and other days were sunny and warm -LRB- and that was the middle of summer !	14425	"The Orkney Islands are very North and cool weather would be the norm , but do not let the weather put you off going to such a spectacular part of the UK ."	14426	Just pack clothing for any type of weather and you can not go wrong !	14427	quote : Originally posted by Ghil :	04428	"I fell in love with Scotland , everything about this part of Britain is beautiful , and I am going back there again this July"	04429	If you do go on this tour just pack a warm jumper	14430	You will not regret your decision if you do book this tour .	14431	It covers all	14432	We did this tour in July 2008	04433	The day to the Orkney Islands was a day I will not forget it was wonderful .	04434	we did the european Heritage last September so was in UK about the same time as our proposed trip and it was mostly warm to hot even on some days .	14435	I realize that it would be a lot colder in the highlands and we will have to have a selection of cool to warm clothing this time !	14436	Thanks for your comments .	04437	we are pretty sold on this trip .	04438	We did this tour in Sept. 2008 and I can tell you we never needed warm clothing .	14439	The weather was rather cool in Scotland to say the least .	14440	It is a much easier holiday than the European trips not such long days .	04441	We had a great time and people that were with us done it again last year .	04442	There will be great cool in both destrinations	14443	I will be booking the Best of Italy tour in September .	04444	Any advice on airfare ?	04445	"I think we will just book it through Insight , at our Travel Agent 's advice ."	04446	Do you really get a good deal on airfare ?	04447	We 're thinking we 'd like to take the British Airways flight and book the premium economy so we 'll have access to the in flight movies .	04448	Our main reason for flying British Air is the very comfortable seats in World Traveller Plus .	14449	Lots of leg room !	14450	We have always booked our own flights because the Insight office in Toronto has never given us a good deal on flights - our TA does better .	14451	Has anyone recently had to transit through Heathrow Airport Terminal 3 to Terminal 5 .	04452	I would like to know how long it took as I have only be given 90 minutes between flights and I have been told that I need at least 3 hours due to all the security checks .	04453	"I have done this on a few occasions , but generally with two to three hours to play with ."	14454	When you travel in transit the security checks are fairly painless and quick .	14455	Usually once you arrive at the first terminal you follow all the signs directing in-transit passengers .	14456	"-LRB- generally your luggage should be checked through so you do n't have to collect it and re-check it in -RRB- You hop on the bus to the terminal you need to go to , usually around a 15 to 20 minute ride ."	14457	"Once you arrive at your terminal you place your hand luggage on the conveyer to be screened , walk through the security check - show your passport and go right through to the departure area ."	14458	You can either go directly to your gate or if you have time - browse the shops .	14459	"I would be a little nervous though with only 90 minutes , only because some flights are delayed , but so long as your first flight is on time , you will be fine ."	14460	You should be ok .	04461	"At Heathrow the checks take so long , as you almost have to strip off and the staff are rather slow in my opinion -LRB- nor are they happy folk either ! -RRB-"	14462	"That is good advice Gen , but my only worry would be going through security checks again , especially if the line ups are long ."	04463	"Langers , each time I have done it , it has been really fast ."	14464	"You go in through a back entrance , not the front door ."	14465	"Each time I have checked my luggage in at the airport in Europe , and it has been checked onto the continuing flight to Australia ."	14466	No long lines at all .	04467	Only snag I would see is if you were not traveling on the same airline .	04468	Not sure what happens there .	04469	Mine were British Airways for the Europe flight to London Heathrow then Qantas .	04470	With recent events in the US security has been tightened even further at UK airports and travellers including those transferring have been warned about longer queues and motr checks .	14471	I would ask your travel agent to check the current situation .	14472	"London Heathrow is not perfect , but they are better than in the past , especially with BA 's new terminal -LRB- s -RRB- ."	14473	Does anyone have any view about the fitness level that someone would need to enjoy this tour .	04474	Am planning on the Oberammergau option but must admit I spend too much time in front of a computer and not enough time getting exercise .	04475	I could get some training in between now and then -LRB- 6 months to go -RRB- .	04476	Aussiejoy you will discover that you will be doing a fair amount of walking around the different cities visited .	14477	You do n't need to worry though as all ages and fitness levels travel on Insight Tours .	14478	I did the Country Roads of Italy tour last year and that involved a lot of steep walks and stairs - there was an 84 year old gentleman with us an he coped admirably .	14479	"Your courier will make sure everyone is able to keep up , remember you do n't have to race you are walking to look at something ."	14480	The courier is there to help and if you feel you ca n't keep up let them know and they will slow the pace .	14481	"Try to do some regular walking before you go and , as many people will agree , make sure you have comfortable walking shoes that you have broken in before you leave ."	14482	You will have a wonderful time .	04483	Thanks Yoni -- Good to have your first hand experience .	04484	"I am still at the thinking stage , but I have found most of your posts very helpful ."	04485	We are leaving for Jordan and Egypt in 13 days and have been trying to find out what power adaptor we need for our camera and hair dryer .	04486	"Just wondered if past travellers from Australia could advise , please ."	04487	they use the same 2 pin sockets and plugs as most of Europe .	14488	See : http://www.levoyageur.net/plug-country-Egypt.html .	14489	The mains voltage is 220 volts .	14490	Thanks Phil for your help .	04491	"However , in the Marriott in Cairo our room had standard UK plugs ."	14492	That is three rectangular pins .	14493	I believe Phil is correct in general .	04494	We will take both to be sure .	04495	"This time next week mys sister and I will be nearly in Vienna after flying for nearly 20 hours , so exciting , can hardly wait !"	04496	After all the planning and packing it 's nearly here .	04497	"Cheers , Jenny ."	04498	Apart from the 2 countries not cover on the Insight Tour and where some of the accommodation is located the tours are very similar .	14499	If you can do the optional tours they are worth the money .	14500	I hope that you enjoy the Tour .	04501	I did this tour with Trafalgar in June this year and it was very interesting .	04502	The history of this part of the world was great so of it I had not known before as we were never told much about this part of Europe .	04503	I went with Trafalgar this time because of where the tour went to and that was the only reason for doing so .	04504	Next trip will be again with Insight .	04505	"We thought about Trafalgar at first , but we love the idea of more legroom and it seems like the hotels are more centrally located on the Insight tours ."	14506	I 'm curious since you have been with both .	04507	How would your compare the Insight tours from Trafalgar ?	04508	Lake Bled was beautiful .	14509	If Insight had of covered these places I would have gone with them but when paying a lot of money for a tour it has to go to the place you want to go to .	14510	Saying that Insight and Trafalgar are the only companies that I would ever think of going with .	14511	It is my opinion that they are the best .	14512	"Insight coaches do have more leg room the hotel are in a better location , there is less people on the tour and all these things make a difference ."	14513	Both have excellent accommodation .	14514	Many of the place that you visit with both companies are the same if you are doing a First class tour with Trafalgar but not all sometimes you may not visit a place just see it and also the optional extras are most of the time the same but not always .	14515	It is up to the individual to decide but as many others on the BB have said it is where the tour takes you that is important .	14516	I went with Trafalgar for this tour as it went to Slovenia and Croatia .	04517	I wanted to see these 2 countries and was not disappointed with either .	04518	I know this is last minute but my travel agent has not been able to arrange anything for me for my transfer from the Nice Hotel to the airport .	04519	I have an early flight so will need to go to the airport early .	04520	Is there an airport shuttle that can be arranged to get me from the hotel to the airport ?	04521	"Last time I took a taxi it cost me 159 Euro 's , which I believe is daylight robbery ."	04522	"I only have one more sleep so I if anyone can advise me before I go tomorrow , I guess I will be lucky !"	04523	in anticipation - thank you	04524	I was in Nice in July and the hotel arranged a transfer for me which cost about 30 Euros .	14525	It was n't an early flight so I assume there would be a supplement but probably not over 100 Euro .	14526	The one taxi I took in Noce was extremely expensive .	14527	Hopefully this will help .	04528	Enjoy your trip and I look forward to hearing about it when you return .	04529	Check these out but it might be too late to do anything before you fly out tomorrow .	14530	"Hi everyone , I have had something come up in regards to booking a hotel room through Insight for 1 day before our tour starts ."	14531	I thought it might be good advise for those considering doing the same thing .	14532	"We booked a room at the Victoria Park Plaza -LRB- our tour hotel -RRB- in London through Insight , in May for our September tour of Europe ."	14533	The cost of our room was a lot cheaper than what we paid through Insight .	14534	It would have been cheaper for us to skip the transfer and pay the hotel ourselves .	14535	"Insight should charge only what the current hotel rate is when the room is booked not at a premium rate and also the transfer cost is included in your tour price in London anyways , whether you come a day early or not ."	14536	Lesson learned : Next time book my own hotel and not through Insight .	14537	The other day I went onto the hotel site to check on what the rooms were like .	04538	I remember a discussion on the Bulletin Board about this before .	04539	I Emailed Insight and their reasons were 1 .	04540	"They book the hotels early in the season and although the hotel might change their rates , Insight does not and 2 ."	04541	they include a hotel transfer .	04542	"Although I am disappointed in how Insight has handled my problem , I am still looking forward with lots of excitment for our trip in September -LRB- European Explorer -RRB- ."	04543	"When booking through the tour company , you are quoted a price `` per person '' ."	14544	The hotel may charge the same rate `` per room '' .	14545	This is pretty standard .	04546	"Maggie May , quote : It would have been cheaper for us to skip the transfer and pay the hotel ourselves ."	04547	If you check Insights Terms	04548	"As an example , the Dot2Dot transfer service from Heathrow costs about # 21.50 per person -LRB- each way -RRB- ."	04549	I always check rates on the internet and with my travel agent and Insight before I book .	14550	At the moment the rates are all over the place which I guess would make it difficult for companies who have to book a long time in advance .	14551	I did have a similar issue in Oslo many years ago and since then I 've looked everywhere I can to find rates .	04552	With tourism taking a hit the last couple of years I would n't hesitate to asking for the `` best '' price available .	14553	Working through your travel agent might get you an additional discount .	14554	On the Easy Pace Russia -LRB- St Petersburg	04555	I also recall remarks about bringing towels	04556	Is that really necessary ?	04557	We will be on the tour in late September so any swimming pools would have to be indoors .	04558	"Firstly the hotel in St Petersburgh does not have a swimming pool , whilst the Crowne in Moscow does have an inside pool attached to the health\/spa facilities ."	14559	If you are a swimmer and would like to get up earlier or have a swim later then bring a swimsuit .	14560	You may have a stop over on the way home that you need it for .	14561	"Also if you decide not to take one of the optionals you may have time , but again , there is a lot to see around the amazing cities and that may be more important to you ."	14562	"However , the tour is full on ."	14563	"There are lots of optionals and the free time in between seemed to be taken up with deciding on souvenirs , food or spending lots of time taking photos or enjoying the different surroundings ."	14564	We hardly had time to eat we were so busy looking at things or enjoying the optionals .	14565	As to the towels - you wont need towels .	14566	Washclothes are a personal preference .	14567	Bring one if you really like to use it and then you wont need to worry .	14568	Cant recall what was in each room now but I know we used small towels sometimes as clothes or bath mats were necessary in some Scandinavian hotels so the Russian ones are a slight blur in that regard even though it was so recent !	14569	We enjoyed it very much and the tour guides in each of the cities were lovely and extremely knowledgeable about their cities and Russian history and culture .	14570	Have just returned from this tour so these are my thoughts about it :	04571	I am still behind in finishing my diary as well .	04572	Have a fab time and let me know if you want to ask anything else .	04573	Am hoping to post photos and then diary soonish .	04574	We have found that there always are hotels in Europe that do not supply wash cloths -LRB- even upscale ones . -RRB-	14575	We take some J-cloths and leave them behind .	14576	"In Europe , what you call a `` wash cloth '' is regarded as a `` personal item '' which the guest brings with them , like a toothbrush ."	14577	Hence they are not generally supplied .	14578	quote : Originally posted by ZGordon :	04579	Hello experienced travellers .	04580	"My question might seem dumb , but here it is ..."	04581	"I am traveling to UK , Morocco , and Dubai , and am wondering about electricial appliances ."	04582	"I know I need and adaptor to convert the shape of the power point , but what about converting the current ."	04583	Is that necessary in those countries ?	04584	"I am in Australia , and only have phone \/ camera \/ laptop chargers ."	04585	I hope I am making sense .	04586	You do not need any convertor for those countries .	14587	As you said you will just need the different plugs .	14588	"As far as being a ` dumb ' question , my attitiude is the only dumb question is the one

do n't ask you do n't find out !"	04592	"If you do n't want to buy a plug , the hotels always have them available ."	14593	The best plug I have ever bought is one that you can change for whatever country you visit -LRB- multifunctional bit like the changeable blocks !	14594	that way you do n't need to carry heaps .	14595	I bought mine on an international flight .	14596	I bought an adaptor and my electrical devices still got fryed .	14597	I found most hotels you did not need anything .	14598	If there was not a hairdryer in the room there would be one at the front desk .	14599	I wish I had left everything at home .	04600	Thought we needed a new discussion !	04601	I have been thinking about souvenirs and what to to bring home from the Northern areas .	04602	There are a number of suggested things to buy in Eyewitness and Lonely Planet books but I thought I could pick the BB 's brains for the best places to get certain things eg daughter number two would like one of the wooden Swedish horses - I think we visit a factory ?	04603	Is that the best place to get one ?	04604	I could buy one in Melbourne but that would spoil the fun .	04605	Are street stalls or shops the best place to get Matryoshka Dolls ?	04606	-LRB- Who has one like Lenin etc ?	04607	Fake Soviet Memorabilia ?	04608	Also for those who have been to these areas - what did you bring back that you are pleased with and brings you pleasant memories ?	04609	If you opt to go to Tallinn or Riga then you could do worse than to consider their ` glass and\/or amber ' products .	14610	"You can of course have real or fake , just a question of who it is for and how much you wish to pay for it ."	04611	"Either way it did seem , to us , to reflect our memories of these particular Baltic states ."	04612	Yes - I think the other half might still `` owe '' me some amber as I could n't decide on a necklace in Bratislava in 07 so I got nothing !	04613	"Eve , unfortunately I do n't believe you will visit the Dala horse factory in Sweden ."	04614	"They are traditionally made in the province of Dalarna , northwest of Stockholm ."	04615	"The Spectacular Scandinavia tour goes through Mora , I

their own currencies ."	15012	"You may find that some places will still accept Euros , but I would be changing some money over on arrival into each country if it was me -LRB- or withdrawing some from an ATM -RRB- , and just leaving home with Euros on hand and my credit card !"	15013	I 'm sure your tour director will be able to advise you of what you might need at the beginning of the tour .	15014	I purchased currencies from my bank branch before my departure and did well .	15015	"In tourist areas , I found that shops will often take euros as well as the local currency ."	15016	I took the following amount in cash -LRB- for me traveling alone -RRB- as well as having my VISA charge card and bank card for ATM withdrawals -LRB- both of which did not use -RRB- with me :	15017	I paid for the optional excursions with my VISA card .	15018	I had enough cash left at the end of the trip to cover the driver and TD trips as well and converted back leftover cash at the airport when I processed my VAT refund .	15019	"FYI , I do n't spend a lot of money on meals so you will need to judge according to your own travel style ."	15020	I took this tour in October and thought it was
