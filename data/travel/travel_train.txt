__label__1 ` Travel Tips
__label__0 I have booked air twice through Insight and in both instances paid more than the brochure price to get the airline and routing that I wanted , not taking into account the additional amount I would have to pay anyway to get to Toronto or Montreal .
__label__1 Just a heads up .
__label__1 Go to FIND and type in `` tipping . ''
__label__0 We had to change rooms at 11:00 the first night because the bathroom lights shorted out after my leaky shower .

__label__1 Remember , it 's not the shape of the luggage they 're concerned about , it 's the weight and the wheeled duffel wo n't be any heavier if it comes out to roughly the same size .
__label__0 I am still at the thinking stage , but I have found most of your posts very helpful .
__label__1 As of July 1st British Banks are NOT obliged to accept the ` Elgar ' ones for exchange so trade them now back into dollars if you have any is my advice .

__label__0 Have done it several times priceline.com
__label__0 I was able to use the web and send and receive email whenever I could get Wi-Fi .
__label__1 I also have what I call `` Church clothes '' If I know that I will be going to visit a church , which I guess is the whole of France and Italy , I dress with the due respect I would expect to see in my own church and indeed many times have seen people made to cover up before they go in , one woman on my last tour was just refused entry at St Peters and not even given the chance to cover up !

__label__0 What is the procedure for asking for assistance with negotiating around the site ?
__label__0 I never saw it as a `` hard word '' .
__label__0 Each country has their own postage system and cost for postage varies .
__label__0 I use Hertz a lot .
__label__0 Easiest way is to fly .
__label__1 The charge will be well worth it after 8 hours flying and another 12 to go .

__label__0 The choice is quite simple ...
__label__0 Maybe they were talking about some kind of wallet .

__label__0 Until this thread came up , I would n't have thought of bringing something to keep my shower items off the floor .
__label__1 I try to NEVER give them any reason for picking on me , no wallets in eye view , no cords around my neck that obviously have a wallet on the end , its really important to keep your wits about you , but tens of thousands of tourists every day have no trouble .

__label__1 The overhead storage space on the coach is quite small and as an indication , it has enough space to accommodate one of the Insight bags that used to be provided to travellers -LRB- but no longer -RRB- .

__label__0 Late May or JUne .

__label__1 If you can do it as part of an optional tour that is best , you will get good comentary and they may even show you the old Appian Way the remains of which is close by , not a mind blowing experience but it is one of those `` I 've been there '' moments particularly for history buffs .

__label__0 2011 Italian Escapades we were amazed how simple things had improved from previous years there as the couple with us just bought a Wi Fi sim stick from a local carriers shop for 29-95 for 3 gigs and they found it plenty for reading and sending with family and heaps cheaper than using others Wi FI , as others have stated that it is expensive most places .
__label__0 Am a NAUI\/PADI Instructor you have been to nice places my
__label__0 in anticipation - thank you
__label__0 stayhawaii.com where I go volcanoes beaches shopping

__label__0 While I would never wear shorts in Paris or Rome , I would -LRB- and do -RRB- wear them in Nice or Tuscany .
__label__0 It looks fabulous .
__label__0 So , even if I was going only overnight , it 's worth it to me .
__label__0 I 'm going with my niece and there are soooo many hotels , and I keep on looking at all the reviews , and I am so mixed up !
__label__0 I was trying to find a reasonable trip for 5 nights to a place w \/ turquoise water and beautiful beaches from N.O. next spring or next fall .
__label__1 By the way , I think the idea behind having only a 1/2 inch of water is that you want to give the ice the chance to melt , should the opportunity present itself .
__label__0 Obviously we ca n't do an in-depth trip , we are looking more for the experience .
__label__0 Also , the Insituto requires a $ 100 life time registration fee which is to be made out to a person here in the USA .
__label__0 Oh , I see you 're new here .
__label__0 I am planning on buying the liquids after security .

__label__1 But even easier is not to bring much to the beach with you .

__label__0 Does anyone know when the 08 optional list comes out ?
__label__1 I have always worn slacks or capris and definitely a top with sleeves -- The scarf would be needed if your top was sleevless or if you wanted to dress up an outfit -- no need to wear something on your head -LRB- I think I did that when we went into mosques -RRB- .
__label__0 Is that really necessary ?
__label__0 I 'm going as to hawaii with a child soon for the first time .

__label__1 Less than .03 cents a minute .
__label__0 Looking for advise from anyone who has traveled to these countries on this or similar tours .
__label__1 With the internet , even a last minute trip , does n't have to mean going to the airport without a ticket , or landing in a city without a place to stay .
__label__0 We had a great time and people that were with us done it again last year .
__label__0 Do you mean the Country Roads of France tour .
__label__0 We use a US based Travel Agent who has helped us plan several trips all over the world .
__label__1 I 'll likely also suggest TripAdvisor for hotels , but I always double-check those TA recommendations here .
__label__0 Let me know what you guys think .

__label__1 Most of the times , since we never allow more than 40 guests on our coaches , there is plenty of space for your carry-on in the compartment of luggage hold next to the front door ; your tour director will assist you in stowing your bag as you board , and you retrieve it when you exit the coach .
__label__0 While I disagreed with the general tenor of this post : http://www.fodors.com/community/travel-tips-trip-ideas/posting-links-to-blogs.cfm - I am getting rather tired of seeing posts from you that are just links .
__label__0 For example , Nashville to Memphis takes 4 hours with 3-4 buses per day at a cost of around $ 50 per person .
__label__0 You come home from your trip .
__label__1 ILoveTravel , I have not stayed at this hotel , but if you do n't get any direct information on th BB , you might try tripadvisor.com .
__label__0 There are a bunch of restaurants , casinos and pools .
__label__1 You could also fly between Nashville and Memphis , but you 'd need ground transport once in town .
__label__1 Do not buy what your company offers almost always more costly
__label__0 That does make sense .
__label__0 Have a gt holiday .
__label__0 I have a friend that works as a travel companion for an agency out of the Tampa Bay area .

__label__0 At that time , Insight went to Bayeux and had preferable Normandy sites my husband wanted to visit .

__label__0 Did an ultramarathon on the southern part
__label__1 A lot of travel agents use this website to check out visa info and hotel ratings , etc. .

__label__1 Hi everyone , I have had something come up in regards to booking a hotel room through Insight for 1 day before our tour starts .
__label__1 I would be very surprised if your laptop needed a converter , but the hair dryer might need one .
__label__1 Take a jacket , umbrella -LRB- get one of the tiny folding ones - you are not always with the bus when the rain starts -RRB- , and sweater .
__label__0 Address Line 1 :
__label__1 There are about 40 different catacombs in Rome , all outside the city walls , I hear .
__label__0 OK so far so good , but I have never seen or heard of a luggage tag that had a zipper .
__label__1 They did 5 tours , combination of Insight and other operators and this one was definatly their highlight .
__label__0 The mosquito nets are over the beds for real - not for rustic charm .
__label__0 Euros , US and Aussie dollars .
__label__1 This therefor becomes + then your country code then your area code then your phone number .
__label__0 Both tours look great any info to help us choose between them would be great
__label__0 We are n't sure where to stay and if we should do an All Inclusive or just a hotel and find out own food .
__label__1 I do n't wish to be discouraging , but I think that you need to pick your tour carefully .
__label__0 Occasional showers are to be expected .

__label__0 I have looked on the Qantas web site and British Airways site but ca n't seem to find the answer .

__label__0 fairmont.com/frontenac by via rail
__label__0 I understand that there is a train from Cefalu to Parlemo about every hour or so
__label__0 Thank you both very much for your responses .
__label__1 They told me they do n't do this normally so no more Elgar notes .
__label__0 We 'd both prefer if my son could go as well , since he loves to travel , and enjoys the kind of history-focused trips my dad plans .
__label__0 I did the same trick to book Carmel Highlands .
__label__0 When we traveled to Australia we used Capital One and Bank of America because they were aligned with PAC West bank .
__label__0 My favorites would be Orkney and the hotel in Thurso is pub standard but worth it for the day trip , skye is of the same standard but again the area is lovely .
__label__0 I have a weird travel question I 'm interested in polling people .
__label__1 However , I believe that not all the options will be offered to you and that at the start of the tour your Director will advise which ones will be available .
__label__0 My husband and I have never used a travel agent before -LRB- aside from work travel -RRB- and have generally been happy and excited to plan our own travel .
__label__0 Any suggestions other than the usual cab ride and does what about the cost ?
__label__1 Enjoy your tour , the packing thing is difficult , the golden rule is not to take clothes just in case !
__label__1 It covers all
__label__0 a few questions on the article :
__label__1 Then , it 's a matter of each optional getting the minimum number of participants to sign up for them .
__label__0 `` I had asked for a window seat on a flight from Saigon to Paris , and was issued with boarding pass 9C .

__label__0 The weather also treated us very well and Mt Pilatus and Eagles Nest were both amazing - we could see for miles .
__label__1 San Francisco would work .
__label__0 Trolley cases can not fit in overhead compartment , of bus .
__label__0 Jos , when you say currency pack - what exactly do you mean - is this something that you can do with Insight while on tour .
__label__0 Is that necessary in those countries ?
__label__0 I thought I 'd try my luck on the way back , and again because my clothes were of a reasonable European brand -LRB- though after 1 week of 30 deg .
__label__0 What is a good way to do this ?
__label__1 So , my advice is take what you absolutely need and love and leave anything else with generous family or friends .
__label__0 I _è__è_ m an Insight Tour Director and I _è__è_ d just like to pass on a bit of travel advice to make your Vacations hassle free .
__label__0 Worth a try if I ca n't get the regular hangars .
__label__1 You 'll want to re-post over on the Europe Forum .

__label__0 While the other 2 have local currency I believe they accept euro as well .
__label__0 We will enjoy our trip only one more sleep , this time tomorrow we will be at the airport , cases are packed and locked and after 12 months planning it is finally happening !
__label__0 It seems our friends in Australia have greater ideas and creations !
__label__0 I love the variety ecodensity and wildlife of Ecuador

__label__1 I guess you would still need to use an ordinary hanger , and then blow up a few different shaped balloons to keep a garment in shape as it dries .
__label__1 I have never had anything but NO bed bugs and very clean .

__label__1 If you go to the top right hand corner of the page you are currently on there is a section called `` Travel Tips '' and there is a section in this named `` Passport and Visa FAQ ''
__label__0 I think that the tour guide was no interested in stopping to show us interesting things , he continually talked about himself etc , was rude especially to woman and not interested in participating with the crew he had to guide .
__label__1 I 'd re-post this over on the United States forum .
__label__0 Any anecdotes about a good or bad seat wo n't make any difference re the particular one you receive .
__label__0 I 'm sure most people will want to go and I probably would too out of curiosity if I had n't done it already .

__label__0 There are a lot of them and some hotels offer it free .
__label__0 The problem there was the speed of the tours .
__label__0 No matter what you do , if you choose to use any insurance policy READ THE FINE PRINT CAREFULLY !
__label__0 The conversation never ends , they just get more irate because you are discussing it but not agreeing with them , it does n't help .
__label__0 Cheers , Jenny .

__label__0 As far as I 'm concerned , another shill .
__label__0 I went with Trafalgar this time because of where the tour went to and that was the only reason for doing so .
__label__1 On a two night stay in one city , you wo n't spend much time on the coach unless you take an optional that is out of town .
__label__1 Take a hat , tshirts , polo shirts , long shorts and naturally very comfortable walking shoes .

__label__0 Hello , we are booked to go on the Highlights of Eastern Europe the end of May .
__label__0 Have traveled with Insight all over Europe and am returning again this year .
__label__0 We have the bank ATM card as you state no VISA , etc debit  just the bank name and have used it at Cirrus and Pulse networks in several countries in Europe without any problem .
__label__0 Tempeture mid teens - 30s .
__label__0 I acknowledge what they say -LRB- not the same thing as agreeing ! -RRB-
__label__1 There tends to be a mid-morning `` coffee '' stop , a noon stop , a mid-afternoon stop , and then you reach your destination .
__label__1 They offer service from Fort Lauderdale to Miami .
__label__1 No flash allowed inside temples but that was Ok because the natural lighting was very good .
__label__0 That was most of the time , but as PaPa says , it was not always free .
__label__1 Talk to the great people at Rick Steves now before you go .
__label__0 Insurance Company Telephone :
__label__0 I 've never found it a hassle to roll a single bag along behind me .
__label__0 I see the tickets for the concerts for June 7-10 , 2012 go on sale next week and the tour operators are taking deposits now for ticket\/accommodation packages .
__label__0 We 've thought about Puerto Rico and Bahamas .
__label__0 We do n't want to do group tours but are mainly interested in having someone help plan a rough agenda for us , book hotels , car rentals\/car services , etc. .
__label__0 Ideally I would like it to be near to the open air theater and either 4 or 5 stars if possible .
__label__1 People who visit Fraser Island for the first time often struggle to find the words to describe the beauty of this magical island .
__label__0 we are doing the britain and ireland discovery tour and were told by the travel agent if we do n't drink and are n't big spenders then 90 pounds each per day should be sufficient
__label__0 We choose by itinerary .
__label__0 Other than that the cost was any where from 9euro to 15euro per day .
__label__0 We are also signed up for the Scavi tour that goes underneath St. Peter 's .
__label__1 One key to ensure that this trip remains economical is by ensuring that all bookings are made well in advance .
__label__0 While Ii like Prague , Budapest is my favorite city .
__label__0 We will be on the tour in late September so any swimming pools would have to be indoors .
__label__0 A few questions :
__label__1 BUT if do you buy something to take home do not buy the fur covered camels .
__label__0 I personally do not think that Prague is a very friendly city .
__label__1 To see the other parts , go down to Tour Tales , select `` Where are all the Tales '' , second entry from the top , and find your tour .
__label__0 I agree , post on the Cruise forum , hardly anyone reads this `` Travel Tips '' branch .
__label__0 I 'm going for a long weekend in Istanbul this coming Friday , and flying via Heathrow , obviously I 'm worried about luggage so am just taking hand luggage -LRB- the maximum size allowed -RRB- .
__label__1 You can take the train from Florence to either Fornaci di Barga or the next stop , Gallicano-Barga .
__label__0 quote : Rome was , regretably , spoiled by the fact that when we arrived in the city , we went straight into sightseeing and then our `` highlight '' dinner , so on the TD 's advice everybody left their hand baggage on the bus .
__label__0 You 'll get a much wider audience if you post on the Europe Forum .
__label__0 Also yes and yes .
__label__1 As a last resort I am also taking my visa but will try not to use it because of the high charges .
__label__0 not sure where u are headed but better deals these days
__label__1 So , check around and find yourself a professional TA who does more than just book hotels .
__label__0 There is a Radisson SAS Royal Hotel opposite Tivoli Garden .
__label__0 better than summer fall lest storms and heat .
__label__1 I recommend you modify your listing so that instead of showing your e-mail address as your location you actually give your geographic location .
__label__0 `` a serious day pack which can carry 50 + lbs , has excellent padding on the straps , and can be fully customized to fit your body to be comfortable for all day hiking . ''
__label__0 First of all , my boyfriend and I are thinking about a trip for his birthday in December .
__label__0 Note : we fly out of Atlanta .
__label__0 Actually , I think this is an appropriate topic for this forum since the OP is looking for an app to use when traveling .
__label__0 Thanks for your comments .
__label__0 What did you want this packable daypack to do for you ?
__label__1 Do n't leave your valuables on a blanket .
__label__0 I am about to go to London and Paris for a few nights and I 've read horror stories about astronomical bills from ATT for using your iPhone abroad .
__label__0 I 've used shuttle services many times in in Paris to\/from CDG and Orly , and have never had a problem .
__label__0 We 'd love to spend less than $ 2565 a night and stay somewhere clean , relaxing and welcoming -LRB- this is our honeymoon -RRB- .
__label__0 Thank you for your help .
__label__0 To make the story short , I got tired of typing and agreed to the charge -LRB- to which btw I had to give my special permission because the new lead party is responsible for all charges -RRB- .
__label__0 Would love to go again , maybe in 2009 .
__label__1 The problem is that although the duffel bags fit the length requirement , they are a different shape from a traditional suitcase so they are a bit `` square '' on the other measurements .
__label__0 Those usually have some kind of internal frame and really do n't `` pack . ''
__label__1 I would n't do a cruise or an organized tour either one .
__label__0 Have just returned from this tour so these are my thoughts about it :
__label__0 They do overplan things !
__label__0 I 'd think it fairly unusual for a tour company .
__label__0 Does anyone know if they have showers we can use before the next long leg of our journey ?
__label__0 We will be doing as much as possible sghtseeing etc in 2 days , so which is the better of the 2 .
__label__0 You 'll want to re-post this over on the Europe forum for more replies -LRB- this Travel Tips branch is just a general catchall for posts on general subjects -RRB- .
__label__0 HAVE FUN
__label__0 But I can see it is a useful site
__label__0 Hi Folks any one recently been to Morocco like the last few weeks and did you feel safe there we be ther the next few days well 30 Days looking forward to it .
__label__0 Is there a recommended location to meet at after clearing customs ?
__label__0 Hi Glen : Thank you for sharing .

__label__1 Give her the cash to put into her account -LRB- that hopefully she has an ATM card she 'll be using to withdraw funds on her trip -RRB- .
__label__1 If the main purpose of the laptop is for travel , consider getting a netbook .
__label__0 Thanks to all !
__label__0 Never had a problem , never been asked .
__label__1 -LRB- `` most countries '' -- Hotwire lies so beautifully -RRB-
__label__0 I will be touring in Spain and Portugal for two weeks .
__label__0 That brings up another question .
__label__1 Be sure to make your Tour Director aware of your situation .
__label__1 Keep them that way and you should have no problems .
__label__0 In case of London there are numerous flights to Bratislava .
__label__0 We usually carryon a small rollie each , plus tote or bookbag .
__label__0 I like bing.com for its fare predictor -LRB- i. e , recommends whether you should buy or wait based on whether they think the price will go up or down -RRB- .
__label__0 never hotwire for flights but lots for hotels they are good
__label__0 I was wondering whether capri pants were considered appropriate ?
__label__1 Just be careful ... many items are interesting but really not necessary
__label__0 I have to travel to Catania Italy last part of September .
__label__0 However , at this same hotel , when in our room our phones detected secure networks for nearby hotels across the street -LRB- it was in downtown Florence -RRB- and our laptop could access the wireless network .
__label__1 What your friends likely mean is that LGA is closer to Midtown and easier to reach from most of New York .
__label__0 I have been thinking about souvenirs and what to to bring home from the Northern areas .
__label__0 There is a photo of the Hotel Phoenix near the bottom .
__label__1 You 're more likely to get replies to this if you post it in the Europe forum .
__label__0 We did n't come back to London , but they were planning on late afternoon .

__label__0 Welcome to Fodor 's !
__label__0 We 'd also love to do some charity work along the way , environmental or help with building a project or something like that .
__label__0 -LRB- anyway - do you REALLY want to take incendiary\/explosive items on an airplane ? -RRB-
__label__0 Makes ense on these longer trips .

__label__0 huorani.com bellavistacloudforest.com CotoPaxi volcano all
__label__1 The international access code various from country to country -LRB- as Tangata has indicated -RRB- and while you used to have to dial the actual access code for the country that you are ringing from , you can now just dial the + symbol to access it .
__label__0 quote : Originally posted by ZGordon :
__label__0 I could give her cash , but that seems a bit of a copout .
__label__0 I 'm not especially loyal to any particular car company and I do n't envisiage any changes to our trip , so is there any other downfall with renting a car through Hotwire ?
__label__1 Christabel , I usually budget for about cash 50 of whatever the local currency is per day and that has worked for me , apart from Switzerland , where it was very expensive .
__label__0 This board is more for general travel topics .
__label__0 In some cases it is necessary to change a switch to suit the voltage .
__label__1 As your husband is n't doing an Insight tour , do n't be surprised if none of the people here can help you .
__label__1 I would still recommend this hotel however because of the location .
__label__0 Second , I told it `` undiscovered '' and its first suggestion is Acapulco ?
__label__0 Thanks Golfergal , will google Rick Steves travel stores .
__label__0 Thank you for your patience .
__label__0 I would n't dream of smoking near a food area and you 'll probably get told to stop if you do .
__label__0 I will mostly be using wifi anyway , it is just for an emergency .
__label__1 Take separate holidays !
__label__1 And I 've yet to come across a hotel in Europe that did n't have wi-fi .
__label__1 Generally the space is great , but sometimes some seats are a little closer together and often there is a little less legroom at the seat behind the back side door and also the first seat on each side .
__label__0 I am looking for a day pack that is fully packable .
__label__1 The return does depend on traffic and other stops but you can figure between 4 and 6 pm .
__label__0 Can the tours accomodate additional luggage ?
__label__0 You highlight the paragraph , then click bookmark with a `` bologna '' tag , and it goes straight to your bologna file on your diigo account !
__label__0 So at $ 3 a minute for me its pretty cheap and easy
__label__0 I have been in Europe a few times in December , and once in March .
__label__1 If you go to Discovery tours on the corner of your web page and bring up your tour it will have a part for optionals .
__label__0 We are driving to the beach this summer and will be staying in a condo for two weeks .
__label__0 The airport to Rome is about 45 Euro , however on arrival we prebooked a limo from the hotel  
__label__0 Number of Previous Tours :
__label__1 Use the Change Forum option above .
__label__1 Since you are at NYC , let me suggest something really close , not too expensive , and it gets you out of the BIG city and into a small quaint lake front .
__label__0 What end of the terminal were you on .
__label__0 I was wondering if there are reputable travel planning services that you 've used before ?
__label__1 Conversations with people in the vehicle are different than ones with those on the phone .
__label__0 Thank you for the suggestions , ShelliDawn .
__label__1 From New Orleans , take the Crescent all the way to New York with possible stops in Atlanta or Washington .
__label__1 Also click on Destinations at the top of this page .
__label__1 I plug my chargers , blowers , etc. into the cord and the cord into the adaptor giving me greater flexibility .
__label__0 The front are a lot easier -LRB- less steep and much easier to climb  than the back .
__label__1 Click on Optionals and you will find details on the various options that may be offered .
__label__1 If so , check out Go Shuttle -LRB- similar to Supershuttle , which currently does n't serve FLL -RRB- .
__label__0 We ca n't visit too much but would definitely like to see the best sites .
__label__1 Overall , very reasonable and much better than running around trying to find a hotspot near the hotel .
__label__1 No pics inside the tombs in the Valley of the Kings for us though .
__label__0 I 've never heard about this website before , but the deal is very tempting .
__label__0 So where would you take two young boys ?
__label__1 Hello travel , I have never used a Concierge that much and no doubt other Fodorites will have different thoughts but I would be inclined to tip the Concierge a $ 100.00 .
__label__1 A lunch box with freezer packs just would n't work for that situation .
__label__1 I think you can travel before `` rush hour '' but it costs a bit more .
__label__0 I have sooo many questions ... I want her to have a great time .
__label__1 You might want to post your questions over on the Europe board .
__label__0 Kauai or Maui might fit the bill .
__label__0 I was wondering if folks fly into another city and then travel to Austria by local flights or rail ?
__label__0 The book is supposed to be on sale July 26 , not July 21 .
__label__0 OUr travel documents have arrived at the travel agent so we are starting to get very excited
__label__0 I 'm not sure we can help you decide .
__label__0 We are planning to do the Britain and Ireland Discovery 22 day tour in August next year and would like some feedback from someone who has done this previously .
__label__0 Posted 23 May 2008 06:47
__label__1 sassy - you would n't see one whilst traveling by plane , you need to be on the ground to spot them .
__label__0 We are from Georgia , USA .
__label__1 There are hundreds of Paris experts who post there but never look at `` Travel Tips
__label__1 the bits and bobs you might need during the day .
__label__0 All the past premiums and now they have fuzzy math and do n't want to reimburse .
__label__0 Jamaica is a very beautiful place to visit .
__label__1 I would go with Egypt as well .
__label__0 We have used a laptop with success .
__label__0 My question is , which is the cheapest option .
__label__1 They will always give you the option to do in English .
__label__0 Have a great safe time and let us know how it went when safely home .
__label__0 I have written a report on the European Explorer in `` Tour Tales '' and you may find that this will give you an idea of day by day touring .
__label__0 Welcome to Fodors , sunshineny .
__label__0 It is an extremely expensive proposition to fly the bike
__label__1 Sometimes optionals do n't appear until it 's a few weeks or a month before the first departure date .
__label__0 We also stayed at Phoenix and we could not fully open the ensuite door because it touched the bed .
__label__0 I was told by Insight that I do not need my documents .
__label__1 Our main reason for flying British Air is the very comfortable seats in World Traveller Plus .
__label__0 Looking for input for 11 days of traveling in March .
__label__0 I have not done the CR of Switzerland - have done CR of France , Ireland and Italy but I think that you may find that you are limited in what you can do and where you can go .
__label__0 Although we are staying at the Conrad Hotel , we did n't book it through Insight so we do n't qualify for their free airport pickup .
__label__0 Any help from experienced travellers would be much appreciated !
__label__0 They no longer offer the one I have but do have others of similar light weight .
__label__1 Backpacks often fit up there when not filled completely because they can be `` squished '' in .
__label__0 -LRB- I have never been to Rome , but will this year , and like yourself this will be my first solo trip -RRB-
__label__1 Both have excellent accommodation .
__label__1 Poider , if you mean the Travelex Cash Passport card then yes , I have been using it for a number of years and have always found plenty of ATM 's to use it in .
__label__0 But yes , there are still plenty of us smokers around , huddling pathetically round doorways .
__label__0 I took the Northern Capitals
__label__0 I just read a book titled `` Michelangelo and the Pope 's Ceiling '' by Ross King .
__label__0 For us on the west coast , it is better for us to book our air directly .
__label__0 We also traveled during the SARS episode , including a trip to Hong Kong and another to Turkey .
__label__0 I was reading this post on the TT BB and found it very good .
__label__1 Research this and I 'm sure you 'll find it satisfactory .
__label__0 Maggie May , quote : It would have been cheaper for us to skip the transfer and pay the hotel ourselves .
__label__0 Maybe some more people will answer you on this .
__label__1 If not , then you would have also had to use a converter .
__label__0 Can anybody point us in the right direction ?
__label__0 I know I need and adaptor to convert the shape of the power point , but what about converting the current .
__label__0 In any case , your travel agent can usually do better for you on price and routing .
__label__0 Think I might also sign up for Telstra Telecard .
__label__1 If you 're already arriving at JFK , I do n't think it makes any sense to go to Laguardia .
__label__0 I take a backpack , and I 'm a lot older than this pair !
__label__0 I have flown into and out of Heathrow twice in the past two years with my butane curling iron in my checked luggage and encountered no problems with doing so .
__label__0 Thanks very much for your prompt response , look forward to your web teams response
__label__1 There are a lot of exotic travel places in Asia that you would surely enjoy .
__label__0 anyone has an idea ?
__label__0 They are bound to be serviceable since the rental agency does n't want liability if a seat fails , but that does n't mean it will be clean .
__label__0 It did me the whole trip .
__label__1 Moreover , you can pay with PayPal -LRB- thereby dodging Hotwire 's reluctance to accept credit cards from a random selection of countries -RRB- .
__label__0 The phone company `` help '' desks just want to sell me another contract .
__label__0 The food is good .
__label__0 Has anyone ever used an Ipad to connect to the web in Europe ?
__label__0 The photo helped a lot .
__label__0 That way you have 2 carry ons which should be more than enough , two pairs of shoes , a few jeans and shorts , a bunch of shirts , and a little extra room for stuff that you buy .
__label__0 I am open to anywhere in the world really .
__label__0 The bag is able to be squashed in here
__label__0 Has anyone used it for a trip with multiple plane changes , etc ?
__label__0 So whether you will need a car while in Nashville will depend on where you stay .
__label__0 You can try it out .
__label__0 It is incredibly beautiful vut I have the locals there to be VERY rude .
__label__0 In the end , I decided to get her Thai bhat so she has currency on landing and does n't have to worry about ATMs with big-time jet lag !
__label__1 The standard is 001 which is what you get if you use the + sign , but 008 or 009 will also work and are considerably cheaper .
__label__1 I organised for my boss 's luggage to be sent from Australia to USA so she did n't have to carry as much .
__label__0 We needed a minivan and the cheapest I could find all in was $ 450 .
__label__0 Is it still good ?
__label__0 For the last 2 years we have taken holidays in Egypt which has been perfect , but would like to try somewhere different this year .
__label__0 I agree with Hornets ` umbrella
__label__1 Beware also the tour guide often holds up a newspaper so you can follow him , but take a tip from me , get a good look at him and do n't ever lose sight , they nearly all hold up a newspaper !
__label__0 I beleive , ` when in doubt , throw it out '' Going to freeze that half inch of water now , and hope that I do n't forget why it 's there .
__label__0 Last edited by : John - Moderator , 05 July 2007 14:49

__label__1 usually , if the forecast is for a hot day , I 'll wear shorts or 3\/4 length pants
__label__0 We prefer not to drive ourselves now that we are 80 ... bus , train trips would be fine .
__label__0 We wo n't be changing our booking but the more prepared we are the better we can cope with any problems .
__label__1 We had a some very nice optional meals , but we did not have to dress up for them .
__label__0 I will try and write a tale , I did not keep a diary on this tour .
__label__1 Do n't forget to load it before you leave .
__label__0 You 'll be left with all the change .

__label__1 Bring up the web page for your tour and you will find tabs at the top that refers to : intinary , dates and prices , optionals , etc. .
__label__0 How many people ?
__label__0 Offering the security of traveler 's checks along with the convenience of a Visa debit card is what you receive when using the Visa Travel Money card .
__label__0 Agree with Boom Boom -- a nice little trip .
__label__1 We did the European Grandeur in April and left London on a Tuesday , we had a wake up call for 4.15 bags out at 4.45 and at Dover in time to catch the 8.30 am ferry to France .

__label__0 The `` 21 days before departure '' is BS .
__label__0 That was my thought exactly .
__label__0 or somewhere else -RRB- to be the hotel recommendations .
__label__0 I 'm curious since you have been with both .
__label__1 A short taxi ride to anywhere in London , especially the Marble Arch Area .
__label__0 All you do is go to accessmyid.com and they will take the load off your mind in case you come into any trouble re : passports or medical documents being lost , stolen or copied .
__label__1 There is a charge of course .
__label__1 The problem with Linux\/Ubuntu is that not all applications support them as OS .
__label__0 total weight -LRB- which is more like 24 '' -RRB- .
__label__0 All kinds of possibilities .
__label__0 there are many things you can do in Vienna on your own .
__label__0 Teh TD spent a few days going over them .
__label__1 I 'd just be taking disposables or buying one when I was there to be on the safe side .
__label__1 Walk the Corniche .
__label__0 I thought it quite outstanding .
__label__0 Check them out .
__label__1 Also - when you re-post -- include your budget . '
__label__1 As above , post to the Europe board for more attention .
__label__0 Though TSA is n't really clear on that , there are some TSA directives that do allow them , but no additional tanks .
__label__0 that 's great that evernote has access to your documents , as well .
__label__1 OTher people were on waiting lists for some of them .
__label__1 Rings are ok in my opinion , flashy gold necklace that could pulled off from a motorbike I think not a good idea .
__label__1 Keep in mind , that having a cell phone in Europe it could get `` pickpocketed '' just like cameras , wallets and cash .
__label__0 I 've never encountered a shower stall in a cruise ship that was n't smooth enough to hold one of the suction cups .
__label__0 with 13 usually cheapest
__label__0 The big Insight bus can not make it to the Hotel to unload luggage .
__label__0 I have had some friends who have had good success but I have also heard some stories about scams .
__label__1 Some of the reservations were made a year previous and they needed numbers as soon as possible .
__label__0 How about Miami ?
__label__1 Even though the sidewalks and canals are a hodgepodge , if you have a good map and follow the signs , it is easy getting around .
__label__1 On September 1st a website designed to help travellers avoid transport scams at arrival points -LRB- airport , ferry terminals , train stations -RRB- around the world was launched .
__label__0 Also , I purchased a travel clothesline on ebay .
__label__1 Use Skype , although the call quality varies .

__label__1 That website is for the independent traveller , whereas this site is for people doing Insight tours .
__label__0 I was more concerned for my camcorder , phone etc. .
__label__0 You 'll get better answers if you 're more specific .
__label__0 we love camping , biking , kayaking , rock climbing etc. and want to find places along\/near I-80 to make the trip more enjoyable .
__label__0 Also , for those who do not know , the `` AutoGrilles '' are the Hi-Way restaurant chain seen along the AutoStrada throughout most of Italy .
__label__1 All the hotels used are of at least a 4 star rating and if you have any issues with your room at the time , do tell your Tour Director and they will do everything possible to rectify this situation as Insights reputation is on the line and they probably are the hotel chains best customers , so the hotel will very much cater to any needs or problems straight away at the time .
__label__1 I read somewhere on this BB once that balloons work effectively as well .
__label__0 We both have been to Italy , Mexico , Greece , Spain , Caribbean , Costa Rica and looking for a unique travel idea that will offer both sunshine and comfort in late March early April .

__label__0 Hi , I 'm going on Italian Escapade in July and would like to know if men and women are wearing shorts in Italy .
__label__1 See http://wilhelmswords.com/eur2006/index.html - Idling Through the Islands for things to do .
__label__1 I have done three home swaps already , and my last one was in Paris through www.RoofSwap.com .
__label__1 Insight used to provide branded carry-on bags that were approx .
__label__0 On a previous trip I used airline points because it was a guaranteed departure date .
__label__0 - not Grenada or Jamaica or Cancun -LRB- I 've already been there -RRB-
__label__0 Almost got caught out in Istanbul paying for lunch on the first day - not quite enough local currency to meet the bill - but they quickly worked out what I owed in US .
__label__0 He 's helped put together some very special and detailed trips for us .
__label__0 There will be children but there need not be a lot child specific activities everyday , so amusement parks are n't a necessity
__label__0 -LRB- Who has one like Lenin etc ?

__label__1 I think the timing all depends on if you 're landing at a popular time , how many people are waiting for the transfer at the same time , and if you arrive on a weekday or weekend in regards to traffic .
__label__0 We used both credit card and ATMs in Turkey with no problems using just commonsense on where and when to use either .
__label__0 this is the flatiron district , yes ?

__label__0 It 's a kind of insurance I like to have .

__label__0 It probably does n't help that none of these areas are on my `` want to visit '' list , except I have been thinking about Dominica -LRB- NOT Dominican Republic -RRB- , which it did n't suggest .
__label__1 If you will be at the Thistle Marble Arch , ask the concierge to direct you `` across the street '' to The Three Tuns -- for LUNCH .
__label__0 Likewise if you go to a park and sit on a bench , it 's impolite to sit next to a non-smoker and spark up .

__label__0 Only cheap thing in Russia was Vodka .
__label__0 I am going to europe in March for 17 days and plan to take my ereader .

__label__0 There is an elevated walkway over the busy street .
__label__0 You get both a passport and a travel card together so you have a back-up document in case you lose the passport .

__label__0 Sorry but I just ca n't imagine that shipping a bag would be anything less than an expensive headache .
__label__1 There are lots of optionals and the free time in between seemed to be taken up with deciding on souvenirs , food or spending lots of time taking photos or enjoying the different surroundings .

__label__1 I would highly recommend buying it before your trip !
__label__0 In 2002 I stayed at the Keppler , which was very reasonable and in walking distance to all the main attractions .

__label__0 Thank you , this is very reassuring
__label__0 Thank you for bringing this to our attention .
__label__1 With the Travelex C\/P card , you lock in the exchange rate when the money is loaded on to the card - so both have advantages or possibly disadvantages .

__label__0 There is a slight possibility I might have forgotten though I do n't think so

__label__0 I took the ferry from Piraeus .

__label__0 And I saw the same gadget - different brand - at the central terminal at SeaTac in the Ex Officio store , again ~ $ 20 .
__label__1 You will get more answers if you repost on the Europe board - see Change Forum above .

__label__0 I 've had some really horrible CS experience in the States and some wonderful ones in the UK - and vice versa .
__label__0 We 're leaving in a month for our super long trip that we really have no idea how long it will be .

__label__0 Another family with kids that waited with us , finally decided to quit and left after half an hour .
__label__0 It was the best hotel I ever stayed at .
__label__1 I would definitely take a pair of long pants and a light jacket and perhaps a warm sweater or fleece .
__label__1 Alternatively try as much as possible to stay together as a group .
__label__0 If so , what companies do you recommend ?
__label__0 I was thinking perhaps September or March\/April .
__label__1 London Heathrow is not perfect , but they are better than in the past , especially with BA 's new terminal -LRB- s -RRB- .
__label__1 Write the price down on a piece of paper .
__label__1 Just speak up at the time .
__label__0 I know the Canadian dollar is higher than the US now and some of us had hoped for breaks as a result but the euro keeps going up as well and you 're heading to Europe ?
__label__0 The train backs into the New Orleans station which is next to the Super Dome .
__label__0 Sorry , no experience with that one .
__label__0 -LRB- We will have credit cards for purchases , too . -RRB-
__label__0 What about a bed

__label__0 also , should we take into consideration the July heat and stick to northern\/cooler regions ?
__label__0 Also I would like a fall back place to meet in the correct terminal in case we do n't connect right away .
__label__0 My friend and I are planning to visit those three countries as they are so close to one another .

__label__0 This is pretty standard .
__label__0 The final decision on coach tour group will depend on how much space we have between seats .
__label__1 Dollywood is in a small town not served directly by an airport or the bus as far as I know, so driving the 3.5 hours would get you there as opposed to flying into Knoxville and having to drive from there .
__label__0 I think hubby will have to set the recorder .
__label__0 The members of this BB will be also happy to help with your question so all you have to do is ask .
__label__0 His wife had wanted to do the tour and he did n't want to let her miss it so suffered for her .
__label__0 The printed list is all the `` possible '' optionals , but only a selection of them will be offered on any given tour .

__label__0 Thanks all for taking time to respond .
__label__1 Find a great a place for lunch and enjoy the view .
__label__0 We did most of the optionals and were pleased that we did .
__label__0 That is a tricky one as it rather depends on your ` meds ' and where you are going .
__label__1 After a long flight , the last thing you want to do is find a cab and pay an exorbitant fee .
__label__1 Next time remember one thing : Row 9 is not in the cheap seats .
__label__0 The flights were identical to what Insights have to offer so connections and arrival airport pickups were no problem .
__label__1 You can buy chargers at Walmart , Radio Shack , etc. , just make sure they are dual voltage .
__label__0 Why not travel with Trafalgar , Insight 's sister company ?
__label__1 If you want it for travel only then go for something smaller than a 17 '' - it will save weight and be easier to carry .
__label__0 Have fun planning your trip to beautiful Italy !
__label__0 I think this is one of those super ignorant questions for this group but I 've never had occasion to call from home to anyplace outside the US .
__label__0 Emergency Contact Relation :

__label__1 You want to post this over on the Caribbean forum for more people to see who might know about Aruba .

__label__1 Call them and ask what model car seat is used by them , and what they promise in terms of quality .
__label__0 Any feedback on what you found would be helpful .
__label__0 My only concern is that they wo n't work simply because they are n't full fledged debit cards , just simple ATM-only cards .
__label__0 It 's not a matter of the length of the trip IMO .
__label__0 We are looking into a slow paced -LRB- I will have my 80 year old mother-in-law -RRB- trip that includes Normandy and Paris .

__label__0 They will be traveling by train and bus a lot .
__label__0 I enjoyed every trip , but sometimes the weather does n't cooperate .
__label__1 You may take a while to get through the formalities , so the time you have there probably wo n't be enough to leave the airport to see anything .
__label__0 I 've even been on tours where people even claim there hand luggage is too heavy to carry .
__label__0 Travelling makes me happy !

__label__0 We do buy a travel medical plan because our primary medical does n't cover us out of the country .
__label__0 We love anything a bit mad , skydiving , kitesurding , scuba diving , etc , drinking , partying , chilling , happy to slum it .
__label__0 Then again it was hard enough to pack for two weeks and it was n't really a necessity !
__label__0 We are off to Europe in 21 days so are getting excited about it all now .
__label__0 - in travel terms that 's not a day pack , it 's a backpack !
__label__0 Congratulations , and welcome to Fodors .
__label__1 I still prefer Capital One because it does n't add on an extra foreign exchange fee .
__label__0 , I find that when it gets around 25 i start to feel it , but my wife feels the cold as soon as it gets under 20
__label__0 thanks for that reply
__label__0 If we had days at leisure and the driver had nothing to do with my on those days because I did n't take any of the optionals , I consider that when calculating my tip .
__label__0 Also , carefully follow the directions and requirements for claims submission and make sure you have the correct documentation .
__label__1 If you do n't need anything from the bag during the day , you can take it and put it under the bus before you board and then retrieve it when you arrive at the hotel and carry it to your room yourself .
__label__0 Where are you staying otherwise ?
__label__0 We only need the car seat for the first half of the trip , then we will be lugging it around on public transportation .
__label__1 I wore capris below the knee , tops with sleeves and never needed to cover my head .

__label__0 Enjoy your cruise ,
__label__0 Wonder if anyone has opinions about the optionals for this tour .
__label__0 Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated .
__label__0 I would take a couple of pairs of long panse as the weather in August could be a little cooler but saying that 3\/4 's are also fine .
__label__0 There have been times when I 've been out of center but that does n't bother me at all .
__label__1 We returned on a Sunday and were due back in London about 4.00 pm but did n't arrive unitl 5.30 due to an accident which closed the road for a while .
__label__0 John is at least 6 ' 4 '' at he has BAGS of legroom !
__label__0 The straps can be zipped in for easy transport when they do n't want it on their back or if they decide to check it on the way home .
__label__0 They do n't sell all those fleece jackets with `` San Francisco '' written on them down at Fisherman 's Wharf for nothin ' !
__label__0 I 'm also comparing the two tours .
__label__0 Ok , I have panic attacks in tunnels .
__label__0 I would hope the same is true of my postings .
__label__0 Therefore , can someone please advise on if we should stay in the West Coast the first night or drive directly over to the East Side and how many nights do you recommend in each city ?
__label__1 Looking back on some of our photos , my husband did not wear shorts in any of the countries we visited when we were going to visit churches\/temples\/mosques of any denomination-Everyone is different -- that is us -- wear what you feel is right for you and enjoy your trip .
__label__0 As a fellow Kiwi I can really recommend touring with Insight .
__label__0 I was wondering if someone could tell me what time we leave London on the Tuesday and What time we arrive back on the Sunday ?

__label__1 Also if you decide not to take one of the optionals you may have time , but again , there is a lot to see around the amazing cities and that may be more important to you .
__label__1 I 've never tried it , but they would n't take up much room or weight in a suitcase .
__label__0 So we go the entire route from Arizona and then some !
__label__0 Or at least I think that 's how it works .
__label__1 I put $ 50.00 on it last year .
__label__0 Then I am going out of town -LRB- not out of country -RRB- .

__label__0 Has anyone had any experience with this luggage ?
__label__1 You 'll want to check out the various destination forums like Europe , Asia , Mexico , US , etc. .

__label__0 I have raised this with our web team and will get back to you asap with some answers .
__label__0 Thought we needed a new discussion !

__label__1 In fact I usually have a cabin bag , a handbag or camera bag and a walking stick .
__label__0 I met different people and witnessed different culture and tasted different type of cuisine .
__label__1 Travelling in cold regions like Switzerland , we will place a coat or sweater on the overhead rack .

__label__0 A couple of people have told me that I need to bring a dress\/skirt to wear -- that it may be required in some churches .
__label__1 We enjoyed sandals for the leisure days on the cruise to wear while lounging on the top deck .
__label__0 One thought that sparked up is , would passionate travellers such as yourselves be interested in an alternative stream of income - travellers would post where they 're traveling\/what planning they require and how much they 're willing to pay .
__label__0 yeah , that 's probably the best way to stay happily married !
__label__1 Its easy to find top up ice at any airport or the airlines will give you more inflight .
__label__0 During the evening I wore black slacks with a few dresser tops nothing fancy .
__label__0 Hi , I am trying to work out whether to buy a `` SIMple Calling Plus '' sim card , as advertised here on the Insight website , or to buy a local sim card when we arrive in the USA .
__label__1 You do n't need to worry though as all ages and fitness levels travel on Insight Tours .
__label__0 I also had a few pairs of long pants and one or two long sleeved shirts .
__label__1 We enjoyed it very much and the tour guides in each of the cities were lovely and extremely knowledgeable about their cities and Russian history and culture .

__label__0 I have never used Priceline and need a room close to the airport for an early morning flight .
__label__0 If they are the same litreage as the allowable size does this matter ?
__label__0 I prefer Swiss 's inflight first class , but Lufthansa 's F ground services are probably the best of any airline , anywhere .
__label__1 In Europe , what you call a `` wash cloth '' is regarded as a `` personal item '' which the guest brings with them , like a toothbrush .
__label__1 I 'd also consider Prague , Brno and Budapest as possible alternatives because it 's very easy to get to Vienna from there .
__label__0 Are these okay or should he stick with full length pants ?
__label__0 Are you saying that she will be entering the US for the first time ?
__label__0 Pickpockets are often a topic on the BB .

__label__1 There is usually a big line up for the ferry so they like to leave VERY early .

__label__1 Sant ` Elena itself is a residential and rather green area on the `` fish tail '' of Venice .

__label__0 I have never had a problem .
__label__1 They are amazing with info about getting the most out of FF programs , mileage runs , one bagging , etc.
__label__0 Thank you so much for recommending this tour tale .
__label__0 I would like some feedback if possible .
__label__0 Your personal views\/story make no difference to that , all they are going to do is keeping telling you what the policy is , rather than get into debating it with you .
__label__0 - not too far from US given length of travel -LRB- i.e. Central\/South America , Carribbean , Pacific Islands -RRB-

__label__0 Could you please tell me if we are being reasonable ?
__label__1 George V is the absolute best hotel i have ever stayed in .
__label__0 I realize souvenirs may be a few $ s or thousands so do n't try to include too much there but what about non-included meals , drinks etc. .

__label__0 A long discussion begins with them saying that according to the contract a name change is chargeable and me making a point that according to the same contract the ` lead party ' , which is the ` Contact ' , is responsible for the payment and therefore has to be the cardholder , besides everything esle .
__label__1 Load your debit card OR raise your credit balance and think twice , then buy once !
__label__0 I usually print off a couple of label sheets , with the addresses of the family
__label__0 Is it just real low crime and people basically need to leave it on blankets ?

__label__1 Normally , the hotel receptionist will have a list of names of tour members and that is all that is required for you to check in .
__label__0 I wish I had brought a wrinkle free lightweight dress or two for the evening dinners .
__label__0 People dont really dress up 4 dinner .
__label__0 Kay - We too have been waiting for the 2008 Optionals list to come out to help us with our budgeting .
__label__0 Hardly anyone reads this `` Travel Tips '' branch , unfortunately .
__label__0 This will be the first organized tour that my wife and I have ever gone on .
__label__0 Oops , I see this is an old post that got topped .
__label__0 I assume she has a checking account that has an ATM card that she 's planning to use for cash while she 's there .
__label__0 Are you prepared to go without home comforts ?
__label__0 I love the technology but want to streamline as much as possible .
__label__0 my Office does n't have One Note .
__label__0 Everything worked out with the hiking backpacks ... they 're young , they can handle anything .
__label__1  In Europe you can do without the transformer -LRB- that 's the extra equipment -RRB- if you can switch to 240 v -LRB- volts . -RRB-
__label__1 The program offerings are relatively limited , but they do have a summer school option .
__label__0 I did the Country Roads of Italy and Sicily , but used my cane .
__label__1 At Heathrow the checks take so long , as you almost have to strip off and the staff are rather slow in my opinion -LRB- nor are they happy folk either ! -RRB-
__label__1 It looks like a giant handywipe with a hole for your head .
__label__0 Lenore , I have not done the tour you are doing , but I have done a lot of tours with Insight .
__label__1 So it was closer to 6 oclock .
__label__0 I know we used expedia in the past , and I live in North Carolina -LRB- Raleigh Durham area -RRB-
__label__0 Otherwise , Istanbul sounds like just what you 're looking for .
__label__0 Indian or Pacific Ocean locations preferred .
__label__0 USAir is probably my ` home ' airline as well , since I live in Phoenix and , now that I see your mention of Starwood that reminds me I 've seen that brand mentioned on these boards before .
__label__0 I have n't mastered the art of traveling light either but I can pass on the advice of others on this forum ... the secret is to ` layer ' .
__label__0 But this is just me , I always confirm everything
__label__0 ASSUMING you do NOT mean the optionals offered by the tour guide - such as dinners and special events - which could go to 200 pounds -- ASSUMING that you just mean everyday expenses , that 's still hard !
__label__0 Some hotels offer their own transportation .
__label__0 The directions are with it .
__label__1 Yes , book as early as you can for discounted fares
__label__0 I also booked mine independently from Insight using my travel agent and saved quite a bit .
__label__1 Definitely read and post over on the Caribbean , US , and maybe Mexico forums .
__label__0 We had to cancel for medical\/surgical reasons this month and the cost of the trip for both was over $ 15,000 .
__label__0 My wife and I have no kids for the week after Easter and are looking for some place to go ... 4,5,6 or 7 days .
__label__1 Never go barefoot on the carpets or floors oooh .
__label__0 It will be our first trip away together and will be celebrating 4 years together .
__label__0 I am not see your files here .
__label__0 I also heard that I may need to cover my head and to bring a scarf .
__label__0 Does anyone have any view about the fitness level that someone would need to enjoy this tour .
__label__0 We will take both to be sure .
__label__1 If it 's for a warm day , I 'll wear jeans\/pants
__label__0 This is such an incredibly handy tool to have with me on international trips as it eliminates the need for a converter - which run too hot anyway and fry my hair .
__label__1 It 's less than an hour drive .
__label__0 Auusie travellers to the above countries .

__label__0 This is the same procedure we have experienced on other tours with Insight in the past .
__label__0 Microsoft 's One Note does a nice job with organizing travel plans - it comes in a variety of Office packages -LRB- but not all -RRB- .
__label__1 it was good to put all the organisational stuff behind us and sit back and enjoy the ride .
__label__0 Not all hotels have WiFi though .
__label__1 You should do a search first on the Europe board because there surely are other discussions on the same topic .
__label__0 Even though I had a free room for two nights they upgraded me to a river front balcony room .
__label__1 I took the following amount in cash -LRB- for me traveling alone -RRB- as well as having my VISA charge card and bank card for ATM withdrawals -LRB- both of which did not use -RRB- with me :
__label__0 Scaffolding completly covered the whole front of the hotel and there were a lot of wires still hanging loose throughout the hotel especially in the hallways as if the lighting were all being changed .
__label__0 I finally got a ride from them only after an hour and then waiting for another 20 minutes while they picked someone else up at another terminal .

__label__0 I was there 2 years ago but that is not pertinent to your question .
__label__0 For some reason my eyes do n't see things on vertical surfaces when I scan the room to see if I 've forgotten anything .
__label__0 So by doing that it will give you a pretty good idea .
__label__0 There is a website for online access to your documents , and a desktop program for more features and functionality .
__label__0 LeSportsSac has very lightweight nylon ones in that style .
__label__0 Normally they just wear Casaul wear clothing like during day time .
__label__1 but as bratsandbeer advises -- be sure you know who you are dealing w \/ and are confident everything is legit .
__label__0 What are you experiences with using OnStar as a phone ?
__label__0 I just came back from Paris two days ago and had used Super Shuttle .
__label__0 I think I bought it at a dollar store .
__label__0 Is that the best place to get one ?
__label__0 I am not concerned either .
__label__1 The overhead space is fine for storing a jacket or coat , an umbrella , items you may purchase during the day but not much else .
__label__0 Some hotels we had to go to the lobby , and some had access in the rooms .
__label__0 Does anyone have the answer to this question ?
__label__0 Please suggest for making this vacation memorable .

__label__1 We have taken Delta , non-stop Venice to Atlanta and have had reasonable Venice departure times -LRB- 10:00 or 11:00 am -RRB- so the previous is not universally true .
__label__0 I have not been able to find a local agency experienced with this specific kind of situation .
__label__1 I sort of like the Starwood program a bit more , because they allow you to use points plus a little cash for redemption stays .
__label__0 On a recent business trip to our office in Shenzhen -LRB- from London -RRB- , I took a week hols in Thailand on the way to break up the journey .
__label__0 Could someone who has taken this tour give us some insite

__label__0 Well , at least he 's stopping off in patisseries and restaurants for `` se restaurer '' .
__label__1 If your only going to make a few calls it might be worth contracting your carrier and asking about the cost to make calls .
__label__1 Definitely take a tour inside the Hassan II mosque .
__label__1 Others in the vehicle are aware of the driving conditions and will naturally stop conversation as needed so that the driver can give full attention to the road .
__label__0 Thankyou so much John .
__label__1 If you want to enter the proper Casino part , then you must present your passport , pay the number of Euros -LRB- sorry ca n't remember the amount and men must wear a tie and jacket .

__label__0 Sorry , ca n't remember the ferry crossing times .
__label__0 I have some questions concerning the vouchers .

__label__0 We would like to do some snorkeling , adventures , and visiting out side of a resort .
__label__0 I know this is last minute but my travel agent has not been able to arrange anything for me for my transfer from the Nice Hotel to the airport .
__label__0 Enjoy
__label__0 there are many vacation rental companies available online for booking your vacation rental But few of them are fake ones

__label__0 Bike is unassembled .
__label__1 I have been to the catacombs and it an excellent experience , not if you a frightened of small spaces though .
__label__0 I am greatly influenced by the tips you provided .
__label__0 I 'm sure the machine would charge a transaction fee .
__label__0 There was a woman on my Grand Tour of Italy and Sicily a few years ago who screamed the whole time we did the Amalfi Coast drive .
__label__0 This was a feel-good adventure without ever leaving home for this guy .
__label__0 I 'm sorry to hear about the cancellation !
__label__1 Oh and inside the Abu Simbel temples !
__label__0 favs based on your taste snorkel style and budget .
__label__1 Instead of a plastic grocery bag , you could hang one or more of those on a suction cup hook .
__label__0 I have a free day before the tour starts and wish to use a taxi ... do you have to hail the taxi or do you have to book one ?
__label__0 It all depends on the weather patterns at the time of your visit .
__label__0 Here 's my daughter 's report on the experience .

__label__0 Looking for suggestions for a one week break in August .
__label__0 Does anyone have any advice on which optionals to take on Irish Elegance .
__label__0 Back to the top for someone else to answer .
__label__0 We all live in the NY area and will be departing directly from NYC .
__label__0 I would love to go back to Italy but we are trying to see something new .
__label__0 It has a neck cord .
__label__0 Which TD did you have in Egypt by the way ?
__label__0 Some people had them on our tour , because they had not received their tickets and tour info , till it was almost time for departure .
__label__0 But I will look at it .
__label__0 I think this tunnel was between Florence and Lucerne , it was a couple of years ago now since I experienced this .
__label__0 It 's small and simple , but has beds and bathrooms which is all you need .
__label__1 Between Thanksgiving and Christmas the White River Gardens next to the zoo has an electric train exhibit which is very interesting .
__label__1 Even if you 're going to be there a few days , it does save some money and you can use it on the Tube and iconic Double Decker Buses .
__label__0 August 10 Britain
__label__0 Are all guests met at the airport with a sign with their name on it ?
__label__1 Just look around , click on stuff and you will find it leads to a pleathera of other stuff
__label__0 We always check our luggage .
__label__0 Our bank credits back all ATM charges from other banks .
__label__0 Overall , I think the system is a good one , but every barrel has its bad apples .
__label__0 Some people in our group on the tour used cabs and we heard good things and bad things about the rates .
__label__1 If you want a budget-friendly family trip , home swapping would be your best bet .
__label__0 I booked a Croatian cruise and the agency wants me to send a deposit by bank transfer .
__label__0 Thanks , Cristina !
__label__0 1 -RRB- if most beaches need to be driven to 2 -RRB- I wouldnt drive without license , hotel keys , etc 3 -RRB- AND I 'm the only adult and planning on being in the water ; what do people do with their wallets\/purses while snorkeling , etc on the sunny beaches ?
__label__0 I 've heard of ABC Store as well but have never been there .
__label__0 But I do n't find it that bad .
__label__1 You can use Google and find some sites to get information and rates .
__label__1 You would have to change trains in Lucca and the trip takes about three hours .
__label__0 my wife is handicapped .
__label__0 We were on this tour last July and LOVED it .
__label__0 Its free and the quality is brilliant .
__label__1 Here are some other websites that may assist you :
__label__1 But I agree with everyone else : Unless there 's absolutely no alternative , never ever withdraw cash as an advance on your credit card .
__label__0 You are expected to show some manners and consideration .
__label__0 However , I try to transfer it when no one is looking .
__label__0 I will advise as soon as they are there .
__label__0 Everybody in the family travels well and we avoid resorts and tours .
__label__1 What about a honeymoon in California ?
__label__0 Can anyone tell me please before I start the process if they ask for the transfer details to and from the airports please .
__label__1 I forgot to take mine and was very sorry I did as my hubby and friends enjoyed their swims immensely .
__label__0 I 'd hate to miss the train especially if you are leaving that night on the ferry .
__label__1 Insight should charge only what the current hotel rate is when the room is booked not at a premium rate and also the transfer cost is included in your tour price in London anyways , whether you come a day early or not .
__label__1 You will not regret your decision if you do book this tour .
__label__0 Highlights of Europe in June .
__label__0 I 'm looking to take a 7-10 day trip during Xmas\/New Years .
__label__1 The only night that was cool was the Sound and Light show at the pyramids and blankets can be hired for 5 LE ... and as this show is an option I would n't bother with it unless you do not have another included light show .
__label__1 There are also programs in Jordan , Lebanon and Palestine that are excellent if the interest is in fusha with Levantine dialect .
__label__0 That depends on the school district and there are a lot of them .
__label__0 If you wanted to see Memphis for 24 hours this is possible .
__label__0 But I saved so much money that it was worth it .
__label__0 i have to check out if diigo has that ...
__label__1 Just give her cash\/a check to deposit into that account .
__label__1 I believe you can register at sites like expedia and travelocity to be notified when a particular route goes down in price .
__label__0 We have previously traveled with Insight and from being absolutely wrapped in 1998 when we did a tour of Europe , where everything was just fantastic to being disappointed in 2004 during back to back tours of Greece and UK .
__label__0 I thought it was kind of cute and ambitious .
__label__0 Thanks for your patience in the meantime .
__label__0 I am taking a tour , ` Britain and Ireland Discovery ' in August then will be spending a further 3 weeks in Britain sightseeing and attending a family wedding .
__label__0 Well , at least I think she does but she has moved in the meantime and to be honest I 'm not entirely sure if she 's kept it or for that matter I 'm not sure exactly what I left with her !
__label__1 If you are a swimmer and would like to get up earlier or have a swim later then bring a swimsuit .
__label__0 We spent the extra time at the end of the tour .
__label__0 It is not as difficult to meet someone there as you might imagine .
__label__0 #NAME?
__label__0 Not us Wren .
__label__0 First off , may you enjoy your tour as much as I did .
__label__0 I booked an appointment with a Vatican guide and also visited the museum with the Insight guide .
__label__0 It is written and drawn for that age group and really shows the kids what is in the city and why you should visit it in their own language .
__label__0 You only have to deal with the bag between the car and the counter , and from the carousel to your destination .
__label__0 I try to check as many sites , which I found consistent , as possible .
__label__1 You are in the best of hands thats why we keep going back with insight .
__label__0 Guanguiltagua.com DiveMasterDennis GREAT Galapagos Cruises
__label__0 Thanks so much for the replies .
__label__0 A big thank you to everyone re : this question .
__label__0 Generally the school vacations start about the first week in June and end about the last week in August .
__label__0 As stated on this forum before , I had an attempt on my ` Packsafe '' handbag in Paris last year .
__label__0 I dislike using a backpack as a daypack simply because they do n't feel safe and they also encourage me to carry a ton of stuff .
__label__0 Then at some point she started writing something on the board including his name , and asked him if that was how he spelled his name .
__label__0 I did it for Hawaii this past April .

__label__1 Fraser Island is situated just off the south Queensland coast opposite Hervey Bay .
__label__0 I 've been to Giverny and Versailles so I 'll skip them .
__label__0 Some hotels charge rewards members a modest amount Marriott was $ 50 for 17 days  just for parking .
__label__1 I found the instructions to be reasonably easy to follow and Insight includes an itinerary which you need to attach to your application .
__label__1 So if any of you are doing an extended tour to Jordan make sure you research it before signing up for it .
__label__1 Here at home or on a tour .
__label__0 Volcanoes beaches diving great safe food culture history
__label__0 There is a great book -LRB- series -RRB- out that I used for my kids when they were younger called `` KIDDING AROUND PARIS '' .
__label__0 You will have a wonderful time .
__label__1 In any case , you 'd get more replies if you posted on the US board  assuming you are talking about a US airport.
__label__1 A friend went to a Sandals resort and loved it .
__label__0 I 'm thinking to save a little money and just get him a travelcard , since I 'm thinking it 's much more likely that he 'll be going to Canada and\/or on a cruise than somewhere that requires an actual passport and we 're not completely sure he 's going anywhere !
__label__0 My wife and I are considering a land tour of the Southwest National Parks -LRB- Grand Canyon ; Lake Powell NRA , etc , . -RRB-
__label__0 thanks pauline , just out of curiosity , how do you usually handle the temperature ?
__label__1 Do n't worry .
__label__0 Hi , we went on this tour in the middle of April a few years ago , we had good weather the whole time from low 20s to high 20s in Morocco .
__label__1 Worth it but not at the expence of the Forum and many other of Rome 's jewels in my opinion .
__label__0 We 'll probably be doing a lot of country road driving .
__label__0 Part of M-22 runs through Sleeping Bear Dunes which was voted as `` America 's Most Beautiful Place '' on Good Morning America ... this is a very cool and scenic area .
__label__0 We have hired cars on the outskirts of London without problems and at the end of the hire they have always been prepared to deliver us to an address in London .
__label__0 Has anyone used the ekit phone you can get through insight and how expensive was it ?
__label__0 They have multi-country SIM cards that work everywhere .
__label__0 Mind you , on some days when I was in t-shirt
__label__1 I remember walking around the old town area , having my lunch which as a wiener on a bun purchased at a take-out window and sitting in the square to eat it .
__label__0 It was stressful enough as it was !
__label__0 sounds good , I 'll give it a try I guess .
__label__0 We are doing the Country Roads of Switzerland Sept. 19th .
__label__1 It was a Saturday so again no traffic , maybe 1\/2 hr ride , and luckily our room was available .
__label__1 The weather was rather cool in Scotland to say the least .
__label__0 they were refunded the amount .
__label__1 If you want advice on where to stay , google .
__label__0 The entire trip will cost about $ 5,000 .
__label__1 If you can fly out of JFK , why would you bother with trekking over to LGA ?
__label__1 Pre-book Prague to Vienna at www.cd.cz/eshop and Prague to Vienna starts at 19 .
__label__1 Otherwise you will need to be up really really early , the queue 's are massive .
__label__0 I 've consulted the travel agent , those two trip resorts provide comfortable hotels with excellent service .
__label__1 Hello Sher , if you repost this on the Europe Forum you will get many more responses .
__label__0 For instance , you 're reading an article\/thread on Bologna .
__label__1 Always lunch -- maybe 6-11 pounds per person if you do n't eat a big meal ; then whatever you choose to spend on souvenirs and that can be trinkets to a piece of tartan wool at the Edinburgh Woolen Mill OR Waterford Crystal .

__label__0 Pleasant temperatures all week long .
__label__1 There 's alot of information out there !

__label__1 Hi Judy : We have been to Italy twice and never needed a skirt or dress .
__label__0 Almost no one will see your thread here .
__label__0 Why was that ?
__label__0 I could get some training in between now and then -LRB- 6 months to go -RRB- .
__label__0 I think we will just book it through Insight , at our Travel Agent 's advice .
__label__1 Now if you need fridge temps for you medication , it gets difficult , however I have found a thermos product called `` Work food and bottle '' that has a wide opening allowing it to be filled with either a frozen gel pack or ice .
__label__1 Once you open the tour link you will see the Optionals tab .
__label__0 Even at 4.5 pounds empty -LRB- which is fabulously lightweight btw -RRB- a 26 '' suitcase would be too heavy for me if it was packed anywhere near full .
__label__0 April usually nice .
__label__0 Its only 2 stops by train from the hotel .
__label__1 I know many tourists only where costume jewellery in europe , but I think the camera or wallet in the hip pocket will get much more attention !
__label__0 Have you found it to be any different .
__label__0 To me , SnappyGo looks like a nice in-between a full-service travel agent and doing it yourself .
__label__1 Anything you read prior to your trip is subject to change .
__label__0 To Phil , Bernhard
__label__0 I will be leaving out of NYC area .
__label__1 But a London Pass is actually a pass you buy to get you into attractions which you can buy a travelcard with as an extra .

__label__0 You 'll get the most heat in Morocco but even that was around the mid to high 20 's .
__label__0 Mine were British Airways for the Europe flight to London Heathrow then Qantas .
__label__0 blaine90b , No advertising allowed on these forums .
__label__0 I can only say we have n't encountered any creepy crawlies of any sort .
__label__0 I know this is n't Insight related but I hope the gang could help me .
__label__0 Really , what you are saying in that situation IS irrelevant , sorry .
__label__0 We do not want to have to ask relatives for a ride if we do not have to .
__label__1 There are quite a few all inclusives in Mexico .
__label__1 There is a hotel with a water park inside located at the northwest corner of I-465 on Michigan Road -LRB- Caribbean Cove is the hotel name -RRB- .
__label__0 Any general recommendations for what works and what does n't ?

__label__0 All the other passengers are easy to get along with .
__label__0 Aside from some mobility issues , he is quite independent .
__label__0 Rented a wonderful apt in Lisbon through VRBO and another beautiful place in Crete through AirBnB .
__label__0 Of course if you guys have cell phones that is easy to stay in touch once their plane has landed .
__label__1 You would do much , MUCH better if you re-post over on the United States forum , tagged Hawaii .
__label__0 I 've not read a tour tale since Tangatta 's and it was n't all that complementary .
__label__1 Just remember we are not there to see what people are wearing each day but the wonderful things we go to Britain
__label__0 How far are you willing to go ?
__label__0 jpg -LRB- 288 KB , 8 downloads -RRB- Map
__label__0 Depending upon the airport , there are a ton of alternative parking options .
__label__1 You 'll probably pay less booking ahead , so do that if you 're sure of your dates , but not through Rail Europe .
__label__0 Then click GO .
__label__1 I typically use Orbitz or Travelocity to see what 's available in the neighborhood .
__label__0 So it really comes down to personal choice .
__label__0 Hi SydneyTeam , We are going on The Bohemian June 6-16 , 2008 .
__label__0 How Times have Changed !
__label__0 I live on an island with limited shopping and very limited selection for light clothing .
__label__1 In fact , it 's all here .
__label__0 or is there some weird travel idea of waterproof purse that fits onto swim suits ... do tell ... I ca n't help wondering ...
__label__0 I 'd maybe re-post over on the Cruise Forum .
__label__1 Keep it in Your Pants .
__label__0 If it was me , I 'd just give her cash or give her a check to deposit into her own account so that she can then get cash from an ATM in Thailand .
__label__0 Thanks , everyone !

__label__0 I am hoping Giverny is offered since I 've never been and I 'm a big Monet fan .
__label__1 Also , on that same site , if you look through people 's travel reports on the Forums , there are a few tips and suggestions there as well .
__label__1 While Insight will only `` porter '' one bag for you , they are very good about storing a second one under the bus - space permitting .
__label__0 Love Vienna - you 'll enjoy it .
__label__0 On my battery chargers for my cameras , it 's on the charger .
__label__0 Am planning on the Oberammergau option but must admit I spend too much time in front of a computer and not enough time getting exercise .
__label__0 Has anyone taken a bus from Granad to Valencia .
__label__1 I 'm pretty sure that the Egyptians like to change their minds all the time , so you might be lucky to get away with no charges - or unlucky and be charged everywhere -LRB- unlikely -RRB-
__label__0 No beaches do n't have lockers .
__label__0 Hope to welcome you on one of our tours in the near future !
__label__1 All you need is the cheap , very light weight adapter for the actual plug so that you can , essentially , put a square plug into a round socket -LRB- or vice versa -RRB- .
__label__1 The hotel may charge the same rate `` per room '' .
__label__0 I have just been reading the Travel tips for Australians and in particular about `` Secure Sentinel '' for protecting credit\/debit cards etc. and other travel documents whilst away .
__label__1 we did the european Heritage last September so was in UK about the same time as our proposed trip and it was mostly warm to hot even on some days .
__label__0 I will fill you in when we get back , although you may have booked by then .
__label__0 Where do u find the itinerary on this website , have looked just about everywhere and i can not locate it .
__label__0 No long lines at all .
__label__0 Due to hurricane season I think I 've decided on Aruba , but I 'm wondering if this is a crazy choice due to the climate at that time .
__label__0 Are you taking along a bike , kayak and camping gear ?
__label__0 I could answer it but I 'm a pilot .
__label__0 Carlisle , near Harrisburg .
__label__0 TripAdvisor is the worst site for restaurant recommendations .
__label__1 You just use it to withdraw money as it 's a debit card and as it is Pin No driven , no personal details are on it .
__label__0 Realising `` C '' could not be a window seat , I took it back and had it changed .
__label__0 I would never have used that FIND if you had not just mentioned it .
__label__1 A good way to save money is to get show tickets from the discount booths that are located in several locations along the strip ... you can do more shows this way - your girlfriend will love that .
__label__0 Israel I am sure shorts would be ok .
__label__0 Evidently they have a parking shortage and request that you obtain a ride .
__label__0 thanks for your advice funster .
__label__1 There is a wealth of information on this board .
__label__0 I am sorry it has taken longer than expected to get this information .
__label__0 When I 'm tipping , I count up the number of days that I had something to do with the TD and bus driver .
__label__0 Okay Suze , I will try and post my travel experiences
__label__0 MaurJoy , Di has given you good advice and I just want to iterate the advice about printing off address labels for putting on the postcards .
__label__1 We place these on the floor of the coach under the seat in front and my wife uses them as an additional footrest .
__label__1 However as previous posters metnioned , I always call to confirm with the hotel that my reservation went through .
__label__0 First off , $ 150 is well above my usual hotel budget !
__label__0 # 1 in Carib for me ...
__label__0 Did n't make sense to me , Does it to you ?
__label__1 I can often get economical flights to Hawaii or Mexico without much notice -LRB- from Seattle , for example -RRB- .
__label__0 Any recommendations about which of these two regions would offer the best foliage ?
__label__1 If you are unsure , you should be able to pick them up in any chemist or heath shop once you arrive .
__label__0 Hi , everyone !
__label__0 I found that the flights at the brochure price are often airlines or routings that I would not choose -- for example , while I do n't mind flying KLM , I do not like that bus ride to Montreal to make the connection .
__label__0 We have never done a trip like this before .
__label__0 We 've booked the Jordan Experience tour starting 4Apr2008 .
__label__0 I hope that they showed their appreciation to the driver at the end in the amount of his gratuity .
__label__0 My sister still has some of my stuff in her garage .
__label__0 Well , sort of .
__label__0 YonYon , I do n't know why Chris left the Insight Board .
__label__0 I would be concerned that the trains might be on strike even if just for an hour , you will find that in Italy they have strikes very often.
__label__0 Mind you a limo in Rome is a big car like a Statemans and were charged 50 euro which we consider fair for the ease of having been met at the airport with someone holding our name and after a long flight from OZ we really did appreciate that .

__label__1 I did take seat covers on my first tour but did not use them .
__label__1 Saying that Insight and Trafalgar are the only companies that I would ever think of going with .

__label__1 My husband also uses a CPAP .
__label__1 I suggest not going for an all inclusive since there are so many good restaurants to choose from .

__label__0 I had a fleece and another light jacket to layer when necessary .
__label__0 What was your process , and where did you leave it all ?

__label__1 I also wore them all through Turkey in the mosques and had no problem .
