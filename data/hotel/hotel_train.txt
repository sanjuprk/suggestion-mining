__label__0 the rooms were fairly dirty.
__label__0 The place was spotless, even with a convention going on.
__label__0 Pool was warm, hot tub was non-existent it was covered up or under construction on what looked to be not touched in a long time.
__label__0 We love the pink, the private beach, the whole opulent feel of the hotel.
__label__1 Overall, if cost is a main concern, and you want stay in a basic room for $50 with decent service, in an acceptable neighborhood, then you apparently dont have enough $$$ to stay in a San Francisco hotel, try an upgrade to a local hostel, or stay home.
__label__1 after making the reservation, call the hotel and advise you have an upgrade coupon.
__label__0 I spent two hours in the business center preparing business related emails.
__label__0 In fact the room was used to store suitcases for people checking out of their rooms.
__label__0 The lobby is beautiful.
__label__0 In the end, not even close to worth it.
__label__0 The smell never made it pass the lobby
__label__0 while my quote was abt $200 a night -- in fact I paid abt $300 a night.
__label__0 Hotel is right adjacent to Berliner Dom (Berlin Cathedral) and the Museum Island with a huge choice of museums.
__label__1 A must if you have an unlimited expense account since the rooms are very expensive but certainly worthwhile
__label__0 Hopped onto a tram from Central Station but unfortunately nobody spoke English so we missed our stop, but found after going into one of the shops nearby.
__label__0 the staff argued.
__label__0 we were about a 25 minutte walk to Pioneer Square about 15 minute walk to Pike Place Mareket and a 20 minute walk to Space Needle / EMP.
__label__0 It was clean, modern and spacious enough.
__label__0 Beach and pool area topless.
__label__0 We did not so I would book priemer next time.
__label__0 With the subway system you are not far from anything in this town regardless where you stay.
__label__0 We enjoyed this hotel and its location very much.
__label__0 All the staff were very friendly, especially Rene, and if youre there on a Tuesday theres a nice touch of a drinks reception where management and guests mingle.
__label__0 Plus, many others werent enamored with their accomodations.
__label__0 but extremely clean and decor has been upgraded with a modern contemporary look/feel.
__label__0 I had to pinch myself to believe it was actually happening.
__label__0 Centrally located hotel is a few blocks from the water and from popular nightlife and shopping options in Belltown and downtown.
__label__0 Second, the staff.
__label__0 The bird droppings often found in the Mirador Grill usually found on the plates and tables did not help.....disgusting and certainly not acceptable in the light of the bird epidemic.
__label__0 Checking out at 10.55 on Sunday was not a good plan, as all six queues for reception were enormous - this could of course have been avoided by getting up earlier or doing express check out.
__label__0 We could not have picked a better location.
__label__0 Dave and Maxine Johnson Maine,USA
__label__0 I havent been here for some 20 years and I dont recall too much.
__label__0 The beds and fitness center made it definitely not like a usual Westin stay.
__label__1 Berlin is a top city and highly recommended for New Year!
__label__0 Managers reception is kind of sad w/ plastic cups instead of glass.
__label__0 We were too tired to wait so we slept under the comforter that Im guessing is not launderd after every guest - ick.
__label__0 They even left some sugar energy tablet things on the pillow to help get over jet lag.
__label__0 The king bed was truly comfortable and our kids ,5 and 10, stayed on the sofa sleeper and did not complain once.
__label__0 My hubby and I just returned from a 1 week stay at the Majestic.
__label__0 We chose this resort because it, supposedly, had a first class golf course very near the resort.
__label__0 one renovated where the kids stayed,
__label__0 I would never consider staying here for rack rate but for a priceline stay, it's fine.
__label__1 Made an excellent recommendation or dinner-Tommys...you have to eat there
__label__0 We were quite surprised since we hadnt made any special requests and were just supposed to get a standard room.
__label__0 Overall, I enjoyed our stay,
__label__0 Im originally from the City and have known of the Mosser ,especially the dive hotel it was back in the 1980s,.
__label__0 The tub drain needsattention, the shower curtain has holes in it.
__label__0 Pool : Beautiful, well kept, lots of shade and the swim up bar was great.
__label__0 Additionally, with the weather being cool, we didnt have any issues with the lack of air conditioning, which I could foresee as a problem in the heat.
__label__0 I was surprised to see that the AAA rating on this hotel, along with many others in New Orleans, was only 3 stars.
__label__0 but it was stone cold.
__label__0 Teds Montana Grill opened the week that i was there and I wanted to get some buffalo steak.
__label__0 This is a great starting point to explore the both east  West Berlin.
__label__0 Many thanks to the General Manager, Allen Kramme, for his note of welcome and the fruits and water on arrival.
__label__0 We made our reservations each day at 11am for the same evening with no problems.
__label__0 The reason I chose this hotel was primarily price, and location within easy walking distance of the convention center.
__label__0 Not did it have any of the normal four-star features like tea-bags, biscuits, pillow chocolate etc. We had to ask for a bath robe.
__label__0 Everything is cooked well��_��__ it tastes like American food.
__label__0 The price we paid and the service provided us has not been of 5***** Quality and the reason are: Transportation to the hotel was very confusing.
__label__0 Two full size beds in a tiny closet of a room ,1107, with four people, three over 58 tall.
__label__0 Throughout the stay the hotel staff were all very helpful and polite, and of course all spoke excellent English - as usual compounding my misery at being uni-lingual!
__label__0 but maybe the next night they would be able to move us to a higher room with a view.
__label__0 The room was clean and comfortable.
__label__0 In addition, when we met up with our friends and they helped us unload our luggage, the lady from the front desk ran out and confronted us about having extra people.
__label__0 Arrived in N.O. La via Amtrak.
__label__0 but it was two twins put together.
__label__0 All you good people.
__label__0 So with the window also came all the city noise.
__label__0 Great hotel with great Staff
__label__1 but we could never figure out how that worked (do some research before you go!!).
__label__0 It was a great boutique hotel that had the personal feel that I was looking for.
__label__0 The room also had ironing facilites.
__label__0 I requested to be put on a waiting list
__label__0 There was only one problem which was a little let down:there was a connecting door to the room next to us and at around 4 oclock in the morning people were talking so loud, that we could not sleep any longer.
__label__0 The room in fairness was very spacious and included its own area for the wardrobe, a free to use safe, small table and chair in the middle of the floor (and a pretty stained floor at that) and a small kitchenette in the corner (although nothing is included to use with it so unless you bring your own pots, pans and cutlery I see little point in this being here).
__label__0 Preciados is centrally located and within walking distance of the major sites in Madrid: Puerta del Sol, Teatro Opera, the Palacio Real, Catedral Almudena, etc.
__label__0 Our room was a good size, clean and comfortable.
__label__0 Sure, the Alsterhof is in a great location,
__label__0 and restrooms for the restaurant and bar are located.
__label__0 Lovely little boutique hotel
__label__0 the only saviour was the ARTOTEL across the street which had a nice bar
__label__0 We were on the street side of the hotel, and the street was pretty noisy with people all night long.
__label__0 The location is miserable if you are looking for any food or toiletries.
__label__0 and they did not have any?!?!
__label__0 Close to Bourbon Street.
__label__0 When we got to the front desk, we were told that we didn't have a reservation
__label__0 I always got my eggs or omleets prepared by the cook to ensure they were fresh.
__label__0 The location is quite good.
__label__0 We got up in the middle of the night to crank up the AC and open the window, but the temperature didn't change.
__label__0 my son asked very politely at the reception to borrow 2 forks, guess what...we weren't allowed!!
__label__0 My mini bar was locked
__label__0 At night there is not much Adult entertainment.
__label__0 Her response was, oh Ill take care of it.
__label__0 The hotel itself is old,
__label__0 Reception staff smiley and helpfull, okay the room was small but spotless, well comfy beds, great view across berlin and breakfast well and truly fed us.
__label__0 Great location if you need to be in the center of everything
__label__0 The resort is about 25 minutes away from the airport.
__label__0 Also has a neat candy machine in the room that is a nickle for some hot tamale candy.
__label__0 and there was a gap between the bedside table and the mattress!!
__label__0 We joined a tour group out of Singapore to Eastern Europe
__label__0 The lack of a pillow service is remarkable for a 5 star hotel.
__label__0 It is far from the downtown area but not too difficult to get there as long as you arent expecting a 5 minute trip.
__label__0 but this was the highest price we ever spent on a Youth hostel style-room.
__label__0 It was also strange to be handed a key, rather than a card for the room,
__label__0 The table outside of the elevator had garbage on it
__label__0 This hotel does not disappoint as a reasonably priced stay in the downtown area.
__label__0 just a small rail that pulled out from the end of the bed, which was set against a wall.
__label__0 At check in, we were given 2 dinner reservation tickets for reservations in one of the Fiesta resorts many alla carte restaurants ,vs. the large buffets where reservations are not necessary,.
__label__0 Whether it is cheesy/funny or just plain good, you will enjoy it.
__label__0 They had a great wine selection from all over Italy.
__label__0 I have read from the review that there was this kind of problem before but didnt think this should happen oftenly.
__label__0 The amenities were lackluster,
__label__0 Feel free to email me with questions.
__label__0 The front desk staff, the doormen, the breakfast staff, EVERYONE is incredibly friendly and helpful and warm and welcoming.
__label__0 We had travelled from fiji to Auckland, sat in Auckland airport all day then had a 12 hour flight to San Francisco.
__label__0 We left a detailed message the following morning but received no response that day and the following day was her day off.
__label__0 and in-room internet was $11 a day.
__label__0 The employees are very helpful and knowledgeble ,overheard a desk clerk explaining our California Mission system to a foreigner,, though not overly solicitous ,with hand out,.
__label__0 I stayed in this hotel for a week on a business trip.
__label__0 Very impressed with rooms for the price paid.
__label__0 The room was VERY warm all night long (and this was in a cold night in November).
__label__0 From the moment we booked the room we were treated wonderfully.
__label__0 Even the bathroom sparkled.
__label__0 Hotel is good for a home base, but not real big ,no business center, etc,.
__label__0 Seems people are i, surprised and delighted to see a dog in the lift ii, perhaps missing their own pets.
__label__0 The rooms all have cable TV and theres free internet access in the lobby.
__label__0 it is not a good value at all,
__label__1 Take our advice, stay at home, save your money if this is where you plan to vacation.
__label__0 And the rooms must be well insulated, because I did not ever notice any jet engine noise.
__label__0 There are many positive things about the hotel.
__label__0 The beach...... the sand is white the water is crystal clear and warm, and nice blue color.
__label__0 However, we were a little disappointed with the selection and quality of food served in the club.
__label__0 The hotel is very clean but somewhat dingy.
__label__0 The rooms are big and the hotel its self is clean.
__label__0 I have been to Punta Cana before and stayed at a Riu resort which was nice but I liked this much better.
__label__0 We liked the in-room refrigerator.
__label__0 We will definitely stay there again.
__label__0 We could not sit on our 25th floor balcony and enjoy the ocean views without the daytime sounds of ear-splitting, pile-driving machines and other construction equipment.
__label__0 My twin room was small for two and air conditioning barely adequate.
__label__0 I tried three rooms
__label__0 We noticed the same workers cleaning @ 7 AM were later serving dinners @ 8 PM.
__label__0 I can go on and on about the Outrigger, but I will end it here.
__label__0 The room air conditioning had a hard time keeping up with the warm temperatures in Berlin.
__label__0 Not Worth the Savings
__label__0 The valet met me at the door, let me in, and was very pleasant.
__label__0 Good price ,$200, for a clean, safe, mid-town room ,2 double beds, that includes breakfast.
__label__0 Everything looks sharp and the hotel is well-run.
__label__0 My husband and I do not dive very often so we always research dive shops before we go diving with them.
__label__0 Overall, an excellent choice
__label__0 Summary: I would stay there again ANYTIME: highly recommendable.
__label__0 and service was very slow and offer priced.
__label__0 We are in our 50s and enjoyed the contact with the families with young children.
__label__0 Im turning GREEN so knowing I was helping give back was also a HUGE plus
__label__0 We wanted to make dinner reservations for two nights and asked whether we needed reservations for a third restaurant.
__label__0 Arrived around 3 PM and had no problem checking in early.
__label__0 Free breakfast was good and the valet guys were good.
__label__0 The shower sprayed more water over the curtian then into the bath itself,
__label__0 Avoid this Sweat Shop Resort
__label__0 and coffee cups were dirty,
__label__0 The best thing here is location too: on the edge of trendy Belltown with great restaurants in walking distance, and the shops a couple of blocks away.
__label__0 Chair upholstery needs to be cleaned.
__label__0 I had a mixed experience in relation to this hotel.
__label__0 We also all raved about the place and were mad we hadnt left more time to enjoy it.
__label__0 It was everything a 5 star hotel should be and more!
__label__0 there were no robes.
__label__0 Another comfortable chair in the room, there's one, would be a plus We only ate one breakfast here because we slept in, but its a bit expensive.
__label__0 But best of all in her opinion were the iMacs and free internet access on every other floor, with the Starbucks leading off the front lobby a close second.
__label__0 I found the rating in the other reviews were good,
__label__0 I have a larger laptop
__label__0 Not enough towels or sometimes nothing until 6pm.
__label__0 but the view and staff were outstanding.
__label__0 Its a beautifully designed, well appointed and friendly staffed hotel.
__label__0 AND they lost the most important box of the lot.
__label__0 We thought a better idea would have been to park at one of the all night parking lots in the French Quarter for $10 to save $$$$.
__label__0 This had not been the case in 2005 when folks seemed cold...
__label__0 Its not in the prettiest part of town, but the area is quite safe and is abviously being redeveloped with trendy apartments.
__label__0 It is ideally placed to tour Berlin from.
__label__0 and each time I've been tempted to stay elsewhere in Seattle and have always ended up back at the Andra.
__label__0 Well served by buses and a metro station less than 5 minutes walk away.
__label__0 Saturday morning I got up, worked out, and went looking for breakfast.
__label__0 The room was clean, laundry request was excellent but expensive.
__label__0 Our room (superior double) was very spacious and extremely comfortable - with a bath for relaxing those tired walking muscles.
__label__0 The staff were extremely pleasant and helpful, the room was very comfortable and quiet and the location was ideal.
__label__0 Location is great; the rooms are comfortable; the amenities ,morning paper, free wine in the evening, high-speed internet, are perfectly lovely; the adjoining restaurant great for breakfast ,I didnt eat dinner there, but it looked filled up when I stuck my head in,; the New Yorker magazine theme in the lobby and the library fun.
__label__0 This way they will be held until you return.
__label__0 and so showering each morning was quite difficult.
__label__0 The staff members were generally very helpful and pleasant.
__label__1 If you are looking for a few nice dinner restaurants, we loved Legal Seafood , at the Wharf, and Plaza III Kansas City Steakhouse , at Fanueil Hall/South Market,.
__label__0 No Space Needle, no view.
__label__0 they said they haven't honored that for weeks.
__label__0 and they used to be great.
__label__0 As this is a quite large luxury hotel, the rooms are really small.
__label__0 Breakfast expensive, supermarket not far, Good value Internet cafe nearby.
__label__0 The hotel was very modern, clean and ther staff were all very helpful and spoke good English.
__label__0 HI We have stayed in this hotel twice and are staying again later this year, for the value its great is this hotel,
__label__0 Lastly housekeeping came to the rooms as early as 7:30. To solve this problem I put the Do Not Disturb sign up till I left the room in the mornings.
__label__0 so we contacted the hotel after arriving in Seattle.
__label__0 kind of set in a walled garden area.
__label__0 If you enjoy a great Marguerita or a Pina Colada, sadly you are not gonna get it here.
__label__0 When we called the front desk about the noise factor, the day person told us they did not have another suite and the couple next door was checking out.
__label__0 The jacuzzi was hot and did not work well if at all.
__label__0 However the best thing about the room was the wonderful view of the Boston skyline.
__label__0 Check in was very smooth and fast, and they gave me exactly the room I had requested.
__label__0 They finally responded to the problem 3 hours later and offered to switch my room, which was not an opinion because I had already unpacked.
__label__0 It was more to relax, enjoy the beach, and have some decent food.
__label__0 Throughout our stay we would often liase with recpeption staff, but again they were always unhelpful.
__label__0 Will definately stay there again
__label__0 But, this is not the only hotel in the area - The Hilton is just a few blocks away as are a few others that are in the 5 star range.
__label__0 It really was gorgeous
__label__0 The only good thing we can say it that the hotel is in a very good position just off ku'damm and great for exploring Berlin.
__label__0 Overall a great stay and the shopping was brill, much better than NY.
__label__0 I have written a previous review on the Alsterhof and having stayed there again,
__label__1 Highly recommend it.
__label__0 The owners were very nice and helpful.
__label__0 A family of 4 cost about $200, so your not dealing with a bunch of out of control kids running around with one adult trying to wrangle them, these people are paying very good money for the day use only of these things, and are not a problem at all.
__label__0 But when you arrive, the room was great.
__label__0 I'm from new york
__label__0 art'otel, Mitte in Berlin definitely fulfilled these requirements.
__label__0 The first day, the maid took the tip and left me a thank you note.
__label__0 Great I really dont understand how people can have a bad experience with this hotel, the one thing that made it such a nice place was the staff, they are sooo friendly
__label__0 We love boutique hotels with eclectic features, so this was a good fit for us.
__label__0 Staying on the club floor we got an awesome continental breakfast.
__label__0 The big message from the front desk is that they are too busy and don't care.
__label__0 The hotel is small --- 83 rooms --- and does not have a restaurant.
__label__0 Most of the time we got no bottle water for cleaning the teeeth or drinking.
__label__0 If I was expecting the Hyatt, Id have been disappointed, but, for someone who travels extensively for work, this beats many chains hands-down
__label__0 Treadmills were in very bad need of repair.
__label__0 The fruit selection was outstanding.
__label__0 It is a GREAT little store with drinks, snacks, microwaveable meals, etc.
__label__0 but they held our bags for us  we just went out and grabbed some lunch.
__label__0 It was around the same price as some of the more traditional hotels on La Ramblas but you got so much more for your money.
__label__0 The breakfast was good and the staff friendly.
__label__0 The hotel itself is pretty nice.
__label__0 We stayed at Hilton Berlin in early June, 2006.
__label__1 I would not recommend staying here,
__label__0 Now we are having second thoughts of making this trip to just discover a repeat performance of disappointment.
__label__0 It was in walking distance to all the major stores and resturant.
__label__0 There was a flatscreen TV, Starbucks coffee and Bliss products in the room.
__label__1 If you want to feel the city vibes and eat close by at more authentic restaurants, dont stay here.
__label__0 Very long days with scuba and excursions.
__label__0 Parking: $20 for in-out space, with $2 city tax = $22.
__label__0 Also, while I remember lots of bars, I didnt remember seeing as many of the, hmm, adult-type places as I did this time.
__label__0 The meal arrived in about 35 minutes and was v.good.
__label__0 Great value, great guy
__label__0 Our main concern with this property was that the staff overall was not very pleasant.
__label__0 My room was on the 16th floor facing the Space Needle.
__label__0 Tip- Upgrade for $30.00 to the club level and it includes 2 free breakfast buffets ( 43.00 savings ) The facilities are great the pool
__label__0 Heart of HollywoodO
__label__0 Just Fantastic I stayed there for 3 nights on my
__label__0 and we found ourselves sleeping directly on the mattress with bedding askew.
__label__0 It is really only a 10 minute drive from all the action.
__label__0 They work from sun up until very, very late at night and make next to nothing.
__label__0 Its 25Euros per person other wise.
__label__0 Check in was quick and effortless
__label__0 I told them that the Hilton didn't require extra ID
__label__0 We had problems and at first thought it was just us.
__label__0 My daughter took surfing lessons on the spot, which was very convenient.
__label__0 If we are ever back in Seattle, we will definatley stay at the Grand Hyatt
__label__0 On our arrival, we discovered that the hotel had overbooked
__label__0 The hotel has a Starbucks, Ruth Chris Steakhouse and The Cheesecake Factory.
__label__0 and I truly believe they were judging me on my appearance (regular - holiday mode, not powered up though!)
__label__0 The blankets were really, really worn, but the sheets seemed clean.
__label__0 The beds were so comfortable,it was hard to get up in the morning.
__label__0 When I approached the front desk for assistance, I was told that there was nothing they could do, and literally responded that it was not they're problem.
__label__0 This Hotel differs from the usual HI Exp as it was a little different because of all the old world touches with it being in part of the old Cotton Exchange, rather than a new purpose build hotel like many of the HI Exp.
__label__0 I had two bathrooms, a dining area, couch, wet bar and there is a Murphy bed in the living room so I suppose it would be great for families, or to sell if the place is sold out.
__label__0 We did not try the food in the two reservation only restaurants so I cant comment on those.
__label__0 (We were making jokes about it being left over from the Communist era.
__label__0 After dinner we returned to the Marriott for coffee and dessert.
__label__0 and because of the way the reservation was made we were stuck with 2 double beds.
__label__0 but only afterwards to discover all the food had gone - nothing left except the dregs!
__label__0 When I questioned how they did this, the staff argued with me rudely and insulted me.
__label__1 If you don't mind walking, you are only a couple blocks from Westlake shopping center and a few blocks from Pike's Marketplace.
__label__0 I booked a room with a single queen bed through Cheap Tickets and was happy with Divas responsiveness to my e-mail request to give us two beds , they gave us a room with a king and the Murphy bed, both very comfortable,.
__label__0 There is also a microwave with a free popcorn package, a coffee maker, and a little refrigerator in your vanity area.
__label__0 The hotels location could not be more perfect if you dont need to stay directly on the beach.
__label__0 but our trip was definitely marred by the accommodation.
__label__0 When I questioned this, I was told that as I had been 'miss told' they would remove it, but I was made to feel pretty bad about it.
__label__0 Once we arrived to the hotel,
__label__0 didn't book a room, set my mind that I wouldn't try to stay there again.
__label__0 Our room has always been very clean, quiet, and comfortable.
__label__0 Our room ended up not being ready until 6 PM that evening--arrived 3 PM.
__label__0 Check-in was efficient, mechanically so, but painless.
__label__0 From Hong Kong station, walk underground to Central station and then take the subway to Tin Hau for hotel.
__label__0 After check-in we moved to the bar for a couple of drinks and found this to be a fun place.
__label__0 With the Sofitel card we also had a 4 PM checkout which was great.
__label__0 The hotel itself is very nicely designed as well.
__label__0 Slept VERY well.
__label__0 Besides this the room was on the very busy street side and there were roadworks going on during the night.
__label__0 Only down side was with the luxury breakfast - we had real problems getting a seat and juice.
__label__0 YOU ARE NOT TO HAVE ONE!!!!"
__label__0 We ended up arriving at the Warwick at 10pm,
__label__0 We arrived at the hotel at 12pm, Eveyln at check in was very helpful but advised that only a room with a king size bed was available.
__label__0 The Pagoda was also the easiest one for reservations.
__label__0 THE MOVING FURNITURE SOUND UNCOVERED, it is the ceiling mounted radio speaker
__label__0 and we were offered free cocktails.
__label__0 You book a top floor, you get first floor, you booked a suite, and got a room...you go out to your balcony to relax...and someone from a top floor....,which you reserved, has just spit on the back of your head.
__label__0 It adds a cosy feel without losing the sleekness.
__label__0 The restaurant was also nice
__label__0 the people who work there are friendly.
__label__0 The use of the executive lounge is a bonus with free drinks and nibbles.
__label__0 ,Tokyo Hilton in Shinjuku is a close second.,
__label__0 We stayed at the Palladium Grand Bavaro.
__label__0 Best of all - all the staff are so friendly, informative and helpful.
__label__0 The 19 year olds and the 22 year olds went to the Star rock cafe at night.
__label__0 and there seemed to be a lot of unhappy hotel guests around us and at the check-in counter.
__label__0 Myslef and 10 friends stayed here for 5 nights over the first weekend in December.
__label__1 If you are a espresso lover, well this is for you.
__label__0 The cost of valet service wasn't really a problem here, but considering the size of the hotel, and the number of guests coming and leaving, there is a lot of congestion in the front and a considerable wait time.
__label__0 Its like stepping into my nans living room with brown and orange geometric patterned carpets and 70s furniture.
__label__0 We came home from the theatre the next night to find a note on our door asking us to keep the TV down because their baby was a light sleeper.
__label__0 The rooms are large.
__label__0 Elevator didnt appear to work.
__label__0 The staff shugged their shoulders and stated that that was the way they did things.
__label__0 It would not reach a warm temperature.
__label__0 each room was furnished with some Chihuly drawings.
__label__0 several cracked tiles in the bathroom and the bed was not kingsize.
__label__0 The weather, the tropical landscaping, and best of all the beach, rank above the others for a winter getaway.
__label__0 Also they seem to cater to conventions, large groups, so there are long waits for everything (elevator, bell boy, cashier, etc., and there usually 20 - 30 people out front smoking and blocking doorways.
__label__0 For the rate, it has to be the best value and the best comfort in San Francisco.
__label__0 Hotel amenities were excellent.
__label__0 thanks again Moore hotel!!
__label__0 You could hear the doors shut in the adjacent rooms as well, but overall it was a great experience for Times Square during the Christmas season.
__label__0 Stayed here for 2 nights last week.
__label__0 Although the room was good sized,
__label__0 The hotel was clean and the staff was very friendly.
__label__0 You have been warned, and we, I think, are nice people, who are often too timid to complain in any situation.
__label__0 My family, friends and I were attacked and assaulted right in the jacuzzi and the hotel staff did nothing to prevent or stop this until it was too late.
__label__0 We were in 1317 upper unit, directly behind the beach bar, for us that was great.
__label__0 One of the best hotels Ive ever stayed in.
__label__0 Not the greatest
__label__0 The second period was spent in a standard room which was also large, clean and with many extras - slippers , bath robe , hairdryer etc.The staff were very helpful and the only thing I did not like was the breakfast which is optional.
__label__0 Also liked the nice touch of having a bottle of mineral water in the room.
__label__0 And we did, we saw so much
__label__0 I also agree with many posters that the breakfast was great.
__label__0 They are unfounded.
__label__0 Terrible Behaviour, good breakfast
__label__0 If you rolled you would fall through the cracks.
__label__0 BUt it is about 15 mins from Hotel.
__label__0 Both fell into bed exhausted and tried to sleep...
__label__0 First, the line to make reservations was long ,wait time ranged from 10-25 mins,.
__label__0 Only a few minor issues - no shower curtain in the bathroom, the bed was a bit sunk in the middle, and our window faced another building.
__label__0 The hotel and its staff are excellent go and enjoy a fantastic city hotel.
__label__0 The room was on the corner, facing a really noisy street, which meant I had to keep the window shut at night.
__label__0 We stayed in the Westin Grand Berlin in July 2007.
__label__0 The lobby is grand in it's size, and is quite impressive.
__label__0 and it turned out they had apparently forgot to forward our reservation internally.
__label__0 We did not even attempt room service.
__label__0 and so we decided to splurge....what we DIDN'T know is that overnight parking in the Sheraton's garage is $40 per night.
__label__0 After travelling for 16 days across the USA, ie, Anaheim,Las Vegas New York, we were ready for some rest and relaxation and that is what we got.
__label__0 My son, another aquarian, referred to it as being steam cleaned.
__label__0 The hotel gives you two complimentary bottles of water in your room.
__label__0 Having never been to Seattle, I am pleased with the Warwick and my stay there.
__label__0 the internal decor/style of the rooms are reminiscent of the 1940s.
__label__0 Our number one complaint is that the hotel room smelled of mold/mildew.
__label__0 The room was great with partial ocean views and city views even though wed only paid for city views.
__label__0 The room is avarage in size.
__label__0 I would stay here again but I must say the price for food and drinks were a bit excessive.
__label__0 But I do intend to return to Seattle - great town!
__label__0 The beds are short sheeted which causes the bed to unravel
__label__0 This hotel is on the other side of the Piazza from the bus stop ,caddy corner to the large statue at the archway of the Piazza,.
__label__0 The bathroom was dated (compared to other hotels we had just visited), a pretty pathetic shower and a hole in the ceiling.
__label__0 I have my cancellation number.
__label__0 coffee maker.
__label__0 Boy, its going to be tough to write this review.
__label__0 I waited for another 45 minutes, still no one.
__label__0 Hotel offered free business center services,computer with internet access and printer,.
__label__0 The breakfasts are great - fresh fruit, bagels, muffins, hot eggs and sausage, etc.
__label__0 Not a far walk to the Duomo, farther walk to Ufizzi but manageable if you like to walk.
__label__0 Our only complaints concerned the front desk.
__label__0 Dont get me started. 
__label__0 We had to make an expensive call on our cellphone to the booking agency in Norway to get a confirmation that everything should be ok,
__label__0 The we went inside and the manager didnt really care.
__label__0 and I'm used to deal with every nationality
__label__0 My husband and I stayed here during a conference last week and it was alright.
__label__1 Easy walk to the beach and the aquarium ,highly recommend.
__label__0 A couple of other places that were comparable but a little pricier.
__label__0 Check-in a bit late - but it was a busy time for the hotel, and theres plenty to do just on the doorstep, so that was okay
__label__0 Good sized room, good location
__label__0 Why so dear??
__label__0 My room was spacious and the bathroom had both a deep, clean tub at one end and excellent shower at the other.
__label__0 Load of fresh fluffy towels.
__label__0 The tub also had long black hair stuck to it (gross).
__label__0 A full-length shower curtain would've been a much better option.
__label__0 This giant lot is catty-corner to the hotel and charges $32 a day.
__label__0 I had a nasty fall when the shower suddenly became very hot.
__label__0 We paid an extra $30 for an upgrade to an ocean view room and the view was fabulous
__label__0 I complained to the manager on duty the next morning
__label__0 The hotel itself is already showing signs of age.
__label__0 The lobby has walls of windows so it is always very bright and airy.
__label__0 Love the pink palace
__label__0 The hotel was in a perfect location to explore all the sights in Amsterdam.
__label__0 After I saw where the Crowne Plaza and Marriott was located, I was glad I won the Red Leeow bid, since we like being in the center of touristy things and this was it.
__label__0 But then it turns out that there where 2 rooms in my room.
__label__0 My business trip coincided with a 40,000 person convention and a marathon, so the stay was during a peak weekend and I was lucky to find the room for under $200.
__label__0 The only area of major concern for us was that we overheard a guest being asked to sleep at a neighboring resort for one night because they did not have room for him.
__label__0 It is more of a teal green.
__label__0 I didn't get a mini bar key at check-in, or for 3 hours after requesting one (and boy did I need a beer after being delayed on Alaska Air!).
__label__0 The room was clean, lots of towels ,a/c worked all good there, though it would have been nice to have a newly renovated room like some were, but for the time we spent in the room it wasnt a big deal either.
__label__0 Good coffee.
__label__0 They might have spoken to my sister and I more than others because we speak really good Spanish and this would pique their interest as to where we learned to speak the language.
__label__0 Neither had been made.
__label__0 The transfers worked smoothly and our accommodation in Vancouver was just as advertised.
__label__0 Most importantly, the staff were very helpful and friendly.
__label__0 We saw it later with other arrivals.
__label__1 However if you are travelling with a laptop they provide free internet in the rooms ,decent speed ~2mbps, ask at reception for pass code.
__label__0 As far as the grounds, the beach, and the pool, absolutely beautiful.
__label__0 Concierge: Very helpful The bads:Elevators: -- not enough and very slowCoffee shop: -- ridiculously expensive.
__label__0 Well placed for getting around the city.
__label__0 The bed sheets were old
__label__0 A Terrific San Francisco Choice
__label__0 Some of these people are too agressive and spoil the whole experience.
__label__0 We do not have kids of our own,
__label__0 The front desk staff was aloof and not interested in reparing the harm, and for that reason alone I would not stay there again.
__label__0 The staff was very pleasant,
__label__0 I stayed Savoy for two nights.
__label__0 Good vlue, terrible service
__label__0 We definitely will go back the next time we visit the area.
__label__0 Front staff are really trying to improve their customer service.
__label__0 Nice lobby with bar.
__label__0 while before someone could see us,
__label__0 there is too much against it to say this is a good hotel.
__label__0 They don't have a business center, gift shop, or wireless internet.
__label__0 Breakfast was good, especially the fresh-squeezed OJ.
__label__0 But they could still find a better room for an additional fee?
__label__0 it all seems to happen right next to you.
__label__0 A great experience - we will stay here again next time we travel down to Seattle for a getaway weekend!
__label__0 No colorful bed spread.
__label__0 I travel 3 of 4 weeks a month and found this property to be less than satisfactory
__label__0 Told her not happy about it.
__label__0 But what really sets it apart is the attentive staff and the above-and-beyond level of service and helpfulness.
__label__0 Now, the neighborhood immediately outside the door looks even safer
__label__0 You will have to take the train to get to Salem, too.
__label__1 Be careful snorkeling at Red Beach.
__label__0 Which doesn't make sense.
__label__0 This was not the case and we were charged $13 a day for the privelege.
__label__0 Loved it.
__label__0 Then you enter the bathroom.
__label__0 On arrival we were upgraded to one of the Garden Villas.
__label__0 From then on we used the stairs coming to and from the room
__label__0 Not really our scene.
__label__0 the room has a bed, a balcony, and a bathroom and that is it.
__label__0 A curious thing for me was, when I walked outside the hotel, every so often, from Friedrichstrasse to the Brandenburg Gate,
__label__0 We found only 4 bars and missing the other 3 which we read on the webside.
__label__0 but there were also many negatives.
__label__0 Vacation From Hell
__label__0 Half way through someone came over to help since he was looking for a tip.
__label__1 Rooms are clean and nice, but bear in mind you just pay for lodging, service does not seem to be included.
__label__0 the only instruction given was to turn right outside door and straight down.
__label__0 The hotel staff is very fluent in English and very knowledgeable about the city and what's going on.
__label__0 and also that I had booked a cheapie.
__label__0 Good central hotel.
__label__0 We thought that was a little odd for a king room.
__label__0 It was a normal sized regular room with a pull down bed with a small divider in the middle of the beds.
__label__0 The hotel is very basic
__label__0 but the whole place is in serious need of a refurbishment.
__label__0 A limo tour of Beverley Hills, Bbelaire and Rodeo Drive starts from Hollywood Bvd.
__label__0 The hotel itself was ok, fairly clean and decent location.
__label__0 A memeber of our group was sent to another hotel to iron her eveining clothes - when she returned stating that she could not find hotel they directed her the hotel opposite.
__label__0 The continental breakfast on offer was ideal with bagels ,cereals ,tea coffee, fresh fruit.
__label__0 The service was dreadful.
__label__0 We were there for our 2nd anniversary.
__label__0 Location is worth the other hassles of the hotel.
__label__0 Unfortunately i fell ill on our last day there.
__label__0 We had a small fridge with a mini bar, which had a selection of 6 drinks.
__label__0 Lobby large, sometimes a bit of music, comfortable.
__label__0 The windows did not open and the room was stuffy and hot.
__label__0 There are people working all over the hotel 24/7, gardening and keeping it clean.
__label__0 Having said that, I still ranked this hotel a 2 rather than a 1 because the breakfast buffet was fantastic, and the location was very convenient for sightseeing.
__label__0 We stayed at this hotel because it was near to K'damn
__label__0 The hotel is two blocks from the 6 line subway stop on 28th Street.
__label__0 We were told that the union tower rooms were newer and nicer
__label__0 Visited Seattle first time in August- to bicycle with cascade bike club up to Vancouver ( 180km).
__label__0 We informed the desk about both the pool
__label__0 This hotel is lovely.
__label__1 Try out a trabi safari - it is great fun - especially in 3ft of snow in a car with no heating......................
__label__0 Good position, nice staff and very clean rooms 
__label__0 When we finally got to talk to the Customer Relations representatives ,not very experienced ,, they flipped through the book for each restaurant and told us that all slots were taken.
__label__0 With that sole exception, the service was every bit as good as Ive come to expect from the Kimpton brand.
__label__1 I highly recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to avoid the giant impersonal hotels, as you will have all the amenities and none of the hassle.
__label__0 The beds were unreal.
__label__0 Bottom line.....Great value in Downtown Seattle and I would stay there again and again.
__label__0 The ones we went to seemed to be quite upscale so even the food court can be a bit pricey given the type of food served.
__label__0 No attempt was made to look for it.
__label__0 Our room was on the 25th floor and was quite nice.
__label__0 Dinner at Trader Vics _��_ Again OK, it was nothing to write home about.
__label__0 The room is on the "Club Level" and is about on par with a Radisson.
__label__0 Even though the hotel was fully sold out, they managed to put us into a full ocean view room for 4 nights.
__label__0 We were on 8th floor, so very little street noise- asked to be away from kids
__label__0 I recieved a knock at my door around 11:00am by another housekeeping to clean the room.
__label__0 They would be back in 15 minutes.
__label__0 I really could not fault this hotel - the lobby and bar area is spacious and the breakfast had a wide range to suit all tastes.
__label__0 No Bar, a makeshift breakfast room.
__label__0 Our room even had a fairly big closet.
__label__0 and the hotel served its purpose.
__label__0 The room was a bit shabby,
__label__0 My sister and I are a bit shy and like to keep to ourselves.
__label__0 There is only one restaurant but the hotel is close to the Hollywood and Highland complex with a choice of restaurants Italian, American, Japanese and sort of French.
__label__0 and I would pick it up after dinner.
__label__0 When we booked the room the description on the website said it came with a separate seating area, despite raising the issue with reception we were basically told this was not so , I guess someone needs to amend the website.
__label__0 This is somewhat true, but undestand that these people are paying abut $50 dollars per person for only the use of the swimming pool and a few of the other pleasures of the resort.
__label__0 The first year that we booked this hotel we called them directly (after booking our room with an on-line service) to comfirm that they were the same hotel that hosts the famous Ginger Bread House competition for the local chefs.
__label__0 This was our 1st all inclusive vacation as we usually go on cruises ,Royal Caribbean,.
__label__0 We loved Dukes Resturant.
__label__0 Another bummer for me was the bed was very soft ,albeit spacious and new,.
__label__0 We brought mosquito repellant and After Bite but did not see a real need to use this.
__label__1 Its not a luxury hotel but if you are looking for something a little outside the city, its a good choice and a good price for Amsterdam.
__label__0 The location was perfect, being close to Pike Market, shopping and the space needle.
__label__0 but they could not locate.
__label__0 I complained and was moved to a room that had a vacant room next door.
__label__0 The following day we were lucky with the towels, but found the poolside furniture dirty,
__label__0 Beach - We enjoyed it but we like diving and this is not a good beach for this.
__label__0 The animation ,entertainment, crew were terrific.
__label__1 Be aware of your surroundings at all times, and you wont be a victim.
__label__0 Overall, an average stay with below average beds.
__label__0 and I almost seemed to touch the floor as I hopped on it.
__label__0 For UK travellers, the room was the same size
__label__0 The hotel is located in Belltown where there are great restaurants, music clubs and bars everywhere.
__label__0 We took our dead bed bugs downstairs and spoke with Mike (the manager).
__label__0 but some of my colleagues have been near to the construction site
__label__0 There are lots of lovely local bars and cafes near the hotel ?
__label__0 There was no indication that they are trying to look for it.
__label__0 We were given a smoking room,
__label__0 I use TripAdvisor.com regularly so when I saw that the Radisson SAS Berlin had been rated the number one hotel in the city I was confident I would be in for something special.
__label__0 The fixtures and fittings in the room were tired and worn; edges of shelves worn away, carpets badly stained, window blinds torn and damaged.
__label__0 You cannot encounter a problem that could not be fixed.
__label__0 I liked that wine and soft drinks were available with honesty payments and a fridge to store your own purchases but felt it was a lack that there was no coffee or tea-making facilities either in room or in area where could have lunch.
__label__0 The Hilton accepted this without any drama; one staff in the exec lounge was at first unaware of the hotel policy on assistance dogs; one cleaning woman seemed to be terrified of the dog, otherwise Pema quickly become a favorite with the other hotel guests.
__label__1 Take my advise: spend your well earned money at King's Motel (1/2 block away) or at the Sheraton or Weston.
__label__0 I felt I was walking through a sewer.
__label__0 We found most beach front locations to be much more costly.
__label__0 Parking is $21/day which is pretty steep but the only option because parking in Seattle is scarce.
__label__0 The Warwick charges $23,
__label__0 the views are spectacular.
__label__0 The Shower just has a small shelf to put all your stuff on.Personally I will stay elsewhere next time I am over in the dam.
__label__0 The service is top rate.
__label__0 Anyway...
__label__0 This was my 3rd long stay at the hotel,
__label__0 Fortunately, I didn't have to wait long.
__label__0 whale watching tours and pottery barn locations) and we ended up doing our own research and bookings.
__label__0 The best service was from the Valets.
__label__0 I had to flag down the hostess in order to get my check.
__label__0 I really liked this place and will go back.
__label__0 not to bad, quite spacious and looked clean.
__label__0 If Oprah knew about the Mr. Steam showers at the Bryant Park, it would undoubtedly make her Favorite things list.
__label__0 And it fully lived up to our expectations
__label__1 Try and find a web deal (I booked via Hotel[-]): during Summer rooms can be booked for as low as 59 euro (and that includes breakfast).
__label__0 Doesnt feel like Japan hotel, more like a contemporary Hilton.
__label__0 Friendly staff at reception, bar and breakfast.
__label__0 What an unpleasant surprise!
__label__0 All and all we had a great stay!
__label__0 Bus n24 stops opposite the hotel and goes to Westminster, the Parliament, Trafalgar Square, Leicester Square, Tottenham Court ,British Museum,, Camden Town........Absolutely convenient.
__label__0 New York is a veritable smorgasbord of hotels ranging from sleezy to sublime.
__label__0 The bathroom door was a pocket metal door with a glass insert panel that slammed shut every time it closed.
__label__0 Ps. Cant find the camera.
__label__0 They weren't even apologetic.
__label__0 At 10:15 p.m. when we arrived, there was a HUGE tractor trailer with cars on it so we couldnt even pull up in frontI would definitely stay here again if I wanted something a bit less expensive than the giants downtown but clean, comfy, and up-to-date just like the good guys
__label__0 I stayed for two nights: with fees paid $62.00 on Hotwire per night.
__label__0 The room was really spacious with 2 queen beds, a desk and a little sitting area.
__label__0 We tried to get the movie cart so we could watch a movie ,no DVD players in the rooms, but whoever had the limited number they keep onhand did not return them while we were there so we never got one.
__label__0 Have an expensive coffee and pastry and soak in the sublime atmosphere.
__label__0 Knew the seminyak area well but hads never stayed at the Sofitel before.
__label__0 The front desk staff was really friendly and knew a lot about the city.
__label__0 The hotel is located about 15-20 minutes from central Hollywood, and is right in the center of Beverly Hills, on Beverwil Drive.
__label__0 There was no thermostat, just a hot and cold mixer tap.
__label__0 Fantastic hotel - will be going back asap
__label__0 I booked this hotel for less than $100 USD and it is one of the best values that I have ever received from a hotel.
__label__0 So clean and fresh everywhere.
__label__0 It looked so fresh and delicious
__label__0 It is called a LODGE...and thats exactly what it felt like.
__label__0 The room and beds (not comfortable) showed wear and looked the same as when I last stayed (90's)
__label__0 it was a sign i should have checked out immediately - at one point there wasn't even hot water in the hotel for over an hour.
__label__0 I was disgusted and appauled by his actions.
__label__0 Prices reflect what you get.
__label__0 and down the stairs everytime I wanted to go in or out.
__label__0 The staff went out of their way to help you, they are all so friendly, and try very hard to speak English.
__label__0 My room on the Club Level was brand new with a soothing updated look and excellent bedding.
__label__0 The water in the room is not drinkable,
__label__0 Better bring alot of extra cash.
__label__0 We were only able to eat at one of the a la carts, The Italian, because the other ones did not have a non-vege option.
__label__0 The food and service in the concierge lounge wasnt great.
__label__0 The bed was extremely comfortable.
__label__0 Also, the resort did not have top shelf liquor.
__label__0 Food was adequate and you are able to eat as much of it as you like.
__label__0 The resort is a tropical paradise.
__label__0 When you travel to the Caribbean you have to be prepared that not everything is going to be perfect, but you have to have a positive attitude and always make the best out of everything.
__label__0 We enjoyed a great breakfast the next morning in the hotel restaurant.
__label__0 I would classify this property as a three star location.
__label__0 It also was great to have access to the spa and pool before and after the race.
__label__0 Parking is valet-only which is $35/night, but they double-charge you w/an additional $35/night for parking.
__label__1 If youre looking for a reasonably priced nice hotel steps away from the beach, I would recommend staying at the Waikiki Parc.
__label__0 Their entire family lives with them in a 500 sq ft house.
__label__0 They serve Starbucks and a wicked cheesecake sampler platter ,$13, which easily fed us all - we may not have finished it all
__label__0 Great place and great people...
__label__0 The room - on the executive floor - could have used a good dusting.
__label__0 At 9 p.m. I asked again.
__label__0 There are a couple of downsides: the air conditioning works, but not very well.
__label__0 Breakfast is served till 11 in the heat restaurant.
__label__0 Azul was a fantastic meal - delicious contempory food and slick service but the only detractor was that it arrived on a cold plate.
__label__0 All things considered, the Luna Simone is a great hotel and we would stay there again.
__label__0 We were there the weekend before Halloween.
__label__1 We recommend visiting the excavation of the Aztec pyramids next to the national cathedral, about a five minute walk from the hotel.
__label__0 What a scam.
__label__0 We had requested connecting rooms when we booked and there were no problems at all with this.
__label__0 Plus, it was fairly quiet
__label__0 Everyone has their hand out (not unusual at a hotel like this, but even more blatant here -- and without much of a smile or effort) When I have to open my trunk and pack my bags in the car, it seems impertinent to be expecting a tip just for bringing the car up.
__label__0 You have to pay to use the sauna area.
__label__0 it took me 4 calls to the concierge before an alternative was provided.
__label__0 They were even baking cookies and making popcorn at 8.30 pm, when we still had no electricity.
__label__0 Just in the middle of everything...Museums, Restaurants, Public Transport and lots of Shops.
__label__0 Great attentive service as well.
__label__0 When we came back to our room we found a bottle of chilled champagne and a bag of goodies for us to eat.
__label__0 The iPod-dockable clock radio was on and softly playing some classical music.
__label__1 Put your valuables in a zippered pouch inside your clothing, dont carry a backpack, keep an eye on anything you put down beside you in a restaurant, walk in caravans, dont let people surround you on the metro: make sure you are near an exit door.
__label__0 Previous comments have been made about the road noise, which is noticeable, but Im not sure what else to expect on a busy road in a major city.
__label__0 The breakfasts were some of the best we had throughout our trip.
__label__0 Yes.It is very trendy.
__label__0 We had booked a standard room, but upon arrival we were asked if we wanted an upgrade to a superior room, for a very small surcharge.
__label__0 The Bahia ,Brazilian, restaurant offers a mini buffet selection during lunch time.
__label__0 When we checked in for our stay, we were a little annoyed that we had to wait for our room to be ready even though it was 21/2 hours past the check-in time.
__label__0 Poor Hotel and Staff
__label__0 The other thing we did not like is that, although the hotel has free WiFi, if you dont bring your laptop, using the hotels computers costs 6 euros an hour.
__label__0 This would have been funny were it not because we were on a rare break and, in addition, the room was tired, smelly, had a stained carpet and a stained armchair.
__label__0 Excellence, only a name?
__label__0 They also do a nice free breakfast snack of coffee/ tea and muffins and bagels.
__label__0 Location is close to all shopping,
__label__0 While there we visitied places like Pisa ,1hr, and Viareggio ,beaches 1hr 20mins, by train.
__label__0 Its less than a 5min walk from the station, so is a perfect base for visiting florence and surrounding towns/cities.
__label__0 The bathrooms are not the biggest, nor are the rooms, but this is NY, and how much time do you spend in your room anyway?
__label__0 On the third day our key would not work
__label__0 Service staff were very polite and helpful.
__label__0 I thought the hotel would be packed, but there seemed to be plenty of romms available.
__label__0 and the prices are outrageous for very average food.
__label__0 The food I ordered was not the food I recieved and the pizza was less than acceptable.
__label__0 Every night the kids were involved in putting on little shows.
__label__0 The pools are closed for repair.
__label__0 as we had paid for the excellence club we were whisked away on arrival and taken to an air- conditioned room , which we both welcomed being from Scotland, and were given a glass of bubbly.
__label__0 but the rooms are poorly decorated, with common furniture.
__label__0 The breakfast area next to the lobby was excellent with the morning sun beating in.
__label__0 Biggest complaint was the street noise especially Friday and Saturday nights.
__label__0 The hotel is understaffed and staff's knowledge of English isn't good.
__label__0 The resort was just bought by the Barcelo group and has been branded a four star.
__label__0 and the construction zone atmosphere down there was unpleasant.
__label__0 Fresh coffee is made for you from an impressive machine at reception.
__label__0 Friendly staff, good drinks and draft beer selection and a nice atmosphere.
__label__0 Fair enough, but I think there is only one floor in the whole building (of 7 floors) that is non-smoking, so be aware of that when booking.
__label__0 Alltogether I enjoyed my stay and would book again at anything below $120 a night.
__label__0 The location is great - not only is it walkable to many attractions, but it's in the middle of the downtown free bus zone,
__label__0 To think we had to pay a mandatory $76 per day per person for that slop.
__label__0 As someone who travels internationally, he commented on the rude and hostile behavior of the clerk.
__label__0 They did tell us we could go down and use the pool at the Westin
__label__0 The other block (directly above the main entrance) is still trapped in the 1970's time warp that's been mentioned by previous contributors.
__label__0 It seemed like they were updating some of the other floors, but they didn't get to that one yet.
__label__0 and gingerly approached the subject of the bed size.
__label__0 I only wanted oatmeal,
__label__0 and pillow were far too soft, which made me have a terrible time sleeping.
__label__0 From pressing the lift buttons for you to helping you in and out of taxis, to there genuine pleasure in serving you.
__label__0 I stayed in this Novotel because 1- it is relatively cheap, 2 - of the brand Novotel.
__label__0 The front desk staff could use a really good lesson on manners, professionalism, and genuine hospitality.
__label__0 The difference is with the hotel, you have in/out privileges and its the same price, whereas, if you park you car at one of the lots, once you leave, you have to pay again to re-enter
__label__0 These trams do not go in front of hotel.
__label__0 There are two bars an Irish bar a little more casual and the city bar very busy and a little more highbrow.
__label__0 Breakfast at 12 euros is pricey for what is available better to pop out to local cafe.
__label__0 and then notified me that the emails could not be delivered due to technical difficulties.
__label__0 If I hadnt been staying during a peak weekend, I would say that was an outrageous rate, however, given the circumstances, Id say it was fair.
__label__0 It was recently renovated and the hotel property did a very good job.
__label__0 No pool, no sauna, no whirlpool.
__label__0 Although this was advertised
__label__0 We ate from the pool food/bar which was fine, and then at the Hole in the Wall for dinner and then breakfast.
__label__0 We had a view of Mt. Rainier the first leg, lower down the second.
__label__0 The concierge Charles went out of his way to help us with tickets.
__label__0 This was situated in its own walled garden with water on 2 sides and a bath leading from the bathroom, surrounded by water.
__label__1 One thing you must ask for when checking in is a Majestic Passport.
__label__0 Did have the same problem with aircon but it was stuck on 23C not 25, so not such a problem.
__label__1 Dont forget to tip...
__label__0 I had booked a double room but got two single beds, with a folded duvet resting at the bottom of the bed;
__label__0 The first time before 8:00 a.m., and the second around 9:00 a.m. Upon reporting this to the reception on checking out, the clerk looked at me and said what is your problem?
__label__0 The street for shoes is close by as is the night market stalls.
__label__0 The complaints we have expressed in this letter are a brief overview and do not constitute a comprehensive list of the problems we encountered at the hotel.
__label__0 but you do not worry too much about quality.
__label__0 I expect at least they should 1) if the room has not been rented out, send someone to check; or 2) if the room was rented out, send a message to the new guest.
__label__0 I booked this hotel on hotwire and got a great price of 107 p/n for a weekend.
__label__0 That made all their restaurants under some degree of renovation with no clear plan on how to provide food services to their guests.
__label__0 and runners go by from my window.
__label__0 Trapped in Paradise
__label__0 We were booked to stay a third night, but were planning on going elsewhere.
__label__0 The shows at night were very entertaining.
__label__0 Overall found most of the hotel staff to be very responsive  helpful.
__label__0 and they happily supplied 2 nice comfy ones...no charge.
__label__0 I see good reviews of the Warwick
__label__1 If you go to the Mexican, dont leave without savoring mega amounts of a local topping called pico de gauaio.
__label__0 2. The pillows are awful, too soft.
__label__0 we paid extra for the wedding package, room upgrade and the excellence club, it was money well spent.
__label__0 Translate it: Old and unrelenting.
__label__0 We booked a reservation at the Hotel Globus through its web-site based of the good reviews that we read on tripadvisor.
__label__0 The other motel like feature were thin and rough towels.
__label__0 We spent our days going back and forth between the beach ,absolutely beautiful clear water and white soft, sand, and the pool.
__label__0 But at least it was quiet.
__label__0 If I ever book the Alsterhof again, I'll be sure to ask for a decent bed!
__label__0 So....I was obsessive about reading the reviews and checking out the forums for the PCP for weeks before my trip and all I can say is this resort is fantastic.
__label__0 Despite that the service was great, the room was luxurious and we had a great time.
__label__0 and we were pleasantly surprised at the great continental breakfast.
__label__0 Truly worth staying at this hotel.
__label__0 I was however given some hotel slippers and a robe (after I asked, not on entry).
__label__0 There are plenty of hotels to choose from in the area.
__label__0 Parking was quite expensive.
__label__0 We went every day.
__label__0 My husband was in New Jersey for business so our children and I ,8 yr old and 8 mo old, joined him in NYC for a long weekend.
__label__0 We were transferred to another hotel having been told that there has been an issue with their computer (and that 25 other people were also affected).
__label__1 If you prefer large corporate-style hotels this may not be the place for you.
__label__0 and Public Transportation system were not running at full capacity.
__label__0 while we were waiting on the street.
__label__0 The housekeeping staff was quite pleasant.
__label__0 Its $8 per page, they take about 40 pictures and you pay for what you want.
__label__0 It's true that the hotel does not have the frills of other downtown hotels
__label__0 Not at all what I would expect from a four star hotel.
__label__0 and our main dishes achieved an unusual condition in that they were both over-cooked and cold.
__label__0 The location of the hotel, while initially I had misgivings, is not too bad.
__label__0 The service was above average, but not as excellent as all of the reviews that I had read.
__label__0 Everything you could imagine from cereals to freshly made pancakes with maple syrup(recommended).
__label__0 Some of the people who were travelling with the same supplier were really negative ,one even complained about the wind being too loud and needing ear plugs,,
__label__0 Sometimes, the smoke is drifting through the lobby and makes the whole place very unpleasant.
__label__0 False advertising aside, I feel as if I didnt get the exclusive all inclusive treatment that they advertise and that I paid for.
__label__0 The place is right out of a bad seventies movie,
__label__0 They had champagne and chocolates waiting for us along with 2 teddy bears to keep.
__label__0 Our rate inclued and extensive buffet breakfast - VERY nice, with an omlette bar and wide variety of hot and cold foods.
__label__0 I think they might intentionally give my room to the other with higher rates.
__label__0 The Kimberly Hotel was in a great location, the staff could not be more helpful and the rooms were large enough to accommodate a crabby teenager and mother without any fuss.
__label__0 The in-room facilities have it all, although no flat screen TVs yet.
__label__0 but very nice fellow who acted as doorman during the day.
__label__0 I decided to stay in
__label__0 It is true, you have to see it to believe it.The room was spacious, beautiful arrangements of fresh flowers everywhere in the hotel, and the staff was always gracious.
__label__0 For some reason we were given the honeymoon treatment with fresh fruit etc. a lovely surprise.
__label__0 The construction noise was VERY loud.
__label__0 and the hot-tub and they stated they were cleaned regularly and were operating as they should.
__label__0 Stayed at the Singel for 2 nights for a football trip, the place is easy to find, in a good location, near the station,on the Singel canal, next to a church.
__label__0 Exceeded our expectations
__label__0 The building was characteristically New Orleans and made me feel like I was staying with family or friends rather than at a hotel.
__label__0 It was not really useful for anything due to its size and number of functions that it was supposed to perform.
__label__0 After about ten minutes of lugging our luggage around we found an old building which later we found was the sister hotel.
__label__0 There is major construction going on at this hotel.
__label__0 Over all I think I would stay here again, location was great and for the price the standard of furnishings and quality was top notch
__label__0 The woman at the desk let me know there were 10 minutes left and that I might want to swing through there before going to my room to get a couple glasses to take up with me.
__label__0 I felt right at home in the neighborhood of the Monarch, then again I live right outside of Newark NJ, which explains why our car was keyed and our mirror was ripped off.
__label__0 Dont expect much for the light continental breakfast ,nothing fresh,.
__label__0 This time I stayed for two nights
__label__0 but it all worked and felt really comfortable.
__label__0 605 for four nights.
__label__0 Breakfast was fine european standard with fresh fruit, however we could ask for a cup of capucinno or even a glass of hot chocolate.
__label__0 However, we did eat at several of the restaurants nearby and enjoyed all of them.
__label__0 Overall it was an o.k. experience, but I would probably try somewhere else the next time.
__label__0 Think twice before spending the money.....we will never return even if it were FREE.
__label__0 It was hard and REALLY uncomfortable.
__label__0 and refurbishment is finished but not before then.
__label__0 and there is a small gourmet supermarket across the street open until 1AM.
__label__0 The soda was odd, the tonic was odd and the OJ tasted like tang.
__label__0 Luckily another staff member intervened and, although he didnt tell us anything different his manner was more acceptable.
__label__0 We stayed in a 1 bedroom lake view suit.
__label__0 Lots of fun Me and my girlfriend just returned from the bravelo beach resort in Punta Cana, and we were overall very satisfied.
__label__0 Well, it didnt let us down.
__label__0 We have stayed at the Moore several times over the past 8 years.
__label__0 Was it because they thought I had got the room too cheap?,
__label__0 Im picky when it comes to Thai food, and this met my high standards, and had lovely decor.
__label__0 Bottom line, it is a great value but it does have some significant problems if you are in the wrong room.
__label__0 ,Hotel does not have horses, you would book this separately,.
__label__0 I took a walk through the hotel.
__label__0 To me ,and I am a foodie from SF, this is not a deal breaker.
__label__0 Excellent location - calm yet only a 10 minute walk from the Museeninsel, with the U-Bahn in front of the hotel.
__label__0 Nearest subway station was St Augustin or Madeleine.
__label__0 especially with the balcony door closed.
__label__0 Bit of a dissappointment to be honest.
__label__0 The size and amenities were no different from a good Best Western.
__label__0 The carpets in the registration and elevator area need cleaning.
__label__0 We requested a smoking room on an upper floor with a Space Needle view.
__label__0 Just got back from our vacation in Italy in which we stayed three nights at this hotel.
__label__0 No air-conditioning, characterless rooms althought they were clean.
__label__0 The rooms were quite nice and clean.
__label__0 Then you enter the room.
__label__0 We actually had to turn off the air conditioner and leave the door open to get some fresh air.
__label__0 The staff seemed nice enough and helpful.
__label__0 I was at the Iberostar Bavaro with friends and family.
__label__0 Stayed here for a hen trip with 3 of my girlfriends for 3 nights.
__label__0 As I said I would recommend this resort to anyone wanting to relax, be totally pampered, and enjoy some of the benefits of the good life.
__label__0 Bathroom hairdryer is impossible to style your hair with,
__label__0 For what we paid I have nothing to complain about, and will happily return.
__label__0 I had the BEST Mexican food I have ever eaten - very inexpensive
__label__0 It was in a good area.
__label__0 The Hunt Grill was wonderful- try the crab bisque and crab cakes.
__label__1 If you have the chance, go for the brand new Radisson, Hyatt, Marriott or Adlon.
__label__0 and we certainly got that.
__label__0 The food was less than adequate.
__label__0 Although I was on the nonsmoking floor(5th) both the hallway
__label__0 and not what we had booked.
__label__1 Avoid it.
__label__0 the dining room is elegant!
__label__0 There was also problems with getting a late checkout - because our flight out was at 6pm,
__label__0 In addition, the hotel is not very nice.
__label__0 That felt good to know that on our first trip, we hit it on the mark with our hotel choice
__label__0 We only ate at Passions and the food was soo good.
__label__0 Not knowing that the cabs did not return to that area.
__label__0 Great Location ,behind the Flower Markets,
__label__0 Waited for about 20 minutes and a room became available,
__label__0 We spent 5 days at this hotel in August 2007 and will be looking no further when we return to Honolulu.
__label__0 Room was large and well laid out.
__label__0 Im an HHonors member so stay in Hiltons all over, but this is my favorite.
__label__0 We had no trouble getting anywhere we wanted to go because of the exceptional concergie service.
__label__0 It was lovely, and looked very recently done.
__label__1 I highly recommend this hotel especially for couples.
__label__0 No apology from the staff just a statement that it would be ready at 1 maybe 2. Surly staff behind front desk
__label__0 Our room was delightful.
__label__0 I had a good dinner at Bamboo ,japanese, one night but was not able to get in for the rest of my stay.
__label__0 and the receptionist simply looked up the reservation in her system, pointed to the crossroads and informed us that the hotel we were staying in was around the corner and four minutes away.
__label__0 The restaurant I liked most offered Thai food, called Pagoda.
__label__0 The Sheraton Hotel is in a prime location in the heart of downtown Seattle.
__label__0 I thought Seattle was great - plenty of specialty shops, restaraunts, coffee shops, pubs, and clubs, plus the water.
__label__0 We just said WOW.
__label__0 The guest service simply said that we have your inquiry on file.
__label__0 Room was kind of small but we were hardly in it.
__label__0 Poor Service --
__label__0 The pool area is nice but the pool itself could use a good scrub down.
__label__0 A few days later a co-worker called and was able to book a room and received the government rate.
__label__0 Note, it was a 15-20 minute walk to a cheap internet cafe (open till eleven-thirty) attached to a dunkin donuts on Ku'damm.
__label__0 The hotel is about a five minute walk to the Berlin Zoo, and maybe a fifteen minute walk to Postdamer Platz.
__label__0 At all points of contact I felt welcomed  assisted in a professional but warm manner.
__label__0 The third night we came back at around 2ish.
__label__0 We had much better meals at the surrounding cafes/restaurants.
__label__0 I think they added about $.85 to a $1.90 quiche from the market up the street.
__label__0 The lighting is a weak point as well, and so is the noisyness between rooms.
__label__0 but the quality is poor.
__label__0 When we arrived at the hotel after a full day of travel the desk clerk kept us waiting for several minutes without so much as a hello.
__label__0 NOT BAD BUT........
__label__0 I stayed at Hotel Max for 9 days during a conference in early June, and it was an extremely good value.
__label__0 The fodd was tolerable and I always found somehting to eat, but honestly it just isnt very good.
__label__0 and by the time a fresh pot of coffee arrived,
__label__0 which housed both an all night liquor store and an all night all male theatre.
__label__0 It was not bad at all, but it wasnt all that great and the prices were a bit high, in my opinion, for a college town eatery.
__label__0 The lobby was not open (still under renovation, I guess) when we arrived, so the reception and concierge desks were shoved into a crowded hallway.
__label__0 Although the lobby appears relatively modern,
__label__0 Noticed straight away that we were not made to feel welcome,
__label__0 I would definately stay here again, the staff were very friendly, one of the nights we all gathered in reception on our way out we were quite noisy taking photos ,as we were on hen wkend, and the staff were more than happy to help take photos join in...I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Barcelona, great value for money
__label__0 No A.C.!
__label__0 Thank goodness there are plenty of alternative hotels for future visits and for us to recommend to others.
__label__0 Right at the Northern end of this legendary boulevard, access to the Gothic center, the best artisan and designer shopping plus the central produce market, is all within a ten-minute walk The hotel was mostly good.
__label__0 Every employee we encountered at the hotel was very friendly and helpful.
__label__0 the hotel has had a facelift,
__label__0 The service was second to none.....if you cant be pleased here than you cant be pleased anywhere.
__label__0 Perhaps our table was a bit on the boring side, but the cook didnt even ineract with us.
__label__0 That just topped it off.
__label__0 Would I stay again?
__label__0 We rented a couple of four wheeled dirt bikes and rode up the hillside and through a village.
__label__0 and windows open only part way.
__label__0 but two single mattresses had been pushed in
__label__1 If you're a non-smoker, don't stay here!
__label__0 We got around the problem of rooms by moving beds and putting some students in another hotel, which was paid for eventually by Studylink, but it made an unpleasant start to the visit.
__label__0 The desk staff are great but if you need anything special ask for Leonor who will go out of her way to get what you need.
__label__0 We thought it was really false advertising, since a diversity of restaurants was promised.
__label__0 We heard so many complaining during our stay and hope the took some time too to let them know.
__label__0 We never tried the mexican restaurant or the brazilBeverage ServiceFront Lobby bar - Very good in the night.
__label__0 old fashioned, but still my favorite...
__label__0 Although the Sutter lot does not allow in/out service, we used the savings to buy two, 24-hour muni bus/rail passes and a muni-map.
__label__0 I do not know what the quality of the rooms are like in the new part of the hotel.
__label__0 Upon the first request, we were told we would have to wait at least a half hour
__label__0 Also it was difficult to regulate the water
__label__0 Dont be surprised about this as alot of the nicer hotels around New Orleans does this.
__label__0 The room was a good size with ample space around the bed and a separate seating area.
__label__0 My new favorite hotel
__label__0 and timeliness of service was an issue as well.
__label__0 The staff were very helpful and always polite.
__label__0 Breakfest is average, It did have a good selection
__label__0 where is the lobby?
__label__0 Last but not least, no one said anything to me when I booked the room that there would not be any parking.
__label__1 you might want to bring ear plugs to protect you from your neighbor's late-night television, discussions, etc. I stayed there for business and then a few days being a tourist.
__label__0 You had to walk up a tiled step before getting into the tub
__label__0 The room was small
__label__0 working on fulfilling my New Year resolution to be more diligent about writing hotel reviews on tripadvisorWe stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in December 2006.
__label__0 While there are hotels closer in downtown,
__label__0 Save yourselves!!!!!
__label__0 the air conditioing did not work (left the balcony door wide open all night in March!), soft furnishings grubby, smelt unpleasant, the toilet broke (still not offered a change of room).
__label__0 I will be doing this ride each summer and staying at this motel.
__label__0 Once again beware the naked berliners (conservative Irish person speaking) in the park and also the mosquitos!
__label__0 However, when I went to get butter balls for my toast, a piece of glass about 1 inch square was commingled with the butter and landed on my toast.
__label__0 At least there you can get good service and a more confortable experience.
__label__0 My biggest problem with the room was that it was freezing.
__label__0 The location of this hotel was good, the subway station was not too far away.
__label__0 and My group went there instead.
__label__0 The hotel is in a great location
__label__0 As a Gold HHonors member, we received an upgraded room, which was very quiet, comfortable, and large, but had no view (windows open to an inner courtyard).
__label__0 The next evening we returned from the theatre to find the night manager at the front desk, with whom I had originally made the reservation.
__label__0 They were redecorated in May 05 - so carpets etc. all virtually new.
__label__0 We arrived only to stand in a line for 20 minutes before anyone told us since we were Royal Sevice Members we were to go to another area.
__label__0 For any time of normal demand, Id say that anything less than $120 would probably be a good value.
__label__0 There was a small roof top pool which we did not use.
__label__1 I would not recommend the restaurant either the food in not good quality
__label__0 The Benihana type restaurant was just a show with everything dumped onto a plate.
__label__0 The beach is too small, but what beach isnt in Waikiki.
__label__0 Although it was there error, they actually still refused to move us,
__label__0 Breakfast was tasteless.
__label__0 My single room has a huge bathroom and a balcony.
__label__0 The ocean was gorgeous, but rough, fellow tourists wonderful, and most staff were gracious--OUTSIDE the dining areas.
__label__0 At the hotel there are two restaurants available by reservation, we decided to reserve a table in the seafood restaurant; the menu was very limited and only contain one fish dish ,the other dishes were chicken or beef,.
__label__0 The front desk help ,Timothy, when we were there, was very helpful.
__label__0 The location is ideal, two minutes walk from the Sagrada Familia and the Linea 5 metro station.
__label__0 The suites were neat and well maintained.
__label__0 The part of the hotel that faces 4th smells of urine.
__label__0 The price was ok but after staying- I would expect that the rates should be lowered.
__label__0 The hotel is a few blocks removed from the noise and activity of Waikiki, so things are a little quieter.
__label__1 Although there are many choices, dont go with an expectation that you will be having a fine dining experience.
__label__0 Although there are a lot of coffee shops nearby, I decided to head to Pike Place Market and see what I could find there.
__label__0 Beautiful Stay Wonderful hotel, excellent location
__label__0 We asked at front desk and then said they would send someone up in 10 minutes, over 1 hour later no sign so we asked to move rooms.
__label__0 The opening of the new Pine Street tower and completion of the lobby renovations have added to the attractiveness of the hotel.
__label__0 The desk staff was exceptional.
__label__0 Directions from the hotel website were right on, check-in was completed in 30 seconds for a weekend stay.
__label__0 Total Disappointment...
__label__0 Excellent location only 2 blocks from Pike Place markets and transport.
__label__0 However, everything was functional, the price was not bad ($91 plus tax for two queens and a roll away),
__label__0 The only downfall of an inner room is that you cannot get fresh air through an open window.
__label__0 but no one ever came to bring me the glass of water.
__label__0 There were restaurants,Beverley Centre,laundrette, shops, all very close.
__label__1 Both places are highly recommended.
__label__0 Loved this hotel
__label__0 Arrived at the hotel at around 11:30am and asked for early check-in.
__label__0 The funny thing is,
__label__0 The front desk was extremely gracious at check in, offering shopping discount coupons and restaurant reservations.
__label__0 This makes it easy for frequent stops during your day, to drop off shopping, etc.
__label__0 The room was very much smaller than in the sister hotel,
__label__1 If youre heading to Tokyo, whether its business or pleasure, I definitely recommend the Okura. 70s kitsch, crap Scottish bar - its all good.
__label__0 Thats funny because I saw the maid in another room that had two beds not one bed and a pull out sofa.
__label__0 I had some febreeze so it was bearable.
__label__0 Everyone we encountered was extremely courteous and friendly.
__label__0 Massages - Massage huts all over the resort.
__label__0 We go to Seattle often,
__label__1 So if you are checking in and they allocate room 1238, make sure you have your own mirror.
__label__0 We arrived in our room and even though the hotel is smoke-free, I began wheezing from the mold.
__label__0 Upon arrival to our room we found a beautiful arrangement of towel figures upon our bed along with Good night spelled out in flowers.
__label__0 Breakfast was very good with a choice of cereal, various breads, ham, cheese, eggs, fruit salad, juice + a selection of teas and coffee.
__label__0 We had a 2-room suite in the south point, very close to their awesome water park River Ranch.
__label__0 The room ,a Romance Suite, was very spacious and near both the beach and pool.
__label__0 We had the front desk call a cab for us on our way out to dinner and were offered the hotel car and driver for our return.
__label__0 We parked in the Convention Centre lot for $24/night versus paying $35/night at the hotel.
__label__0 A trip down to reception to enquire as to whereabouts of saidremote-shrug of shoulders-our guests take them home you know set TV to CNN for duration of my stay.
__label__0 I read some negative reviews on here before our visit regarding the rooms - all our rooms were clean, spacious ,they accommodated an extra bed in double rooms to make things cheaper, the air conditioning worked and the windows opened.
__label__1 One more thing- if you want to visit the Bundestag it is a good idea to book a tour (in english) in advance.
__label__1 Dont go crazy worrying about fancy evening wear, pack as little as possible and bring a clip for the hair.
__label__0 towels looked like they were thrown on the hooks, dirty glasses not exchanged,
__label__0 Hotel extremely clean and everything extremely well manicured.
__label__0 However from the moment I pulled up I soon realized why it was so cheap.
__label__0 The lobby, the welcome cocktail, the rooms, the dining rooms; everything REALLY above average.
__label__0 If you came down late most of the food had gone and was not replenished.
__label__0 In fact, given that and the fact that you basically have to pay for everything in the hotel, including essentials like shampoo, gives the impression that every penny counts and making the guest feel at home comes last.
__label__0 This was our third time staying at the Sheraton Hotel in Downtown Seattle
__label__1 If you like quietness, as I do, ask for a room at the backside not fasing the street and higher up.
__label__0 I would go somewhere more unique.
__label__0 The receptionist told me that I could use the PCs in reception for free.
__label__0 How rude.
__label__0 but I am still disappointed that the hotel guest service is not as helpful as a 4-star hotel should be.
__label__0 The service was good overall, and breakfast we had was delivered on time and was very tasty.
__label__0 They were clean, comfortable and quiet.
__label__0 Just returned from Berlin, Germany and the Savoy Hotel was quite nice.
__label__0 There is also no air conditioning either
__label__0 My wife and I stayed here on a 2-night side trip from Napa.
__label__0 We also asked to be put in the new tower, as recommended by other people here.
__label__0 but you can't beat the location!
__label__0 I'm still raving about them.
__label__0 This hotel is in the French Quarter not far from Bourbon Str and you can definitely hear the music and noise.
__label__0 I have never had any problems,
__label__0 This time my wife came with me and agreed it was a great hotel: we had a Queen Andra Suite with 2 double beds, large desk, flatscreen TV, walk in wardrobe, minibar and plenty of space.
__label__0 Loved it An absolute gem of a hotel
__label__0 NYC in the summer
__label__0 We booked this hotel after reading several reviews as it seemed like the best deal when we compared the rates to the downtown hotels.
__label__0 Anything you could think of that's located off of I-5's "Downtown Exits" is a few blocks away, even Pike Place Market, great restaurants, music venues, shopping (including Nordstrom's flagship store)...ok, so why did I rate the hotel "Okay, but some problems"?
__label__0 Can one have a good time here and enjoy their stay as the resort is now?
__label__0 and the furniture is contemporary.
__label__0 The hotel is still new, so their bar wasnt open, but their sauna was great.
__label__0 This happened to me, the bill that the hamburger place was for 200 Dominican Pesos and they charged me $22 USD.
__label__0 Nothing was too much trouble.
__label__0 The hotel phone system was down for three days. Staff was rude.
__label__0 The location is a little more than a block to the MacPherson subway station.
__label__0 The view was pathetic, it was like a prison view, three concrete walls and the dirty roof top.
__label__0 The restaurant is temporarily located on the 41st floor in what was the fine-dining restaurant pre-Katrina.
__label__0 We will definitely return.
__label__0 but i found it clean.
__label__0 It was better and less expensive than the W Hotel, where I stayed a couple of years ago.
__label__1 Through the resort you can contact a guy named Angel for some of the best scuba diving I have ever done in my life.
__label__0 We will definately stay at our favouite Hawaiian hotel again.
__label__0 The staff was more mature  friendlier than the W. There's ample seating in the lobby to read the newspaper, an area of computers for guests, a takeout cafe/bakery and a restaurant/grill...from what I saw.
__label__0 Would I stay there again -- Maybe.
__label__0 Our room had a small chair that had a swing table on the arm and a foot rest that slid out, perfect for working on the laptop.
__label__0 We went out for a well earned drink and came back and we were actually given a family room on the 7th floor, nice view , but a very warm room, given that the weather was fab for the duration of our stay.
__label__0 Many rooms have a harbor view.
__label__0 If I had to go to Boston again, I may look elsewhere to stay.
__label__0 At first he told us to just turn the water valve off on the back of the toilet.
__label__0 Great value for Manhattan
__label__0 The bathroom here was spacious, but a disabled person (me) would have trouble with the very deep tall tub.
__label__0 We finally accepted our fate and reconciled to spend the night in the cell block.
__label__0 There is no elevator from the parking garage to the hotel.
__label__0 This swivelled about when turned on, making it difficult to stand under.
__label__1 Abit impersonal though, so if you are looking for a place remembering your name Conrad isnt the first place to look, on most important points it clearly delivers.
__label__1 Please remember to tip the staff.
__label__0 The service is first class.
__label__0 We were in room 711.
__label__0 No electricity means, no blended drinks, no AC, no light to see during the buffet breakfast,which there is only one of everyday,, no hot water, etc.
__label__0 With this in mind, it may sway us from visiting this property again, which is a great shame as otherwise our experience was faultless.
__label__0 and eventually got a table.
__label__0 The only minus is the additional costs.
__label__0 Overall, the Sheraton Seattle was OK.
__label__0 The room had its own temperature controls, so I was able to keep it a little on the cool side, which I prefer.
__label__0 My only negative is that the beds were too short.
__label__0 Inexpensive Boutique-like Hotel
__label__0 Our room was on the 4th floor, facing the street, we could open the window and look out.
__label__0 but he never returned my call.
__label__0 I then went to the front desk where a gentleman gave me, the guest, directions to housekeeping so that I could inquire on my behalf because he was too busy on the phone.
__label__0 I asked them why the room wasn't ready
__label__0 and one that had not been renovated.
__label__0 The rooms are a bit small for the price of the room.
__label__0 Breakfast was not included in our Expedia booking,
__label__0 We had to keep the air on high at the lowest temperature to make it comfortable.
__label__0 enjoy
__label__1 You can rent innertubes or floats ,about $10 for the day each,.
__label__0 The hotel management did not apologize or even offer an explanation...in fact the person at the front desk was rude.
__label__0 Hotel faces Piazza della Liberta.
__label__0 and dry cleaning was performed timely and skillfully.
__label__0 Exterior of hotel is very old and dated...I was worried when we drove up to check in.
__label__0 I think it was called Ginger.
__label__0 Otherwise: nice size rooms, good security, friendly staff, clean, and the employees were professional and friendly.
__label__0 but they were fully booked.
__label__0 At the Moore, you have it all at your doorstep.
__label__0 We paid extra for a "sweeping view of the city"
__label__0 We packed up all of our belongings again, called a cab, checked out (at 3:30am), and went to stay at the Holiday Inn Express.
__label__0 We had a king bed in our room and had plenty of space.
__label__0 A client of mine reserved the room and intended to pay for it.
__label__0 My room was well appointed.
__label__0 It takes about 45 minutes to get there from the Punta Cana airport.
__label__0 Pretzels and cookies under the bed.
__label__0 We travelled back to london on a Saturday evening.
__label__0 this won't ring your bell as all destinations will require at least a half hour walk or public transport journey.
__label__0 We had booked reservations at Sheraton in Hawaii prior to this experience.
__label__0 Not Im sorry or some other words of concern, just Oh.
__label__1 For those who are taking a cruise out of Seattle , like us, plan an extra day or two prior to your leaving and stay at the Andra (about 3 minutes form the debarkation dock) to compliment your trip.
__label__0 We felt very secure and safe here as well.
__label__0 Not exactly a gem
__label__0 We felt as though we shouldnt be asking ANY questions....We would still recommend this hotel
__label__0 All the employees there could not have done more or been nicer.
__label__0 After the receptionist put the phone down she then informed me that they did have a room afterall, but we could not check in after 2pm.
__label__0 Imagine the anger.
__label__0 My only minor complaint was that it was difficult to access the free internet.
__label__0 We especially liked the tortilla.
__label__0 Neighbourhood is dicey, but so is the whole of this area, no unpleasant encounters, though many homeless people.
__label__0 The location is really convenient to use any public transport (400m from Zoo Station)and two blocs away from KUFUDAMM.
__label__0 They also did not charge me for my 7 year old son
__label__0 The resort has a claimed ten restaurants open for dinner, with two of them requiring reservations.
__label__0 I must say that I was very impressed with the service at the hotel.
__label__0 What I had a problem with was the rooms had thin walls.
__label__0 Last two days in Germany so decided to push the boat out and book the *****, got a good price and most importantly the promise of a kingsize bed.
__label__0 while I was there.
__label__0 Nice food due to the French Chef on staff, but pricey.
__label__0 and only then did they find the reservation.
__label__0 My only complaint is street noise.
__label__0 The Warwick mats in the garage are filthy as are the stairwells.
__label__0 For a fee of course.
__label__0 This was the last place we stayed after 2 weeks in Germany
__label__0 The staff was very welcoming and helpful.
__label__0 Nice little hotel, friendly staff
__label__0 Adequate food, especially if youre not used to 3 or 4-star restaurants and perfer your food to look better than it tastes.
__label__0 I stayed at the Westin Grand this past weekend during my trip to Berlin to run the marathon.
__label__0 The only thing that would be better would be Oceanview.
__label__0 a/c worked exceedingly well and the maids were fantastic.
__label__0 I cant tell you how relaxing it was to soak in a hot tub and have the whole city of San Francisco below you
__label__0 we were constantly nickel-and-dimed.
__label__0 We booked through WestJet vacations and paid $1169 per person ,taxes in, for the trip.
__label__0 The hotels idea of compensasion was breakfast for two.
__label__0 I know it's a major city and it's downtown
__label__0 Not many places to eat, but there is a great market a block away.
__label__0 These statements indicated to us they did not care about what we thought once they had our money.
__label__0 The room had a very swampy odour when the air conditioning was turned off.
__label__1 Wonderful hotel but bring your ear plugs
__label__0 But we did not have one bad meal.
__label__0 Nothing spectacular.
__label__0 Very convenient.
__label__0 Breakfast, although continental was also quite good, particularly coffee which was excellent.
__label__0 I have long suspected that hotels reserve the smallest room, the one with the worst view, or the one by the elevator, for guests who pay a discounted rate ...
__label__0 Our room, on the Ocean, was, as was mentioned by others, not available until 4PM, which is the guaranteed check-in time.
__label__0 we were told that the hotel was full up.
__label__0 We were able to find seating without issue.
__label__0 Oh yeah, Donald Trump is building a couple hundred condos on the same property as the resort ,Dont worry, you dont even know the construction is going on, this place encompasses over 2000 acres,, and Trump also has two 18 hole golf courses ,PGA tour 2008-2011, on the property.
__label__0 San Gallo was a pleasant surprise in Florence.
__label__0 When I returned my main course in the restaurant because it was unacceptable (lobster the size of a prawn), they still expected me to pay for it.
__label__0 The room was large with a comfortable bed.
__label__0 We stayed only 1 night after a cruise with Carnival.
__label__0 Personally, I feel the best service the hotel provides is its complimentary meal and snack service throughout the day.
__label__0 You are treated as though you woke up that morning as Queen Elizabeth.
__label__0 the linens were of the cheapest quality.
__label__0 The bar and breakfast place looked like a snack vendor and the only staff is very practical.
__label__0 I am more of an open-window kinda person, that's why I requested a quiet room.
__label__0 Fifty dollars were added to my bill for items from the mini-bar which I did not order.
__label__0 We arrived at this hotel to meet with friends for a long weekend.
__label__0 It had a king sized bed, a separate day bed in the tv area and a huge bathroom with shower and separate jacuzzi tub.
__label__0 and so I went down to the bar that is just off the main lobby and asked for a glass of water.
__label__0 and we had to traipse all the way back to reception to be told that our three day booking had mistakenly been entered as two days - for this they did not apologise -
__label__0 It is family owned.
__label__0 A typical conference hotel.
__label__0 The only thing even slightly disapointing was the view, ,of some old buildings,, but you cant have everything.
__label__0 The main issue with the hotel is it's 5 star status.
__label__0 Again, my husband walked, glasses in hand, and poured orange juice several times..
__label__0 The hotel is a 20 minute bus ride from the airport.
__label__0 Now: I had been told to check in early
__label__0 It is basically across the street from the convention center - perfect it you are attending a conference.
__label__0 Fabulous Hotel I just got back from an overnight stay at this hotel and
__label__0 The Pulitzer exceeded our expectations.
__label__0 and 200 bus routes which pass all the major tourist sites - a far better option than taking a tourist bus.
__label__0 We came there expecting to dive onsite, not have to drive 30 minutes to a dive shop that may or may not be reputable.
__label__0 If you like luxury, you may be disappointed, but was lucky enough to get a room with a waterfront view
__label__0 However, room smelled like wet-dog a bit.
__label__0 ,4, the hotel restaurant had a separate area where we could avoid the 15 euro breakfast in the morning and just have a reasonably priced ,and delicious, caffe con leche and pastry.
__label__0 Finally, the use of a town car for a slightly higher fee than a taxi was an excellent touch.
__label__0 The grounds were beautiful, but we noticed some cups in several common areas.... and these same cups remained until the date of our departure.
__label__0 and subsequently read some reviews about construction noise so had some concerns.
__label__0 Both check ins were smooth, staff lovely, room was great.
__label__0 You may wait for your luggage, or for any special requests like a replaced lightbulb.
__label__0 We received a very fair rate
__label__0 No welcome drink or greeting upon arrival.
__label__0 We enjoyed the location of the hotel, no doubt.
__label__0 Yes, the room is small.
__label__0 get to the pool early to reserve a spot
__label__0 no problem-park on the street for free-after 6 pmand Sunday all day free.
__label__0 Altough we had a balcony over the street it was very quiet at night.
__label__0 The room has a shower AND a bath tub.
__label__0 Nice size room for 2.
__label__0 Recommended.
__label__0 Just got back from a three-night stay at The Rex and its only fair to sing this hotels praises.
__label__0 Ruth Chris is also the hotels main restauraunt and bar.
__label__0 The hotel is ideally located.
__label__0 Some other rooms appeared a bit better in terms of size and view, but overall we were very happy with the Laovisier and would stay there again.
__label__0 It was a very nice, clean hotel.
__label__0 I'd give it a better rating if there wasn't so many errors with the bill and checkin, but they seem to be trying
__label__0 The traffic noise was a little better a few floors up,
__label__0 The decor is in muted tones and interesting textures.
__label__1 They offer handicapped accessible rooms which are more spacious and located at the enterior of the hotel ,which I would recommend as those staying with rooms facing the streets often complain of the noise,.
__label__0 That was a bid frustrating, but luckily we had the passport.
__label__0 Room: Very clean, still had a newly built smell and feel to it, which was nice.
__label__0 U-bahn station directly in front of hotel for easy transport to attractions farther west.
__label__0 Free wifi in the lobby but you have to pay for it in the room.
__label__0 We were very impressed with the facilities and the people.
__label__0 Absolutely Beautiful
__label__0 Also, as it's near the Zoo rail station and the windows are not double-paned you will here trains all the time.
__label__0 Had the pleasure of visiting Berlin for a city break in September.
__label__0 As there were no twins available I had originally booked a standard double in the historic building but was shown to a standard queen room instead.
__label__0 However, the room is styled so nicely and sexy that its not even noticed.
__label__0 Staff: These people are the hardest workers I have ever seen.
__label__0 and this was the worst hotel experience I have ever had.
__label__0 If the price was right and only in a double room.
__label__0 Location wise the hotel is great but during the night the side streets were a little daunting and saw a girl get her bag snatched 
__label__0 The location of the hotel is very central--and I look forward to my next stay at the Ritz-Carlton Phoenix.
__label__0 But the place where you rest your head at the end of your vacation day should bring you peace.
__label__0 This hotel was picked by a friend for location and comfort.
__label__0 This was a decent vantage point and was obviously a safe and quiet neighborhood.
__label__0 The resort was right on the beach lots of palm Trees very tropical, we always had good service at the restaurants; the best and most friendly restaurant was the Mexican.
__label__0 We liked the grilled foods the best- chicken, lobster, steak and the chips and salsa.
__label__0 Booked through the hotel website.
__label__0 The second day, I left the tip and checked out at around noon.
__label__0 The snorkeling in front of the Bavaro was very good and snorkel equipment was free for one hour each day.
__label__0 Even if you do not have an ocean-view or poolside room, you are still surrounded by such beautiful gardens and fountains.
__label__0 She was always smiling, and ready with any questions.
__label__0 It is all over the city and you will defintely catch the fever
__label__0 The person I spoke to was pleasant and stated they could not guarantee these requests would be honored but would make a note on the reservation.
__label__0 Holiday Inn Express has better service.
__label__0 This hotel had a knowledgeable, professional and friendly staff - their recommendations of a Chinese restaurant in nearby Chinatown or of a restaurant in close North Beach were spot-on when I made clear my price range and my expectations.
__label__0 When we got to the bottom of the staircase leading to check-in the bellman could not have been nicer.
__label__0 The new room (554) at least had a double bed (but alas still two tiny duvets)
__label__0 and great for shopping and the linens and bed were very comfortable.
__label__0 I checked and double checked, and called Marriotts Platinum desk and asked them to verify that no mention was made.
__label__1 If you expect 5 star service then dont leave your country where you have all the modern facilities.
__label__1 Our Classic room was a bit small and you might consider upgrading to a larger room if you are staying for very long.
__label__0 The internet access is like a small telephone box with no seat.
__label__0 I am a beach person and I was disappointed.
__label__0 We returned at 6 p.m. to be told that because of increased business,
__label__0 There is also jet skiing, snorkeling, etc.
__label__0 and when we asked the next day to be moved to a room with either twins or a decent-sized bed,
__label__0 but my husband did.
__label__0 Its an easy walk to all sightseeing attractions ,five blocks from the waterfront, and there is a free bus in Seattle but we could never figure out how that worked ,do some research before you go,.
__label__0 Were a family of four and stayed in their quad room for 2 nights in June.
__label__0 A colleague and myself stayed at 1898 at the beginning of July for a work trip.
__label__0 we've been getting passed from manager to manager and department to department and we have to repeat our story and prove ourselves over and over again, despite being promised that it will be fixed immediately--I promise.
__label__0 Our room was decorated with love birds made of towels and we received a small bottle of room.
__label__0 We could not hear a peep from other guests through the walls or hallways.
__label__0 Even with that knowledge the place is so beautiful and they are so nice, I want to go back as soon as possible.
__label__0 Stunning and refreshing
__label__0 Complimentary bottles of water and chocolates daily was good
__label__0 At check-in, the person at the desk was very rude, said there were no special request noted on our reservation card andstated there were no king beds
__label__0 Problem #3 At about 9:45am housekeeper enter my room while I was in bed.
__label__0 and so i was moved.
__label__1 The hotel decor is very tasteful and trendy, and while the wallpaper may need a tiny bit of work here and there, as has been mentioned before, its really not a big deal.
__label__0 However, the best part is the care you receive from Fabrizio and Tommaso from the moment you book the reservation and ask for touring help, to check in and out, to dinner and musuem reservations while you are there.
__label__1 Crown Plaza is fine, but beware of parking prices
__label__0 There was intermittent construction noise throughout the hotel.
__label__0 We will absolutely stay there again if we get back to Florence one day.
__label__0 Easyjet probably blame groundstaff.
__label__0 This appeals to me but might not be everyones taste.
__label__0 She took it upon herself to escort me to the front desk for a room change.
__label__0 I didnt feel that I was treated any differently or missed out on anything.
__label__0 Was pleasantly surprised by the room-spacious,and clean.
__label__0 I had to stand next to my room door to get a halfway decent signal - at the desk there was almost no signal.
__label__0 I turned up the thermostat, but it didn't help.
__label__0 If you havent cruised before, then youd probably think the food was pretty good.
__label__0 Our neighbors phone rang and we could here his conversation, and the toilets flushing.
__label__0 The room we got was nothing special, small, clean, thats it.
__label__0 The bed was very comfortable and the even with the 2 walls of glass, the room darkeners kept in pitch black.
__label__0 If you don't mind spending a little, it's a great stay.
__label__0 We came in very late, but our room was ready and it took less than two minutes to check-in.
__label__0 Starting from the first minute of our stay, hotel personnel didn`t make us feel like a guest but more like an intruder.
__label__0 The hotel staff was very helpful and we felt very welcome at the hotel.
__label__0 and the rooms were of average size.
__label__0 We swam with sharks and sting rays.
__label__0 May be the restaurant have something,
__label__0 My husband and myself enjoyed this wonderful resort from July 19 thru July 28th.
__label__0 Another thing is that the cleaning lady just walked into my room on the morning of my last day.
__label__0 The wife of the hotel owner also speaks very good english.
__label__0 ANTI-HISTAMINE MEDICATION / CREAM.
__label__0 We would definately recommend it.
__label__0 The night we returned our rental two gentlemen in a Lincoln suffered the same fate.
__label__0 Maybe that is why there is a discount.
__label__1 The location is perfect and I highly recommend the spa at the attached LA sports Club.
__label__0 and that there was to be no room there for our first night.
__label__0 The towels and sheets were threadbare.
__label__0 Rene Wildeman replied immediately and the reservations department got back to me letting me know they would try to put us together, and then offered us an upgrade for $31 per night per room.
__label__0 I am from middle class america and I was very satisfied.
__label__0 From the moment we pulled up front ,valet quickly greeted us, as parking was part of our $175/night rate, we experienced a very high level of service.
__label__0 I know that sounds crazy but even the mixer were a little odd.
__label__0 It was a good choice for placing the lobby, as we didnt have to walk through crowds to get to our room.
__label__0 He was the most hospitable of all the staff.
__label__0 Room was very basic with the same features of the old Appt Berlin Hotel.
__label__0 We later learned that someone else had wanted the room for the whole weekend,
__label__0 I would avoid this place and wait till the new tower is build.
__label__1 So I would recommend that if you reserve a room here and cancel SAVE YOUR CANCELATION NUMBER
__label__0 In reality, rooms look different!
__label__0 Its a short stroll to the best yum cha in Australia.
__label__0 The dining room had a six seating table, the living room had several wicker chairs w/ cushions a nice sofa and a full sized bed that you pulled out of the wall.
__label__0 We tipped everywhere, but still received poor service.
__label__0 On the day of our return, with time on our hands, we decided to take the train to the airport and were advised by the bell captain to go via Bundes Platz to Schoenefeld.
__label__0 An experience of a lifetime
__label__0 Upon arrival at the Marriott, I knew things were not going to be so swell.
__label__0 After a brief chat with the people at the front desk about our anniversary / birthday celebration we left for dinner.
__label__0 We had two rooms, the larger room had a stunning bay view.
__label__0 We had already researched the Copamarina and felt very confident that this is a solid dive shop with a good reputation, however we did not know anything about the dive shop that is 30 minutes away.
__label__0 Only a block away from a laundromat.
__label__0 My wife and I stayed at Casa Alta Vista for 2 nights in December.
__label__0 Nor is the hotel filthy or a wreck as some of the reviewers have stated.
__label__0 This is most definately a RELAXING vacation, which I found to be a bit difficult to do at times.
__label__0 Also the location is excellent - right next to the SBahn, 10 minutes from the Reichstag on foot.
__label__0 When we arrived we were impressed by the lobby and the friendly staff.
__label__0 This was disturbing because the guest had reservations and were there for a wedding but for some reason there was no room.
__label__0 Barcelona over the net.
__label__0 The location, as already mentioned, is great because of all the shops and restaurants within a few blocks.
__label__0 Overall we had a good experience.
__label__0 They were not unfriendly either,
__label__0 the maid cleaning the room will be nice enough to turn it in.
__label__0 Its San Francisco, how much time do you really expect to spend in the room??
__label__0 Our room was not large but nicely decorated and very sunny with a good sized bay window looking out onto Geary Street.
__label__0 Nice breakfast, although the breakfast room is quite crowded.
__label__0 I stayed at the Westin in mid september after having stayed there in 2005.
__label__0 Great Location for the Price
__label__0 The hotel should give a password out to guests that check-in or at least program a time-out to avoid this frustrating situation.
__label__0 HotelConnect, mainly based on the many great reviews here.
__label__0 If we tried to speak spanish to them, they tried to speak English to us.
__label__0 My only complaint is the jaccuzi was out of service and being worked on in the pool area (which is in the basement),
__label__0 The bed was very comfy.
__label__1 Go to Spa Aria at tehhOtel MOnteleone...wonderful services there Eat at Muriels and Tommys You wont be disappointed
__label__0 The walls are covered in cream striped fabric, and there are very beautiful wall lights and table lamps.
__label__0 We checked the bathroom and it also had black mold growing in the 1x1 tiles.
__label__0 It done its job but didn't make you want to refill your plate a second time.
__label__0 and further upo the same street towards the synagogue direction.
__label__0 The Savoy is a very nice hotel with antique furniture but still a kind of trendy look.
__label__0 No complaints, hotel served its purpose admirably.
__label__0 he sent us to the right suburb but the wrong street,
__label__0 I stayed there on business for 4 nights in early June.
__label__0 Turn around immediately and return to the front desk, where you will be charged an extra 30 Euros per night for a "renovated" room that, upon inspection, hasn't been renovated anytime in recent memory, but is at least cleaner and does not smell.
__label__0 Still quite bearable from the Sheraton and my son thought running through all the snow was a blast.
__label__0 We found the staff at the hotel charming and helpful, and the accommodation very good.
__label__0 Great hotel.
__label__1 Hotel is down some side streets 5 minute walk away from the main street of La Rambla with its metro stop of Liceu - so you are within easy reach of the rest of the City via the metro.
__label__0 The buffets were the about the usual.
__label__0 Overall, you could do a lot worse than to go to the Berlin Hilton as the location is absolutely spot on for the underground,
__label__0 That being said, there are some areas that will exceed your expectations.
__label__0 Lola onsite is good,
__label__1 Alcohol was top shelf - try a vodka lime juice
__label__0 This was actually not too big of a deal.
__label__0 and I asked them why should I take points for a hotel that was satisfied with such a low level of service
__label__0 I usually stay at the Moore a couple times a year, without any problems.
__label__1 However, if you avoid the second floor rooms and don't mind a little construction noise,
__label__0 I decided it offered the best value for money for what I was after and I wasnt to be disappointed.
__label__0 While not bad, it certainly lacks many of the finer qualities of the areas better establishments ,Four Seasons, Phoenician, Fairmont Scottsdale Princess,.
__label__0 Expensive though, but it is supposedly the best Chinese restaurant in Japan.
__label__1 However, be prepared that most restaurants and hotels are working at half of their usual staff since Katrina.
__label__0 This hotel is badly in need of a manager who knows what is going on in the place.
__label__0 This hotel was within walking distance to most attractions (the Space Needle has a monorail a couple of blocks away)
__label__0 we did not get our coffee,
__label__0 They didn't even offer to have someone carry my suitcases up the stairs.
__label__0 When it was under the old name of Ocean Beach, it was considered a three star.
__label__0 The room was a reasonable size, and the bathroom was quite large compared to our other stays.
__label__0 The hotel can be reached from Tegel Airport by catching the X9 or slower 109 bus and getting off at the last stop (Zoologischer S+U Bahn).
__label__0 Also, construction on the street starts at about 6:30 AM so forget about sleeping in.
__label__0 Our room was a standard size business room, with a nice view towards a park and the Nikolaikirche.
__label__0 Very comfortable bed, lovely furnishings, really large wardrobe, nice ammenties.
__label__0 I cant imagine a more beautiful resort or more helpful staff.
__label__0 Overall, the room was worth the price.
__label__1 Make no mistake - the Moore is pretty much a dump.
__label__0 Some were complaining about not getting the room they were promised, along with others.
__label__0 resturant was ok.
__label__0 Good hotel - good position
__label__0 The hotel has completed $70 million in renovations, and it shows.
__label__0 First it is true that the hotel is about 10min by car from the central station and the building looks terrible from the outside ,used to be an old hospital,.
__label__0 Over thirty dollars a day for parking.
__label__0 and consequently arose an hour late.
__label__0 You will just have to try it for yourself.
__label__0 Henry Newmann was at the bag check and immediately found us a room and got our keys.
__label__0 The hotel was very empty
__label__0 The single room I had was very small with a sloping roof and despite only having a small single bed, there wasn't even room for for a desk.
__label__0 A friend had recommended the Queen based on a stay from several years before.
__label__0 Its not true to say that it hasnt been renovated, though.
__label__0 Outstanding
__label__0 We tipped $5 per person.
__label__0 From the moment we stepped out of our car to the moment we departed, the service was excellent.
__label__0 I wore earplugs but still had trouble getting any sleep.
__label__0 Since the pod shower only works when it is closed, it is not possible to get warm water flowing before you step into the pod.
__label__0 I disagree with some of the reviews i have read on tripadvisor re this hotel.
__label__0 The walls are a little thin, though, so if you're a light sleeper,
__label__0 The flight went to Girona, so we got the bus to the station and you could see the hotel from the entrance, only 2 mins walk.
__label__0 I had my bag opened by a pick pocket within 5 minutes of arriving at the bus station - it was only luck that she did not get anything out of my bag - Having said that Barcelona is wonderful - dont let it spoil your stay but be careful
__label__0 and I think they never changed the towels.
__label__0 This is definitely a four star hotel as noted in China ,trip advisor lists it as a 3 star,.
__label__0 I accept, however, that we had a balcony and a great view unto the Unter den Linden, but that was it.
__label__0 The room cleaning was questionable though as they did not remove empty water bottles the whole time we stayed.
__label__0 we walked down to Pike market, walked over and caught the monorail to the Space Needle.
__label__0 The room was large, nothing special about the bathroom,
__label__0 After 20 minutes the desk person said, that must have been a duplicate message
__label__0 When I first started visiting, the neighborhood was in desperate need of police surveillance at night.
__label__0 The room was not very big
__label__0 Its really one of the nicest hotels anywhere and the best airport hotel.
__label__0 and I had to check 4 times before it was available.
__label__0 We ordered hamburgers once but the meat looked pink even after it was cooked twice.
__label__0 Totally unacceptable as a lone female.
__label__0 Room smelt of smoke when 'no smoking' requested.
__label__0 Otherwise, it was nicely decorated and cozy.
__label__0 We must have just been unlucky with our experience of Paris, because what should have been a lovely time was ruined by at least 3 encounters of very rude Parisians and very expensive prices.
__label__0 The fridge door became unhinged as soon as I opened it.
__label__0 I thought it was a VERY quite hotel, but again we stayed on the 19th Floor.
__label__0 One very unpleasant experience in both the restaurant and the lobby bar area was the mass of fruit flies that became a constant and annoying nuisance.
__label__0 they were a bit cold to me (some may like this).
__label__1 so I really highly recommend.
__label__0 I think it just may be a sewage problem in that neighborhood of Florence.
__label__0 Not a bad choice, but I wonder if we could have done a bit better...
__label__0 The location, however, cant be beat.
__label__0 Our room was adequate if a little small but was clean and well presented.
__label__0 The only meal is breakfast and we tended to go out for that - cheaper
__label__0 Location is perfect for RLD, Teasers is a lively bar just down the road, also Tara ,good Irish bar, further down on Rokin.
__label__0 In no way do I mean any disrespect to anybody, and if anybody fells disrespected, I apoligize from the bottom of my heart.
__label__0 Punta Cana was pretty, but no better thappreciate tourism.
__label__0 You dont have to ask for anything, some how the staff seems to understand what you need and they do cartwheels to make you happy.
__label__0 The first night we woke up at midnight because the people were talking and when they sneezed at 6:00 am it was so loud I thought someone was in our room.
__label__0 The hotel itself is small and older but the staff makes up for it.
__label__0 Thoroughly modern, great views ,we were on the 31st floor,.
__label__0 I called to see what type of room we would be receiving
__label__0 They finally moved us to another room.
__label__0 The hotel is very centrally situated and has a wow factor in the reception atrium with its awe-inspiring aquadrome.
__label__0 I would recommend to others traveling on a budget.
__label__0 Travel for some distance in Berlin is unavoidable since it is so spread out,
__label__0 We booked this trip through cheapcaribbean.com
__label__0 There is even a Trader Joes market nearby and we got some microwaveable stuff for dinner one night and saved a TON of money.
__label__0 Everyone assoctated with this place thought their you know what didnt stink.
__label__0 Breakfast was very average  waiting staff very average - on the plus side Berlin was amazing the restaurant across the road from the Mark Hotel - The Meineke Restaurant was lovely both food wise  staff wise  there was a little bar on the same side of the road as the hotel but near to Kurfurstendamm str can't remember the name
__label__0 Clean, good location --but noisy
__label__0 So I contacted Hotel Connect ,who we made our booking with - fantastic company, to ask what was happening with our booking, she promptly phoned the hotel, we could hear the conversation as we were sat in the lobby - quite funny really.
__label__0 The result: employees who are exhausted and dont care.
__label__0 It is a wonderful hotel in a perfect location to explore Boston.
__label__1 Some suggestions for those going for a long weekend trip .... Book the Beantown Trolley Tour.
__label__0 We had booked as part of a group for three nights from Thursday
__label__0 I'm not sure that I follow that logic, but whatever.) After our overseas flight we really didn't feel like arguing, so we just paid the extra - no way to say now if the other room in the same grade would have been acceptable.
__label__0 We recently had a wonderful overnight at the Warwick.
__label__0 Check out time is noon, and since my flight was not until 10 p.m. that night, they let me store my suitcase in their luggage storage room.
__label__0 Hotel is really superclean, very nice and the helpful staff is very friendly.
__label__0 there are a couple of luggage carts that you can wheel your stuff about.
__label__0 While not bad for families looking to save a little, it is not the luxurious resort for which it bills itself.
__label__0 but when we turned on the fan it was even louder
__label__0 The third night, same deal, no top sheet on the bed.
__label__0 Hotel staff provided prompt and courteous service to address our every need.
__label__0 Read these messages, others have posted similar fraudulent charges to their credit cards.
__label__0 I gave up.
__label__0 Our room was dark due to subdued lighting and a small window, but to be fair I did ask for a quiet room.
__label__0 The hotel's cleanliness is superb.
__label__0 Friendly service great location
__label__0 We spent most of our time sightseeing and found the convenience of getting to and from the hotel ideal.
__label__0 and they sold my room.
__label__0 I travel for a living
__label__0 Anyway they sent me off to look at another room which was equally as poor.
__label__0 Let's have a round of applause, please, for the Westin Grand, for taking discount bookings to a new low.
__label__0 I would stay there again at deal rates but would probably ask for new tower to hopefully avoid odor which was not offensive enough to change rooms but a little yucky!
__label__0 Our room had air conditioning, a small tv in the closet, hair dryer, and a small desk with chair.
__label__0 Check in was a breeze, less than 5 minutes.
__label__0 Each night there was no more than three choices of places to eat.
__label__0 Marble bathrooms have deep soaking tubs,a shower that has a floor to celing glass door with 2 shower heads ,rain shower above, telephone shower mid-range, and a thermostat controlled steamer, allowing you to set time and temp
__label__0 The CD cube bedside clock/alarm, the metal mesh chairs and the cute one cup at a time fast coffee brewer all met with her approval.
__label__0 Great Hotel in Good Location
__label__1 La Luna could dampen this noise significantly if they were to seal the door so that it fits better in the door frame.
__label__0 We stayed at the Davanzati the last weekend in August.
__label__0 They also have a business center with 2 computers with internet access and a printer (free use of all when I was there).
__label__0 Valet parking is $35 a night,
__label__0 and the food was average.
__label__0 I wish we could have stayed longer and unfortunately it was the first hotel of a 5 city german trip so I will have to compare every hotel to this one.
__label__0 On the other hand, the cots were comfortable and the room, strange as it looked, was bigger than a regular room.
__label__0 Also it really doesnt matter where your room is located, each section has its benefits.
__label__0 Everyone here seem to enjoy their work and it shows.
__label__0 These were not of a great monitory value, but spoilt what was overall a very good experience.
__label__0 This time the lights did not work and the remote control had to be replaced.
__label__0 Instead, they push very expensive courses requiring extra transportation costs.
__label__0 There was however, no coffee maker.
__label__0 and there are always some people inside smoking cuban cigars which makes the air inside unbearable.
__label__0 The room was very clean, bed very comfy and free wired internet access.
__label__1 Please do not be fooled by the pictures on the internet - If you book this hotel, please expect an 'Allocation on Arrival' service as you will have no idea where you will be placed.
__label__0 Entertainment was provided by the Gondoliers based at the Gondola station right outside the notel, their banter is wonderful to watch.
__label__0 So refreshing.
__label__0 Stayed three nights at Sofitel last week.
__label__0 The front desk was always polite as well as effieicent.
__label__0 The rest of the hotel needs a lot of work.
__label__0 The lobby is beautiful....we checked in and once in our room realized it was cold.
__label__0 We had done significant research on hotels in Oahu and I can say after seeing all the other locations we considered such as Sheraton Moana Surfrider, Marriot Waikiki and many others we were thrilled with our decision to stay at HHV.
__label__0 What's so great about the Moore that I've visited and revisited and been a fan for nearly a decade now...
__label__0 The water was a tropical blue with darker shading over the coral reefs.
__label__0 The people who run this inn are very helpful, friendly, and resourceful.
__label__0 So, some of the poorest service I have ever experienced, misleading advertising, surly/miserable/rude staff and awful public areas.
__label__0 and the hotel is in a great area of town.
__label__0 and this is where my case was kept.
__label__0 Upon finding out my shower didnt work, the indifferent staff gave me a new room after only 10 min of arguing, which was nice.
__label__0 it had the look of a Young Hostel.
__label__0 The staff was professional and polite,
__label__0 And the concierge was extremely helpful.
__label__0 The reception staff and all the waiting/bar staff were extremely helpful and friendly.
__label__0 It wasn't true but it was quite embarrassing
__label__0 The room was comfortable with a great view of Los Angeles.
__label__0 We had a great time.
__label__0 I was supposed to stay at this hotel on Canal Street for 3 nights at the end of June using a coupon for one of them.
__label__0 The small, basic rooms are made up for by the great location and roof top views.
__label__1 Also this is a safer area than say- Sol and the Gran Via-where I saw an attempt at pic-pocketing etc at night time.
__label__0 I did require a doctor whilst there as I had forgot to pack some cruical medication that was available on prescription only.
__label__0 This type of thing simply should not be allowed to happen.
__label__0 also 5 minutes walk is Ka De We which is the 2nd the biggest department store in Europe after Harrods.
__label__0 There is no fruit complementary despite some website say it is provided.
__label__0 but that they had moved the Ginger Bread houses to another location entirely (an imprortant fact that they forgot to mention when we were calling to confirm that the Ginger Bread houses were indeed going to be there).
__label__0 When we arrived, we climbed the flight of stairs with 100 plus lbs of luggage.
__label__0 My husband and I, along with some friends, just returned from the Majestic Colonial.
__label__0 Its tough to find the positives after getting so upset about this vacation.
__label__0 Keep in mind, they are trying their best but in the end it is still a budget hotel.
__label__0 And quietness is worth something I think:-,
__label__0 The hotels grounds are immaculate.
__label__0 Evidently they recently renovated and were unaware that in terms of noise, it was like sharing a room with your flooormate.
__label__0 I especially want to note the cleaning crew, who took the time to acknowledge us with a pleasant and sincere hello or good morning each time we passed.
__label__0 The water is warm but fairly murky....not nearly as nice as the beaches is Cuba but still goregous.
__label__0 I know that leaving something behind is my mistake,
__label__0 The hotel is a great building.
__label__0 The weather was really tropical and sunny.
__label__0 There is a minibar, a TV and a/c.-The neighbourhood is very french, the two metro lines Nr. 7 and 10 very convenient.
__label__0 Their attitude was shockingly bad
__label__0 We brought our bikes and biked downtown, which took about an hour each way on some nice paths.
__label__0 Nice view of Diamond Head and the movie screen on the beach.
__label__0 All of our requests were accommodated ,high floor, refrigerator, extra towels, etc.,
__label__0 or at least attempted to.
__label__0 The elevators where constantly out of service while filled at capacity due to the convention.
__label__0 It was very difficult to obtain a reservation to dine at the a la carte restaurants.
__label__0 I still dont know how we got it but it was wonderful..
__label__0 Shower area was small though and door didnt fit so the floor got wet
__label__0 For breakfast we ate at the market (lots of options)
__label__0 The room was very small.
__label__0 I was concerned about this, but it wasn't an issue.
__label__0 Parked right across the road in a place offering a spot for only $5-had to move my car that night to see De La Hoya/Mayweather fight at local sports pub-on return garage was full-now what ?
__label__0 Well located and nice rooms but too noisy!!!
__label__0 The beds are rather hard.
__label__0 Is a remodel in the future?
__label__0 Cleaner and safer area.
__label__0 The bed was quite high
__label__0 What an AMAZING resort
__label__0 and we were all happy with the value for money and service.
__label__0 and the mini poinsettia and tin of chocolates made us smile.
__label__0 Recently renovated hotel is in a great location for walking to museums and shopping in an interesting gentrifying section of East Berlin.
__label__0 had to bust open windows after room was cleaned, too far and ugly to walk to Chinatown or North Beach ,they suggest that you walk through this filthy long tunnel to get there and if you dont its longer ,and just as un-scenic,, super noisy
__label__0 So overall, no complaints, it is a very good hotel.
__label__0 It was also in a great location for all the hot Manhattan Night Clubs.
__label__0 The staff were marvellous - very friendly and helpful - can also endorse the review regarding bell boy desk - they were a laugh a minute and everybody loves British football
__label__0 I was told to Sit down
__label__0 The taxi driver could not pull up to the curb due to construction materials in the street.
__label__0 A tiny desk was provided which contained a coffee maker, the ice bucket ,along with a few drinks that were for sale, and was also meant to be used as a work space.
__label__0 All in all, not bad for the convenience.
__label__0 One poor bellman for the hotel the whole time we were there.
__label__0 After reading all of the negative reviews, I took a chance anyway and was very pleased.
__label__0 Had we not been told in advance how wonderful our stay would be because of the Heavenly Beds,
__label__0 Awesome coffee shop you have to try too.
__label__1 So, if you ever have a bad experience at this hotel and they promise you something, you better get it in writing because Joanna Turmo will not come to the phone.
__label__0 My wife and I stayed at the Coral Princess Inn for 3 days during October.
__label__0 Our room was small, but very clean and had a nice high ceiling and a safe.
__label__0 None of the other facilites were opened but it didnt matter because you have everything you needed within walking distance.
__label__0 We had a room upgrade and a variety of gifts, free dinner, etc, to apologise for our inconvenience.
__label__0 but as it has lots of stairs
__label__0 It was a bit small compared to other resorts Ive stayed at in Cuba and Mexico, but the water was pristine.
__label__0 the location was great!
__label__0 There are good coffee bars and restaurants nearby.
__label__0 The internet was free but I do think people should only be allowed say 30 mins and its written in a book, thats a fair way I think.
__label__0 I will be telling all of my friends about the Gardens.
__label__0 The staff was helpful
__label__0 and the cold air just poured in from the bottom seal of the patio window.
__label__0 Will return, in all likellihood.
__label__0 The stay was very comfortable and the room [small but ample] clean.
__label__0 Our room ,1717, had a great view of the bay, Coit tower and the St. Peter Paul Church Spires.
__label__0 Plenty of shopping and restaurant nearby.
__label__1 AS A MATTER OF FACT, AVOID ALL SECRETS RESORTS, AS THEY ARE BUILDING WITHIN PLAYA DEL CARMEN, AND HAVE OTHER RESORTS.
__label__0 The Bavaro safari runner trip into the countryside will open your eyes as to how good you have it.
__label__0 There where a lot of closets, but I didn't need them as I was only there for a short stay.
__label__0 It was a perfect location, allowing us to get out quickly to see the sights, and make easy visits back for a rest or to freshen up.
__label__0 The first room we were taken to had only a shower, and barely enough room to set down our bags.
__label__0 The view of the ocean and Palomino Island was breathtaking.
__label__0 sort of reminded me of a works canteen but that aside,
__label__0 Check in was fast and curtious.
__label__0 We couldn't believe all the previous excellent tripadvisor reports!
__label__0 A Beautiful Deal
__label__0 and the hotel is close to the more interesting neighborhoods of Schoneberg and Kreuzberg (maps are deceptive these areas are easily in safe walking distance of the hotel even though they appeared to be further away)Overall this hotel is fine for a basic safe modern hotel
__label__1 However, there is a good advantage to this hotel if you have a car.
__label__0 Breakfast is great.
__label__0 During the rest of the day, you can also get complimentary water, coffee, tea, milk and cookies in the same area of the lobby.
__label__0 My husband was attending a conference at the hotel
__label__0 Our room was clean
__label__0 In the end, they helped me find another room for one night nearby ,at perhaps the worst hotel Ive stayed at in twenty years, and then gave me a room upgrade for the remaining night.
__label__0 No map, no directions and no further offer of assistance.
__label__0 The hotel is a bit older (like most in Seattle)
__label__0 There were underground stations five minutes away ,Victoria and Pimlico, but the bus was better and not so crowded.
__label__0 The staff and very helpful.
__label__0 There is a restaurant and a bar at the hotel, but I didn't visit either.
__label__0 and also used the shuttle to get to the airport.
__label__0 and the location cannot be beat.
__label__0 Go with an open mind, relax, and you will have an absolutely great time.
__label__0 We had great views over the East River and over Midtown as well.
__label__0 Parking is $21/day which is pretty steep
__label__0 Our perfect hotel is one that offers a central location to the attractions we want to see - with spacious, comfortable rooms and good service.
__label__0 We did all three during our stay.
__label__1 Go somewhere with better service.
__label__0 We called for our luggage ,take yours up yourself, and they said five to ten minutes.
__label__0 Its a little on the pricey side, but you definitely get what you pay for
__label__0 Didn't get it...
__label__0 If you are young and single you are probably going to want to go off the resort for the clubs.
__label__0 The only good thing was the location.
__label__0 it was very drab.
__label__0 The big chains and their attempt to instill some americana into Japan result in a dilution of the excellent Japanese service ethic, which as visitors will know, is out of this world, but very rule-bound.
__label__0 On the plus side, the location was great.
__label__0 1st impression were great of the hotel,
__label__0 If we had been informed about the renovations at the Gran Flamenco when we were making our reservation, we would have chosen a different property.
__label__0 and the furniture was beautiful and well-made,
__label__1 Make sure you bring plenty of sun tan lotion-very expensive in the gift shop.
__label__0 We read about a musty smell in the rooms.
__label__0 The hotel staff was young and knowledgeable.
__label__0 Madrid is fabulous and I hope to return when the weather is warmer.
__label__1 I'd suggest staying away from the in hotel restaurant.
__label__0 it felt similar to the W (another Starwood hotel) but larger.
__label__1 I highly recommend the hotel, especially at the priceline rate of $55.00 per night ,+ tax and fees,.
__label__0 The Ritz made it worthwhile
__label__0 There were no Do Not Disturb signs.
__label__0 and the valet staff had their work cut out for them...
__label__0 Not quite the best value
__label__0 It was all white, with no goodies.
__label__0 Not many hotel kitchens offered food form the region for breakfast during the tour.
__label__0 It appears there is one main kitchen.
__label__0 I used Priceline Name your own price and got a room for a 2 night stay for $101 a night.
__label__0 but the work-out room was small, dimly-lit, and hot.
__label__0 Location is perfect for that part of the city , close to all.
__label__0 The obviously new beds and bedding were super-luxurious.
__label__0 We were always afraid it would go the way of many downtown hotels in North America - new furniture and higher prices.
__label__0 The location I would say is well within walking distance to the majority of sites up to the Brandenburg Gate and Reichstag, beyond that you may want to choose the U-Bahn or S-Bahn instead, the nearest one being in Alexanderplatz some 5 minutes away.
__label__1 If you book a room, ask for a space needle view--I stayed on the 6th floor in a corner room and had a nice view.
__label__1 If you go to Salem, take the Trolley Tour.
__label__0 The rooms are okay.
__label__0 Honestly, you can hear people whistling at other people on the street.
__label__0 The rooms are nice with some cute modern finishes.
__label__0 Not professional management
__label__0 And best of all, I booked this room on Expedia for a mere $105/night.
__label__0 The hotel looked very new.
__label__0 Otherwise you have no way of knowing what the restaurant hours are, rules about the towels, housekeeping number to call, etc.
__label__0 The smell was so strong that we actually brought it back to Boston.
__label__1 So bottom line is if you are an average american like me go to this resort.
__label__0 Then the breakfast.
__label__0 and my view was the wall to the parking lot.
__label__0 I did not notice traffic sounds during our stay, but I also sleep like the dead so it no surprise.
__label__0 It wasn't just one person, it was 2 staff members.
__label__0 There was no universal adapter in the room.
__label__0 Quite easy not to talk to a soul here.
__label__0 We arrived at the Eastgate Tower Suites and were amazed at how cute this hotel was.
__label__0 and the room we were given.
__label__0 The food was okay but very over priced, as you will find throughout the downtown area.
__label__0 Housekeeping leaves your windows open to air it out.
__label__1 The pools were very clean, but you had to get up at 5am to put your towel on a loung chair or you wouldnt get one by the pool or under an umbrella.
__label__0 Fabulous location - really couldn't get any better.
__label__0 The big problem for me was the fact that the rooms have an ever present sewer smell that hits you as soon as you walk in the room.
__label__0 Not a very warm reception upon check-in by the staff.
__label__1 You can find specials and packages on their website..
__label__0 Beds extremely comfortable.
__label__0 Our second night there, my husband and I were standing in the lobby, waiting for some friends,
__label__0 No matter where you are in the pool there is a bar close-by, not to mention the swim-up bar.
__label__0 they just didn't seem to care much.
__label__0 but I had better ones.
__label__0 The setting and pool are gorgous, but as others have said there are nowhere near enough loungers, so people were lying on the floor - not what you expect from a 5 star hotel.
__label__0 It is a small room with a small bathtub.
__label__0 Down the hall was the bathroom with shower, safe and toilet room ,yes the toilet is in its own room,.
__label__0 The bedding heavenly--we were on the club level
__label__0 We did however get some anti-Malaria pills from our doctor as there have been some outbreaks in the Punta Cana area this year.
__label__0 Took a room on the fourth floor, room was nice and clean, laminate floors throughout and a wonderfully powerful shower, plasma TV
__label__0 Room was nice but does need to be vacuumed more frequently than ours was..
__label__0 and we couldn't have picked a better place to stay.
__label__0 Dont judge a book by its cover
__label__0 its location was it_��_s main attraction to us.
__label__0 but for the location and price it was worth the 1 night stay.
__label__0 the weightroom seemed like an afterthought,
__label__0 They should have closed for such extensive work
__label__0 Overall, I was more than pleased with my experience and would strongly recommend this hotel, especially to those traveling on a budget.
__label__0 For 168 quid two adults three nights B and B you cannot be robbed
__label__0 Have just returned from 4 nights at this hotel.
__label__0 Not only will you hear every flush your neighbor makes but also a tremendous amount of street noise.I have no idea how this hotel secured a 4-star rating.
__label__0 The bathroom was decorated with marble tile and granite countertop.
__label__0 From what I saw while driving, the neighborhood is very picturesque.
__label__0 The sharks were much bigger than I was expecting.
__label__0 It doesnt have a swimming pool or a restaurant but wed actually call this an advantage.
__label__0 Japanese restaurant - There is a grill at every table so the cook makes the food in front of you.
__label__0 it has no frills, at least not my room, but so what?
__label__0 The only way I was able to stay here was by using some Marriott gift certificates we had.
__label__0 Room stuffy so opened window and was literally BLASTED by the noise from the extremely busy cross-roads right outside our window...
__label__0 I stayed at the Sheraton in Seattle one day before a cruise.
__label__0 They have LOccitaine products, which I love, so that was a bonus.
__label__0 There is a $20 deposit fee to use the safety box.
__label__0 Anyone running a bath/shower or using a hair dryer could be doing so in your own room.
__label__0 You can turn on the steam, pipe music into the bathroom and take a cool shower, all the while feeling you are showering outdoors in the tropics.
__label__0 Our room was not cleaned properly,
__label__0 Not many tables
__label__0 but the U-bahn is cheaper and gets you most everywhere.
__label__0 Having said that, the hotel is in a nice quiet spot, with the metro station only 50 yards away, the reception did speak some English which is always handy.
__label__0 and the Ginger Bread Houses were still no where to be found.
__label__0 Just as noisy too.
__label__0 The owners of the hotel couldnt be nicer or more helpful, gladly answering our questions and making sure our stay was a good one.
__label__0 and it was convenient as we took a tour to Mount Ranier one day
__label__0 WE DID THE SAME THING, THOUGH...
__label__0 One of the housekeeping staff gave us some great tips on what to see in the Blue Mountians and the Hunter Valley - local knowledge really helps.
__label__0 Supposedly a non smoking room it came complete with ash tray and matches.
__label__0 We were not able to upgrade , we arrived at 8:30pm, and they said that all the upgrade rooms were booked, but in my opinion the regular booking suffised.
__label__0 The staff at the restaurant were unapologetic and made no effort satisfy the problem.
__label__0 Both were very good.
__label__0 It eventually started working again, also for no obvious reason, so I never figured out what was wrong.
__label__0 Have fun and stay at the San Gallo Palace.
__label__0 Good location close to Chinatown and Little Italy.
__label__0 I would agree with earlier reviews that this hotel doesn't quite make the 5 star status it claims but is a very good 4 star property.
__label__1 If you dont want anything just say no and they leave you alone.
__label__0 Good areas to eat in the evening is around Hackescher Markt in the Hof complex on Oranienburger Str.
__label__0 In conclusion, New Orleans needs support.
__label__0 Nothing is too far away.
__label__0 The staff was quite rude,
__label__0 We got to the top, checked in and were placed in the room at the very end of the hall.
__label__0 I had to attend Berlin at rather short notice to attend a large conferenece of lawyers: INTA.
__label__0 This last trip (and it will be the last) we tried hotwire.com for the first time.
__label__0 They upgraded us for free.
__label__0 Fantastic, Fabulous, just perfect
__label__0 and as mentioned by others the location is superb.
__label__0 The Lobby has always been elegant but now it sparkled.
__label__0 the beds were comfortable
__label__0 We eventually managed to be shown to our table and ordered wine
__label__0 It is an ideally located hotel as we got off great airport express to Alexanderplatz, came out the station at the foot of the hotel.
__label__0 I paid $55.00/night ,booked online through a different site,.
__label__0 and we prefer to get a smoking room with windows or an outside balcony to minimize smoke inside the room.
__label__0 or brakes come to think of it!!
__label__0 Oh yeah, the casino is very nice, and drinks thre are always free ,Holdem tournament every Saturday Night,
__label__0 Well, there were issues with the shared bathrooms (I never found out what they were) so the desk clerk gave me a complimentary upgrade to a room on the 7th floor with its own very small bathroom and a view of the city and Lake Union in the distance.
__label__0 I doubt they have the capacity at that time to run a bath, never mind an airline -with hundreds of passengers wanting to go home and not wanting to wait as long as the flight time from berlin to get to the car park.
__label__0 Evidently mom was not such al light sleeper however.
__label__0 but some of the staff behind reception need a few lessons in customer service (ie.
__label__0 Subway is 2 blocks away.
__label__0 If you can get a room at a good price I would stay here
__label__0 The hotel is very close to Pike's Place Market.
__label__0 m.on Friday night that a fax was waiting for me at the front desk (the business center was closed), when I went to get it, the staff couldn't find it after 15 minutes of searching.
__label__0 Desk staff very helpful and pleasant---would definitely stay there again.
__label__0 The Savoy only has room suites on the 6th floor with air conditioning.
__label__0 We loved the beaches on Vieques and the lack of crowds made it all the more wonderful.
__label__0 They haven't no English instructions for the phone, they don't have a proper luggage deposit,
__label__0 The workout room had 2 elliptical trainers as well as a few other machines.
__label__0 The bathroom was small, but the kitchenette and large living room more than made up for it.
__label__0 For the next 5 days the resort had a series of rolling blackouts which they would announce with a note under your door everyday.
__label__0 From the time you walk in the door, this hotel makes you feel welcome.
__label__0 This hotel is highly regarded on tripadvisor and this is why we were happy to secure a booking for a late March weekend.
__label__0 I was given a room with connecting doors, when i went down and asked for an alternate room without connecting doors, I was told that 90 percent of the hotel had connecting doors.
__label__0 Hotel is near freeways, so central to getting around.
__label__0 On calling the reception desk there was no apology or alternative offer given.
__label__0 We didnt eat breakfast at the hotel.
__label__0 The staff were welcoming and helpful with suggestions of where to eat and what to do.
__label__0 Thier brochure and website rate this hotel as a four and half star property, but at the time of our visit it did not meet the standard of a three star property.
__label__0 Probably my main criticism with the hotel is it's size - the hotel is very big and somewhat impersonal.
__label__0 There are abundant taxis here
__label__1 Ask for room with an odd number thats starts over 13.
__label__0 I was on the 38th floor and had a great view of downtown and the water.
__label__0 As mentioned in previous reviews, there is no lift.
__label__0 Very noisy, not only within the hotel, but the construction noise ,even on the weekend, early in the morning.
__label__0 This resort even tried our patience.
__label__0 They certainly live up to the standard of The leading hotels of the world.
__label__0 Rooms were nothing special.
__label__0 Free guest computer with internet access and very friendly staff.
__label__0 Luckily I had a printout of my confirmation.
__label__0 In theory thats not a problem, but the reality was the noise from the street was pretty bad.
__label__0 and this is the first hotel that it could be locked up with room to spare.
__label__0 If you are looking for a place away from the noise and action of the city this is it.
__label__0 The main course was tasty, but I found the sushi wasnt extremely fresh.
__label__0 and a house doctor was called.
__label__0 However window was wide open and was broken.
__label__0 We spent most of the day on the beach.
__label__0 We shut the window in the evening because of the noise from the street
__label__0 I was so relieved to leave this place.
__label__0 Not so.
__label__0 I always try to stay near the Kudamm,
__label__0 but the weekend front desk staff can be rude.
__label__1 Also, if you are going during baseball season, you will have to buy a Red Sox hat, T-shirt, etc.
__label__0 Rooms are very small.
__label__0 and there were no problems at check in.
__label__0 We asked to be upgraded to the newer part of the hotel for an additional $35.00 per night, and as we left the old part of the hotel I mentioned to my sister that my right ear started ringing loudly as soon as we entered the room.
__label__0 My main impression was that the place seemed rather empty, even though I was there during one of the busiest weeks for Berlin tourism (ITB).
__label__0 It is just like being at that job you were trying to get away from.
__label__0 Modern-minimalis design and Clean
__label__0 The difference was stark.
__label__0 We never saw the course.
__label__0 We had our three children in a room next door to us and it was a truely magical experience for them.
__label__0 The hotel lobby has recently been renovated.
__label__1 I would recommend the place to anyone on a budget as you get a clean room for the money but I dont think Id stay here again.
__label__0 Hotel is half dozen blocks from Pike Place market, Seattle Art Museum.
__label__0 much better value that those of on La Rambla ?
__label__0 Also, i stayed for 4 nights and the breakfast kind of gets repititive after 2 days.
__label__0 Oh by the way, bedrooms have a free pillow menu
__label__0 They really did a nice job each day on our room.
__label__0 Would not stay again.
__label__0 He gave us a good deal of Euro 90 for double executive room ,incl. buffet breakfast and taxes,.
__label__0 That was it.
__label__0 Roomservices and questions are dealt with quickly by the friendly staff.
__label__0 but the room was a little small with a tiny bathroom.
__label__0 When I complained they told me tough move elsewhere.
__label__0 We found it worn and noisy.
__label__0 and the crowd that always seemed to be coming and going in the lobby.
__label__0 Rooms are small, but perfect for what a busy or active traveler needs.
__label__0 Staff gave accurate restaurant and transportation recommendations,
__label__0 My wife and myself were so impressed that we have swore to return for a long weekend.
__label__0 The $15 food credits did not satisfy us due to the poor quality of food, service and cleanliness.
__label__0 The bed and pillows were the best I have slept in.
__label__0 The building is clear and bright.
__label__0 Great service, great rooms, soft towels, good restaurants, great buffet.
__label__1 Note pedestrian area of the Rambla means in the evening taxis cannot approach and a walk may be required.
__label__0 Needless to say, because of previous comments, was a bit wary but how wrong could you be?
__label__0 Told us about a vegaterian restruant that had closed down years ago, a dry cleaners that was also shut.
__label__0 The staff was extremely helpful and was able to answer all of our questions.
__label__0 The room was spotlessly clean.
__label__0 The main staff of the hotel were all very nice
__label__0 It was delightful - very central to everywhere.
__label__0 Youd never have to leave if you so chose.
__label__0 Finally the pool was only open for use once during our one week stay.
__label__0 Negatives: Decor is very plain, nothing special, worn out.
__label__0 The front desk, however, was a horror show.
__label__1 If you dont want to stay in a hi tech hotel ,of which there are many in Madrid, and prefer a bit of old Spain - stay here.
__label__0 Our room is spacious with internet access, cozy modern-minimalis design and clean.
__label__0 It was a real bummer staying here!
__label__0 Only downside was those pesky chair palapa savers.
__label__0 Staff were friendly and helpful.
__label__0 The restaurant was pretty terrible - the worst nasi goreng I had in 2 weeks by far.
__label__0 Breakfast was good but staff had a bit of an attitude to be honest.
__label__0 while the other room never got that...
__label__0 Big breakfast included.
__label__1 Look around the same area for another hotel.
__label__0 The only bad thing was the missing aircondition,
__label__0 it was that good were are going to book into one of the other secret resorts for next summer
__label__0 We had an open mind.
__label__1 dont trust the staff here
__label__0 Otherwise there ar places nearer.
__label__0 I was expecting the worst and received the best.
__label__1 Rooms do not appear to have any functioning heating or built in fan/cooler/heaters which is a bit of a drawback depending on when you visit.
__label__0 My wife and I recently spent four nights at this excellent hotel,and it has been an unforgettable experience.
__label__0 Service: abysmal ,you are supposed to be assigned a peronal assistant to cater to your every whim...I got a phone number which was always busy and a front desk that could care less,.
__label__0 I challenged the charge in an e-mail to the hotel, and followed up with e-mails to the Hotel (twice), HiltonHonors and Hilton corporate.
__label__0 Good location for shops and the famous tourist sites.
__label__0 At the other resorts you bite into a burger your not really sure what kind of meat it is.
__label__0 I highly recommend this hotel and would love to stay there again
__label__0 Based on the evidence so far, this will be a triumph of hope over experience.
__label__0 They are always smiling and try to make you feel special.
__label__1 One thing: definitely try to get a high floored room away from the building works for the new skyscraper next floor.
__label__0 The minibar was well stocked and priced at the usual OTT rate!
__label__0 We got down later one morning, nearer 10 than 7, and there was still plenty to choose from.
__label__0 I didnt have a problem with the construction in the city and I came down mainly because NOLa needs support.
__label__1 As a general tip, if you need to use the internet whilst in Berlin, look up the Easy Internet cafes before you go, there's a huge one in Kurfurstendam
__label__0 Super Clean
__label__0 She said her right ear was also ringing in the historic room... very spooky
__label__0 and they even had a free shuttle to downtown which we only used on our first night becuase we soon realised just how close we really were to everything.
__label__0 Spent 3 nights recently at the Artotel Berlin Mitte.
__label__0 My girlfriend and me stayed at the hotel Cadran over the wekend.
__label__0 We had a room with double and single bed and it was a reasonable size.
__label__0 The schizophrenic state starts as you begin walking to your room, what an awful smell in the corridor.
__label__0 I was extremely disappointed with my stay at Seattle Sheraton.
__label__0 Thanks to him I was able to enjoy my stay.
__label__0 We, a Scottish couple, decided to visit Berlin for four days and after reading positive reviews regarding the location of the Hilton,
__label__0 The best part of the meal was the appetizers: meats, cheese, and the bread
__label__0 Even with the weak dollar, I thought it was a great value.
__label__0 The carpets in the rooms are stained and drains in the bath-tubs drain very slowly.
__label__0 The family that runs the hotel is wonderful, and will go out of their way to make you feel welcome ,in your language when possible, as well as book you reservations and make recommendations.
__label__0 The shuttle bus works excellent.
__label__0 The lobby is very nice and modern looking with white and grey marble.
__label__0 The mini bar is included.
__label__0 There are many other nice hotels who will accomodate their guests.
__label__0 We had booked a double room so we went to leave our bags and explore the hotel.
__label__0 The food was good for an all-inclusive.
__label__0 I have catered events at this hotel
__label__0 Location is convenient - Monoprix grocery/ drugstore is nearby, its a 15-20 minute walk to Opera Garnier and the department stores, 20-30 minute walk to the Champs Elysees.
__label__0 Manati park the last tour we took was also fun, a chance to see some of the island residents of the non-human persuasion.
__label__0 We got a rate of $99 on Priceline.
__label__0 and these neat microsoft tables that are like huge touch screens with local maps etc. They were pretty cool.
__label__0 I asked if an an opening came up, why didn't they call me since I was on the waiting list.
__label__0 Minimalist modern rooms; motorized blinds, glass bathroom, flat screen TV.
__label__0 The hotel is VERY secure....front door locked at 10 pm and a room key is needed to access guestroom floors at all times.
__label__0 Restaurants and bars Very good from bar snacks, to the chinese ,Ming Court I think?,
__label__0 The folks at the front desk were very poor on listening to our needs and were extremely uncooperative.
__label__0 My sixteen year old tech-savvy daughter and I spent 3 nights at the Diva while I was attending a conference at the Moscone Convention Center.
__label__0 We only ordered room service once.
__label__0 the room we had was quite large
__label__0 I had to have lights replaced and something else repaired.
__label__0 I've stayed at a lot of hotels on business trips
__label__0 They were very reluctant to help and solve complaints.
__label__0 The complimentary breakfast is great, and the staff in there is warm accomodating.
__label__0 Just returned from a 5 night stay at the waikiki beach hotel.
__label__0 The hotel is in a perfect location to walk to many downtown restaurants and shops.
__label__0 When we checked in, it looked like the 1st day of college dorm check in.
__label__0 and not interested in any problems you may have.
__label__0 I had asked for a quiet room.
__label__0 The hotel is located in the middle of the hill which makes walking not too easy.
__label__0 I accepted a reservation at the Ohana East, just around the corner.
__label__0 Service at the Ritz-Carlton has always been excellent and this stay the staff were at their best.
__label__0 When we checked in on Tuesday we were told that there would not be any diving available until Saturday, the day we were flying back to the US.
__label__0 I understand that these are luxury services
__label__0 but the only option because parking in Seattle is scarce.
__label__0 Professional and personable.
__label__0 I really cant imagine John and Yoko sitting amongst the crap Scottish memorabilia, but I hope its true.I have only ever eaten at the Chinese restaurant in the Okura - To Ka Lin - and it is exquisite.
__label__0 They made our reservations for the Bio Bay tours with Island Adventures and it was perfect.
__label__0 It is truly one of the best hotels in the world.
__label__0 The Warwick is within walking distance of most, if not all, of the tourist attractions Seattle has to offer.
__label__0 All in all, the complex is nice, the beaches are wonderful and the food is pretty good.
__label__0 The area is also central to many great tourist areas, museums, downtown, and shopping areas.
__label__0 So it was kind of easy to accidentally spill some water on the floor (not to mention slip and break your neck).
__label__0 but the front desk says the room is not available.
__label__0 You will not be dissapointed.
__label__0 The breakfast is also very nice and plentiful.
__label__0 However..it was in need of some updates and doesnt have a very welcoming atmosphere.
__label__0 However, under the duvet was a traditional old blanket.
__label__0 The location is convenient
__label__0 Every member of the staff bent over backwards to make us comfortable.
__label__0 Its not in a great neighborhood, but hey, most of New Orleans isnt a great neighborhood and the bums are everywhere.
__label__0 We were very cautious because we were taking our two year old daughter and wanted to ensure that it was suitable.
__label__0 We went fully aware that the rooms were small, and yes they were, but spotless and charming.
__label__0 I attended a conference and stayed at this hotel for three miserable nights.
__label__0 Inside though is a bit better, checking in was quick
__label__0 Staff were helpful but the breakfasts were a bit expensive.
__label__0 and then booked an extra night for the Wednesday night via Expedia.
__label__0 The lobby and rooms were a little shabby.
__label__0 we might not have been as unpleasantly surprised.
__label__0 Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in may 2008.
__label__0 The best room we have ever had.
__label__0 but we asked to be upgraded in rooms after my back started hurting from the bed.
__label__0 There is alway a breeze from the ocean, so it never feels too hot.
__label__0 Very nice touch.......until I went into the bathroom and found it infested with ants.
__label__0 We sat there for a couple of hours every afternoon with a drink or two just watching Venice pass by.
__label__0 All in all, a good value mid range hotel.
__label__0 Getting around Berlin is easy with public transportation very close by
__label__0 In all 3 rooms, there was a loud sound coming from the air conditioner/ heating system which we found unbelievable for an hotel.
__label__0 I believe that the cleaning people tried to get rid of the urine smell by bombarding our room with cleaning supplies.
__label__0 Around the hotel are many shopping places.
__label__0 The buffets has soo many choices of food.
__label__0 Eubanks, the bellman was wonderful
__label__0 We were essentially a 10 second walk from the beach
__label__0 Overall if you stay at the lenox you will not be disappointed
__label__0 I didn't hear any noise from outside.
__label__0 The Westin prides itself on its Heavenly Beds and I couldnt agree more with them.
__label__1 My recommendation: Save your money!
__label__0 our luggage just stayed in the lobby
__label__0 it is only a basic hotel, but with a convenient location (50 meters from the metro, 2 metro stations from Alexander platz).
__label__0 Slimey, dirty tiles.
__label__0 Definitely will stay there again
__label__0 Also, if you're the kind of person who likes to step out of their hotel and straight into the action,
__label__0 Comfortable large and clean.
__label__1 The room itself was small, but no smaller than other large city hotels- if you want room to walk, Id suggest taking the F down to Ferry Plaza.
__label__0 An Excellent Return Stay
__label__0 The decor is quite masculine - sort of comfortable modern look I suppose
__label__0 Like one of the other reviewers, I was also impressed that the room was ready when I arrived in the morning.
__label__0 and just walked in immediately after knocking.
__label__0 and sometimes that's all you can ask for.
__label__0 Although older, the hotel provided a clean and comfortable place to stay for our visit -- a one-night stay going over and several nights coming back from Australia.
__label__0 Out of the Way Hotel is stunning, luxurious and the views are really fantastic.
__label__0 they were not expecting us until the following day, where 3 nights were booked.
__label__0 Noisy on Weekend
__label__0 The Courtyard is very clean and is in a great location only 10 mins from Macys/Newbury Street.
__label__0 The front desk was unable to give us walking directions to the wharf (I would have thought a lot of people would have asked for that...).
__label__0 Both are yummy.
__label__0 Very nice, but in the morning you have the traffic.
__label__0 There was a pool and spa
__label__0 The service was horrendous,
__label__0 This floor is where the public meeting rooms
__label__0 but they needed a fork ,
__label__0 We guess the resort pays nothing to its workers, and is a mere sweat shop.
__label__0 The more frustrating kink was the hotels dinner reservation system.
__label__1 For both the beach and the pool, if you want a chair under a palapa to cover yourself from the sun, I suggest you get their early ,between 8 and 8:30, or before you have breakfast, take your towels and leave them on the chairs you want.
__label__0 It was also very nicely tucked on a side street so it was always very quiet.
__label__0 The main purpose of our visit was to see a concert at the Paramount Theatre
__label__0 be careful with this fact!!
__label__0 One evening I returned to my room to find both windows open.
__label__0 We found it to be a nice hotel.
__label__0 Made a reservation using the 50% Entertainment book discount (mentioned at time of reservation) and when we went to check in,
__label__0 I phoned the front desk to see if everything was okay and they acted like I was nuts to even ask while being up there 7 floors above.
__label__0 The lobby smelled.
__label__0 and this one was about in the middle in terms of quality.
__label__0 What a difference..
__label__0 For some reason, I had a bag which included a Harlequin romance novel and a womans razor included in my provided toiletries ,thanks for the free stuff, Union Square Hotel, but Im a guy,.
__label__0 BPappealed to me as a single parent, traveling with a teenage son.
__label__0 The view and breeze from the ocean makes this place really awesome.
__label__0 Beautiful decor and great views from the 3 windows in the room
__label__0 We stayed at the sofitel for two days on a jolly to Berlin.
__label__0 Because of all the positive comments we had read here, we werent too worried about our stay.
__label__0 Taxis are required for down town and the business district.
__label__0 Wake-up calls are done by staff and you even have the option when making the reservation for more than one wake-up ,which one of my sleepy colleagues certainly appreciated,.
__label__0 The neighborhood was marginal��_��__ must not be far from a landfill- the stink was terrible
__label__0 We asked to speak to a Manager for help,
__label__0 The location is simply perfect and the staff must be among the friendliest and most helpful we have ever come across.
__label__0 Very very unfortunate for us that Park Inn was fully booked
__label__0 Breakfast is one of the best I ever had,
__label__0 Very nice breakfast.
__label__1 I would recommend this place, but arm yourself with good information from people who have stayed there before.
__label__1 Business oriented, and highly recommeded for that purpose
__label__0 We waited, waited, waited... the entrees?
__label__0 The room was small but not tiny.
__label__0 Excellent Hotel Lovely hotel, quiet location just off la Ramblas.
__label__0 I was really shocked,
__label__0 That bed was AWESOME
__label__0 our room had been changed to a room with one king bed (very, very small) and a lower floor.
__label__0 We took the Bart from SFO $4.95 each and walked a few blocks to the hotel.
__label__0 There is no way I would pay anything over 200 a night to stay here.
__label__0 It took about 20 minutes for them to figure out how to sell me some coffee in a paper cup.
__label__0 The staff though is nice and friendly.
__label__0 I tried politely to explain that after 25 years int he hotel industry I knew that they could, in fact, transfer a booking within the hotel if they really wanted to - again, to no avail.
__label__0 My husband and I stayed at the Warwick for 2 nights this summer.
__label__0 If you are going to be making use of the fantastic public transport across Berlin, then this hotel is an ideal (though slightly expensive) base from which to explore this amazing city.
__label__0 Also the staff are very friendly and it is based near a variety of restaurants/bars and clubs.
__label__0 but I had the desplausure of meating(not all)but the most recist people in my life
__label__0 Breakfast was very good, cheese and cold meats, boiled eggs yoghurts, cereals, juice and a wide array of pastries and fresh fruit.
__label__0 but my points are valuable
__label__0 The location of the hotel is right on Kurf��__rstendamm and very close to the Zoo and Ged�__nknich kirsche.
__label__0 but please see my review of the Condado Plaza.
__label__0 for instance, my door didn't even close properly - but after requesting to change rooms i found out none of them do!
__label__0 At first the check in person at the convenience store would not give me another room stating that everything was taken until we realized that the toilet was leaking into the bedroom.
__label__0 Found one bar just down the street taking a right out of the hotel which was a good night and one lovely one set in the walled garden area found by walking out of the hotel taking a left and left again and there is a large wall opposite 
__label__0 When I threatened to leave to go to another place down the road he gave us another room on the upper floor.
__label__0 She left a roll of gabage bags on the bathroom sink, I guess that was for me to do.Overall, I did not care for the service that I recieved.
__label__0 The quality of food and service at the breakfast room was fantastic.
__label__0 This hotel was The Business.
__label__0 I was very disappointed in the service since they remodeled their lobby.
__label__0 Nice, but not top quality
__label__0 juice and coffee so ordered from the menu.
__label__0 We will not return and there are many reasons why.
__label__0 The suite we had was great and the option of the fold out sofa made things better for the four of us.
__label__0 I won't be staying at this Sheraton again anytime soon.
__label__0 I reserved a top floor suite with ocean veiw.....they put me on the first floor over looking a ton of screaming kids.
__label__0 only downside was that the laminate floors meant that when the cleaners came round in the morning the noise from the corridor was greatly amplified.
__label__0 The Concierge lounge, access to which I receive due to my frequency of Marriott-branded use, was across the hotel resulting in a trip down the elevator, across the lobby and back up.
__label__0 Staff were friendly, and service was excellent.
__label__0 Slow service given a nearly empty restaurant.
__label__0 Its not the Hyatt, Hilton or Ritz Carlton, but its a nice hotel for the price and location, and only one block from the beach.
__label__0 We never met the infamous Storm even though the reviews on his service were the final factor in booking this hotel.
__label__0 We stayed at Rydges World Square for one night during a quick trip to Sydney.
__label__0 It is VERY expensive though.
__label__0 I was expecting a lot from this hotel.
__label__0 There was no air conditioning, but that seems to be the norm in Seattle.
__label__0 The promised cookies and milk in the evenings did not come as scheduled and the breakfast items were slim.
__label__0 Taking the funicular down to the marina was a bit of a project.
__label__0 While one opened my door, neither of them got my bags out of the cab, nor did they offer a single female assistance into the hotel.
__label__1 For those looking for things to do whilst in Berlin, I would highly recommend the walking tours offered by Original Berlin Walks (Discover Berlin) and Sandemans New Berlin (Red Berlin Tour and the Free Tour).
__label__0 We have just returned from a very pleasant 3 night stay at the Jolly Carlton in Amsterdam during the period between Christmas and New Year.
__label__0 Being out on the balcony made me forget a bit that I was in NYC.
__label__0 Despite this, I would stay at Casablanca again if I was lucky enough to come to New York.
__label__0 I had to do with the leftovers at 9 o clock.
__label__0 Though, thatd be a nice touch.
__label__0 It was newly renovated and very large.
__label__0 and secondly failed to send me any kind of confirmation.
__label__0 We went to a Giants game, the wharf, and a concert on the bus/street car and Bart and never waited more than 5-10 minutes for a ride.
__label__0 though the swimming pool was a bit short for my liking.
__label__0 A great hotel, with large, clean rooms and attentive staff.
__label__0 It's about $10 per day but the signal strength is super weak and inconsistent.
__label__0 I particularly like the free continental b-fest of muffins, bagels, cereal and yogurt, and the free gym which I noticed was recently re-furbished.
__label__0 but the workings underneath are old.
__label__0 Sand fleas or ants in room, which I am not a beach person so didnt know if this was normal or not???
__label__0 The Borgmann Villa Hotel is located right on the magnificent Vodel Park in the Museum Quarter of Amsterdam.
__label__0 The bath is finished in marble with a deep tub and hand-held shower which was a nice touch.
__label__0 On the positive side - the Executive Lounge, although a little cramped, offered free drinks and appetizers everynight from 5 - 9pm and the Exec Concierge was very helpful.
__label__0 we often were brought courses twice because of the lack of communication.
__label__0 We definitely recommend it.
__label__0 The location is perfect for shopping and restaurants.
__label__0 They acussed me and some friends of taking something from the minibar - they acussed us of lying.
__label__0 but still stumped at exactly what was so heavenly about the bed.
__label__0 I was surprised to see that in such a high end chain hotel.
__label__0 Simply the Best
__label__0 One of the reasons why there appears to be a difference of opinion regarding the star rating for this hotel is possibly because the hotel is made up of two distinct blocks.
__label__0 Call ahead, but I think that offered a different show each day.
__label__0 Staff very friendly.
__label__0 It was supermarket quality.
__label__0 We stayed at the Boston Wyndham and found it was close to many of the attractions, especially Fanueil Hall/Quincy Market.
__label__0 We actually stayed at this W twice in ten days.
__label__0 Simone is a great hotel near Victoria Station.
__label__0 Last time they asked for my drivers license.
__label__1 Walk to Pike Place in the morning, shopping at Pioneer Square in the afternoon, visit nearby Belltown at night.
__label__0 So after all that, no pool, hot tub or gym.
__label__0 We had Spanish speakers with us but could do nothing- it was a take it or leave it attitude, and the same thing happened when some of our female staff were intimidated by german students in the room next door over the following days.
__label__0 I would never stay at this hotel again.
__label__0 I spoke directly with Air Transat reservations to assist in choosing a property because this was our first visit to the Dominican.
__label__0 You get it in the Library though
__label__0 Like dating a supermodel...
__label__0 Seems like this would be the end of the nightmare right? WRONG
__label__0 Parking for $9 was the cheapest we saw on our trip.
__label__0 and we were not notified in advance that services promised (business center, concierge) would not be available.
__label__0 As previously reported, they do provide you with dark chocolate at turndown.
__label__0 the service was excellent.
__label__0 I believe the Moore is the best budget hotel I've ever stayed in.
__label__0 This is the first trip my husband and I have taken by ourselves.
__label__0 The beach and the hotel lobby was beautiful however, the room left a lot to be desired.
__label__1 I think guests should get to park for free.
__label__0 The best thing about the Westin, as everybody has already stated, is the location.
__label__0 We stayed at The Globus for two nights in May.
__label__0 Not having stayed in any other hotel in Paris I did not have anything to judge it on, but if we went again i think i would look around first.
__label__0 Rude staff and to top it off you have to pay for the Wi Fi!!!
__label__0 It has all the facilities of a 4 star hotel including a business centre, but beware they charge $17 for 30 minutes internet usage.
__label__0 But I was quite surprised at the decor of the room - seemed like it hadn't been updated since the 80's. But to us, this didn't matter.
__label__0 At any rate, I have no idea how they can call themselves 5-star.
__label__0 Why was the Sofitel New York so different and so good?
__label__0 We swam out to island about 100 yds off shore only to realize that current on way in was very strong.
__label__0 However one of the redeeming features of the Palace Hotel is its location.
__label__0 When we went the back the unhelpful receptionist's told us that in fact we were expected there and not the sister hotel, we should never have been sent away.
__label__0 Very good experience
__label__0 Room service during both stays was excellent.
__label__0 A beautiful lagoon to take walks along.
__label__1 I highly recommend spending the extra money and staying in one of the rooms on the club level.
__label__0 If I were going back to Seattle just for vacation, I would probably try a different hotel.
__label__0 and the bathroom was alright.
__label__0 Told them our choice and they registered our names with the bus desk.
__label__0 Our room was very nicly furnished and clean with a large bathroom.
__label__0 It was 1:30 am before we could finally settle down and rest.
__label__0 We had to walk up the stairs to the parking garage and get our confirmation from our luggage
__label__0 The rooms themselves are very modern, but almost frustratingly so.
__label__0 So the hard work, quality food, and other amenities they are providing are 10X higher than what they are used to receiving in their day to day lives.
__label__0 This was a good recommendation.
__label__0 The front desk staff was also very nice.
__label__0 The hotel is very tired and is in desperate need of a refurb.
__label__0 m. on Thursday morning -- 36 hours before I received it.
__label__0 Sure enough, they did move us the next day into a beautiful room with a gorgeous view of the Space Needle.
__label__0 This truly is a superlative property.
__label__0 Hotel breakfast buffet was good value and American.
__label__0 Watch the bartender at Tikis, they let some blond guy from Iowa charge his drinks to my tab without asking me about it.
__label__0 We also had our own patio area where where we could hang wet clothes, snokel gear, etc. ,seperate patio but not secluded from view of other rooms,.
__label__1 but for a really great breakfast walk a block to the Mayflower Park Hotel (pricey but fabulous).
__label__0 Big enough and confortable for my husband, daughter and me.
__label__0 and that I would get a higher floor room with two beds.
__label__0 The staff was friendly and completely bilingual.
__label__0 Staff are very helpful, attentive, smiling and say hello to you in the morning.
__label__0 Internet Connection is rated to 22 Euros per night which is very high.
__label__0 I found at all places they tend to cook with ALOT of oils and salt.
__label__0 they are overpriced, and service in this case was subpar.
__label__0 the resort makes it diffficult to attain and book such reservations.
__label__0 OK Hotel was pretty centrally located - nice rooms, but air conditioning not controllable.
__label__0 Everything is right there and you are in walking distance of Pike Market Place.
__label__0 I was very lucky to get this hotel.
__label__0 There is one restaurant across the street, a steakhouse, and three tourists on the street advised us not to eat there.
__label__0 Bedroom was standard size and decorated in classic style.
__label__0 Walking distance of Fishermans Wharf, Alcatraz Ferry, and the F-Line Street car and cable cars.
__label__0 very ugly room.
__label__0 Good location - average rooms - Great Exec Lounge
__label__0 The Cartwright has managed to update itself over the years without the lossof its old fashioned charm.
__label__0 The guest service rep took my room number, dates of stay, name and phone number, and said that they would call me if someone turns it in.
__label__0 Seems they had a major problem...They were ABSENT.
__label__1 The mall had many restaurants, including a pretty good dim sum ,recommended,.
__label__0 Upon arrival was informed that our room was unavailable - 'there was a problem'.
__label__0 It was clean and tidy and as there was a thermostat in the room, the temperature was just right.
__label__1 So, make sure you pay attention
__label__1 Overall, I would not recommend this hotel.
__label__0 Hotel is located within 500m of the Duomo and within easy walking distance of all the major sights.
__label__0 This was very easy and the concierge gave us train times and directions.
__label__0 We ate in One Market the evening before and to be honest even though it is more expensive would probably opt to eat there again rather than the Americano, theres nothing wrong with the Americano just that One Market just gave that little bit more for your Dollar.
__label__0 It is one short block from Kuhio Beach to the West and a short block from Kapiolani Park and the Honolulu Zoo to the South.
__label__0 i got engaged on the beach here and had the time of our lives.
__label__0 (Fully booked?
__label__0 One person would bring water, the other appetizers..
__label__0 Why?
__label__1 just keep your wits about you and you will have no problems.
__label__0 I had emailed the hotel before we left for Seattle to get a late check-out.
__label__0 Their breakfasts were wonderful and so was their afternoon wine and cheese.
__label__0 the front desk service can be loveable, rude or hard to understand; and the water pressure isn't the greatest.
__label__0 A good, solid, basic HI Express hotel right in the heart of Hollywood.
__label__0 I would not rate the hotel experience we had as 5 star, something on par with a 3 or 4 star but certainly not 5 star.
__label__0 They gave us the room we asked for, topfloor with the view to the water.
__label__0 Otherwise I would look elsewhere.
__label__0 Got into Luton at 10.35pm by Easyjet.
__label__1 It is in a great location for the Hollywood area, it is right next to a subway stop, but to get around in Los Angeles you will need a car.
__label__0 This hotel is very quiet and convenient.
__label__0 Ok so125 kgs will do it-but crikey some of those bed springs had surely seen better days.Ah now for some TV-but wait no remote-125 kgs jumping up and down to change channels,is not on.
__label__0 We felt that the room was a little small but was kept scupriously clean.
__label__0 Would I ever I go back to the Punta Cana, yes, would I ever go back to the Paradisus, definitely not.
__label__0 To say that I have a room locked in and then to DOWN GRADE me, is inexcusable.
__label__0 I left a note for the general manager and asked for his comments.
__label__0 but I haven't found any kind of design in the rooms.
__label__0 The hotel lobby, hallways and elevators are not at all impressive and very small, but the large clean rooms are a pleasant surprise when you open the room door.
__label__0 The coffee in the room of course was great ,this being Seattle,.
__label__0 The room was effectively air conditioned (i.e. you could control temperature and speed yourself)
__label__0 Taxis should make this no problem.
__label__0 If we had been able to contact her, we would have requested a change in accommodation.
__label__0 email me any questions and I will gladly answer them.
__label__0 Clean everywhere - even the beach/pool bathrooms.
__label__0 Would happily recommend.
__label__0 The lobby and dining areas are fine.
__label__0 My wife and I did a lot of walking
__label__0 I immediately came out and approached another housekeeper, who informed that she was sending someone right away.
__label__0 this makes everywhere very easily accessible.
__label__0 The area was really nice, away from the crazy busy areas.
__label__1 They either need to rewrite the policy on the amount of time a cart can be kept by guests or put DVD players in all rooms.
__label__0 Just one otherword of advice- and not about the hotel.
__label__0 I loved the sliding bathroom door and the beds were very comfy and so were the pillows and bedding.
__label__0 Contrary to other reviews, I found the prices at both the restaurant and the lounge to be comparable and fair considering the location of the hotel in the Financial District and the level of service and quality provided.
__label__0 although this would only be a problem in the summer.
__label__1 go through the large gate and to the left is a lovely little outside bar area ___��_��___?
__label__0 Pools- Three large pools that everyone can use, one for the upgraded travellers.
__label__0 I followed the advice that many people wrote and signed up for a free Sofitel Privileges card and also emailed the hotel to let them know we were there to celebrate our anniversary.
__label__0 The bathroom was very stylish in appereance, but at closer look,
__label__0 Receptionists are friendly and Internet access is a big plus point,
__label__0 The luggage came sometime later while we were at dinner.
__label__0 The room was so loud from buses
__label__0 Waiters friendly but 70% spoke no english and was sometimes difficult to get the right thing.
__label__0 King size bed (plus added squeaky springs) with two single duvets.
__label__0 The bathroom was clean and nice.
__label__0 and the rooms were pretty clean.
__label__0 Walking the Freedom Trail also helped.
__label__0 Never crowded and it has both sunny and shaded areas.
__label__0 Upon searching for somewhere to eat we discovered that the place was like a ghost town,not a bad thing, and that the only place to eat was at the italian restaurant.
__label__0 I would not hesitate to return or to recommend the PCP to anyone.
__label__0 We had a wonderful time
__label__0 and I was directed to the wrong set.
__label__0 Breakfast is delicious and plentiful.
__label__0 With the highest breakfast prices we've ever seen, it would have been nice to have in-room beverage stations/coffee makers like one usually finds in Westins.
__label__0 There was a big choice at breakfast and again the staff were very friendly and quick to take your order for hot drinks and the made to order omelettes, scrambled eggs etc.
__label__0 Quiet, modern hotel
__label__0 Next time we are in San Fran we will likely stay at the Westin, but as a more economical alternative only 2 blocks down, this place is great
__label__0 Dukes was fantastic, we had breakfast there every morning and also dinner once.
__label__0 Stayed here for four nights.
__label__0 The hotel is clean, the rooms were comfortable.
__label__0 All hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.
__label__0 The AC worked fine and the room was very clean.
__label__0 If you go with the attitude that you are on vacation and leave your expectations at home, you will have the time of your life.
__label__0 The repfrom Go Go another Hector was also great.
__label__0 In one word, PARKING.
__label__0 The room had an odor , its a good thing I brought the febreeze,, and next time I think Ill spend the extra money and get something decent because this hotel was far from it.
__label__0 It has gone downhill in recent years.
__label__0 Other than that, we had a mini bar stocked with beer, pop and water ,left the maid $5 the first day and asked for additional water - she kept us fully supplied with the latter,.
__label__0 I sent my husband to get me an Aspirin until we buy one at a pharmacy.
__label__0 The refrigerator didnt work, it was found to have a faulty outlet and fixed immediately.
__label__0 , even though I was told I was being upgraded,I must say though their response was quick and I was switched to a beautiful room on the 40 th floor facing all the action.
__label__0 The Greyline tour buses and airport shuttle have a desk in the lobby
__label__0 When we complained about the smell the staff simply told us to open the windows.
__label__0 We encountered many other tourists at different SF sights asking us where we were staying, and they said that we were lucky to be there because of the reputation of the place.
__label__0 It goes every 20min to the NH Barbizon ,much more expensive, across the central station ,near the red light district,.
__label__0 The food and wine on level 2 is a great option and my kids loved being able to go down and snack.
__label__0 Easyjet do not arrange for offloading facilities on a Saturday evening
__label__0 Breakfast was also a problem.
__label__0 The answer is pretty simple - you just cannot fault the Okura for price, location and for comfort.A previous reviewer commented on the decor seeming old fashioned.
__label__0 We came out from the game and our rentals window had been broken and everything we owned was stolen.
__label__0 Then, another bellhop was passing by others with children in the lobby and scowled at them for no reason at all.
__label__0 When we arrived Sat 10th March and went to check in, the receptionist explained that she did not have a room for us that night but only on Sunday, and we could stay in a 4 star nearby and then come back the following night.
__label__0 The hotel has maximum 6 floors.
__label__0 The staff does a nice job entertaining the children.
__label__0 Our doorman, Nick, arranged our transportation to the port and that was $25 plus tip.
__label__0 Oh, and on check out, they had charged me for the bottled water that they did not bring me, so of course, I protested , and they reluctantly took it off of my bill.
__label__0 good hotel located at alexander platz like 15 minutes by taxi to shopping areasclean midsize room ,mine was a single with little strange configuration in the hotel corner everything correct hotel with modern decorgood breakfast buffet included in rateperfect for business with a lot of restaurants around go for the italian left hand size of square coming from the hotel
__label__0 The prices were high, but the location cant be beat.
__label__0 The only real downside of this hotel is its bar: It is a cigar bar
__label__0 All the good hotels in town were completely booked out which left me the Alsterhof as my only option.
__label__0 NOW, today I received my credit card bill and found that this place falsely charged my credit card for a stay
__label__0 In fact, of the 5 hotels we stayed at in total the Millennium Plaza was the only one which did not offer free WIFI.
__label__0 but we did not try them.
__label__0 $12/day including tax for internet?
__label__0 We enquired about other breakfast restaurants,
__label__0 I am glad I got a discount.
__label__1 If you can get the rate this is a great stopover and the staff have a lot of nice touches like getting us some water for the cab ride back to the airport.
__label__1 Ate dinner at Georgetown - highly recommended
__label__0 We had to eat at dirty tables, surrounded by dirty dishes to consume lukewarm or cold meals.
__label__0 It was reasonable on my company rate, very well located for tourist and shopping and was clean and modern.
__label__0 Which for this hotel was very good value.
__label__0 Wonderful concierge who recommended restaurants as well as sent me to a bike shop where i could rent a bike to ride around frankfurt for the day.
__label__0 We explained that they were our friends FROM SF there to show us around...only helping us carry our luggage.
__label__1 Perhaps the secret is to book the executive rooms because they certainly are spacious ,you can upgrade on check in,.
__label__0 I had read reviews on this site that the older smaller rooms were dated and dirty but this was not the case at all.
__label__0 The location is superb, the best of New York is at your feet.
__label__0 The food doesnt even compare to cruise food.
__label__0 They said it would be parked in a garage, but I am not sure that happened.
__label__0 Little gifts everyday of our stay made it easier to be away from home during the holiday.
__label__0 Its a very quick ride.
__label__0 Wonderful experience.
__label__0 Actually, I was one day early but since the hotel was about 17% occupied, it wasnt a problem.
__label__0 The only drawback about the hotel is that the rooms located on the South side of the buidling facing Diamond Head are subject to some pretty terrible noise.
__label__0 The hotels air conditioning went out while we were in our meeting, and we were boiling, but they did nothing to accommodate us, or discount the meeting room charge.
__label__0 The French Quarter is indecent shape but there are a lot of vacant buildings.
__label__0 All in all, Secrets Excellence is a first rate hotel, with a caring and dedicated staff who went out of their way to make us comfortable and happy.
__label__0 Room service was on the pricey side - two coffees were 11 Euro.
__label__0 My son and I had the misfortune to be sharing the floor with a couple who had a toddler.
__label__0 Dumper trucks, buses etc all from 4am....not much sleep at all.
__label__0 The location was VERY convenient, both to BART, the cable car lines, and the F streetcar.
__label__0 It has recently been remodeled and looks beautiful, very modern and super clean.
__label__0 For example, the primary assailant attempted to murder one of my traveling companions as her hair was pulled and head held under water while her husband who shouted sexual obsenities toward us watched.
__label__0 Breakfast was excellent, with a very good selection of food and very good service.
__label__1 Much better option is to venture a little into the side streets.
__label__0 it was around the corner and across the road.
__label__0 If you cant be without the internet there is even free access in the bar.
__label__0 For some reason the radio can be controlled on the headboard of the bed and the speaker is mounted in the ceiling.
__label__0 We were able to eliminate this by opening the patio doors for a couple of hours each day and by keeping the lid closed on the toilet.
__label__0 We will definitely stay here again.
__label__0 PROS:Brothers who run the hotel are very helpful.
__label__0 They were selling broadway theater tix at the concierge desk.
__label__0 and it was our third time being disappointed.
__label__0 The size of the room was adequate
__label__0 the smell that came out of the vent was disgusting.
__label__0 When we brought this up with the front desk clerk he shrugged his shoulders and said all two bed rooms in this hotel are like that.
__label__0 Breakfast was sufficient for being free and the pool was nice.
__label__0 If I had one complaint, it was the quality of the fruit served for breakfast.
__label__0 The room also has its own balcony which has not been cleaned for ages
__label__0 Because the Hotel made a great visit to New York even better.
__label__0 The NewPort Beachside Resort had put a charge hold on my debit card.
__label__0 I had to go into the little kitchen to find someone to show.
__label__0 He will do nothing but smile in your face and tell you have a nice day after he has ruined it.,
__label__0 Beach Bar - very slowBar by Hibiscus Restaurant - very unfriendly and bad set up not guest friendly.
__label__0 Stayed there for 2 nights at December 2004.
__label__0 and while they don't do room service (contrary to what the hotel information book in the room says),
__label__0 and there was scaffolding hanging outside of our window all three days that we were there.
__label__0 After reading all these good reviews I stayed in first class room ,nothing first class about it; small room, no amenities - shampoo etc available, and after the third night ,they had not changed the sheets, I found a little blood in the sheets.
__label__0 Having previously enjoyed a great week's stay at the sister art'otel in Berlin (the Warhol-themed City Centre West), we decided to book a 4-night stay at this hotel so we could visit more of the sights on the eastern side of the city.
__label__0 The room was fairly spacious with a big window ledge you could set things on, a large table for a desk, two chairs and a table for a reading corner, 2 beds with comfortable bedding.
__label__0 overall a great hotel.
__label__0 Off site tours are readily available through a few select on site tour companies, Apple and Prieto are the 2 that seem to have the biggest following.
__label__0 When we arrived, we found that there was no self parking available, only valet parking.
__label__0 It was quiet and peaceful almost all of the time.
__label__0 Bed and linens were on par with the Westin Heavenly Bed.
__label__0 but it accomodated very well for 4 professional twenty-something girls.
__label__0 Not much view as its almost 2 blocks from beach.
__label__0 The dead mouse outside the front door didnt help- nor did the refuse container outside the front door ,it was not emptied the entire time we were there-overfull with food, butts, styrofoam cups, etc and smelled horrible,.
__label__0 This hotel completed extensive renovations in 2006
__label__0 Whenever we approached the front desk,their offer of assistance always preceded our requests.
__label__0 Errors upon checkin.
__label__0 Breakfast is included in the main restaurant and has everything you might need or like.
__label__0 Breakfast was adequate, but the worst I've had in all my trips to Berlin.
__label__0 The overall experience was greater than the sum of the parts.
__label__1 though you need to check the sheets before crawling into bed.
__label__0 I asked that the fax, when found, be delivered to my room.
__label__1 The dessert place was very good as well ,also recommended,.
__label__0 and that we should point out the booking code on our print-out.
__label__0 The room itself had a popcorn ceiling and poorly textured walls.
__label__0 After 1 night, the mildew was aggravating my allergies, so i asked to be switched to a different room.
__label__0 The staff are surly
__label__0 The Moore is located perfectly within easy walking distances of most attractions and downtown Seattle.
__label__0 Think Hilton quality and you will be pleasantly surprised
__label__0 Very fun and nice to see the countryside.
__label__0 and I would consider this hotel over the Westin aand W Seattle next time we are in town.
__label__0 There was a nice big desk area and two comfortable chairs in a seating area.
__label__0 All in all, it was a great stay!
__label__0 Like others before, i agree that the lift took ages to arrive at times, which was mildly frustrating.
__label__0 The location along the cable-car track put me at one end to Market Street and a connection near the top of Nob Hill brought me into either Union Square or Fishermans Wharf in good time to enjoy the many things that San Francisco had to offer.
__label__0 Have just returned from a weekend in Barcelona with 12 girlfriends who all had a fantastic time at the H10 Marina.
__label__0 Expect, as with all beach hotels in Punta Cana, people to solicit you frequenty on the beach for tourism trips and excursions, etc.
__label__0 This is a five star property!
__label__0 There isnt all that much around the hotel to walk to with the exception of Mamma Melenas up the street ,excellent Italian food in a very relaxed setting with superb service,.
__label__0 The bathroom was average - small,
__label__0 We have had problems each time.
__label__0 We would stay there again as the hotel, bar and restuarant are all very good lively places, its just a shame that in the last place of our Honeymoon we were greeted by such an abrasive staff member, maybe she should look for a career which isnt customer facing.
__label__0 Plus we saw a thief on a main street walk into a restaurant and calmly start to walk out with someones camera.
__label__0 Couldn't notice any strange smells in the lifts as mentioned by a previous poster.
__label__0 The connecting roads to this area are in the late evenings and nights a dangerous place to be.
__label__0 and the Moore's downtown location is good.
__label__0 The hotel is located in a pretty good location, in the shopping district and about a 1/2 mile walk to Pikes Market.
__label__0 My room was not huge but I thought it was pretty good for SF.
__label__0 The room was spacious and smelled beautiful - cant ever remember a hotel room smelling SO floral....but not overwhelming.
__label__0 The hotel personnel told that it is a standard noise for all rooms.
__label__0 The parents and the children were well mannered.
__label__0 Can't wait to go back !!!!
__label__0 We found the service variable, ranging from very helpful to down right rude and argumentative when we checked in having used a booking service instead of the hotels direct system.
__label__0 The front desk staff, however are not helpful and pass the buck so as not to have to deal with a problem.
__label__0 Rooms were fine - ,some nicer than others,, but all were cleaned every day.
__label__0 I loved the chips and gucamole.
__label__0 Turns out that was not what the hotel offered.
__label__0 and we thought it was inordinately expensive.
__label__1 Also, if you need services find a good front desk clerk, they helped us find a rental car when we were told none were available at all locations we called.
__label__0 The hotel is in a convenient location, walking distance to many areas.
__label__0 The rooms are kept clean , but since the hotel is quite old,
__label__0 Saved up all year for my 14 yr old son and myself to have a relaxing, enjoyable break in Berlin, found this hotel on web but due to technical probs, ended up booking via travel agent.
__label__0 We called Jeff at the hotel to tell him we would be late and to be sure and hold the room.
__label__0 The resort is gated, no local people live there, they only come there to work.
__label__0 Active bar in the evening.
__label__0 The staff was very nice and helpful.
__label__0 There was a construction site next to hotel
__label__0 The hot-tub was luke warm at best
__label__0 He should have been the one to resolve the matter.
__label__1 If you are a drinker you will feel like you died and went to heaven; one can drink the day away with many choices and the $76.00 will feel like a bargain.
__label__0 The hotel is spotlessly clean.
__label__0 Check in went smoothly.
__label__0 No cafes or shops within safe walking distance.
__label__0 We had a south facing room which meant we were away from the main noise from the traffic and could see the main highrises around Alexanderplatz but did overlook some other grotty buildings.
__label__0 The problems at the hotel resulted in our having a vacation from hell instead of a vacation in paradise.
__label__0 23 (Garden and conservatory part).
__label__0 We were excited to be alone in what was described as paradise little did we know we would have been better off staying at home.
__label__0 Stayed here in June/06 for 7 nights.
__label__0 Put your towel on the wet floor or you will definitely slip.
__label__0 We did not frequent the bars so did not tip when we went up for the odd drink.
__label__0 Roomcleaning takes place in as loud a fashion as possible.
__label__0 you are supposed to be dining there, to be very frustrating.
__label__0 After three weeks travelling in CA and staying in all types of accommodation ,5 star, BBs etc, The Chancellor is one of the nicest places we have stayed.
__label__0 Great stay at the Westin
__label__0 Immacuately clean.
__label__0 I have to refer to the most disgusting thing in this hotel.
__label__0 Staff was friendly and hard-working - yes, many are from other European countries, but all work hard and are very friendly, so I cant see why some reviewers ,and even some hotel-guests we overheard, would mention it as if it was a negative
__label__0 We booked the Berlin Mark Hotel and not the Appt Berlin Mark Hotel.
__label__0 There was no limit on the amount of reservations you were allowed.
__label__0 As I pulled down the covers to go to bed I saw another bed bug crawling along the sheets.
__label__0 You get a nice cold towel also.
__label__0 The concierge was very helpful with local restaurants.
__label__0 Nice clean hotel, location not great though
__label__0 The 6th floor however, is NOT non-smoking;
__label__0 Great place to vacation.
__label__0 My husband and I stayed at The Moore for 3 nights/4 days beginning on September 15th.
__label__0 I moved to the Inn on Queen Anne which was slightly more expensive but had a kitchenette, friendly staff and a much better vibe.
__label__0 They don't realize the power of Trip adviser!
__label__0 The food was pretty good.
__label__0 and we were assigned room 553.
__label__0 Christmas in Berlin was a wonderful experience here.
__label__0 The room was nice and comfortable.
__label__0 I hate that.
__label__0 Just spent 5 days at Hilton with wife and two teenagers.
__label__0 Groundstaff couldn't care less.
__label__0 Breakfast in bed was delicious and elegant.
__label__0 Taking his advice was a big mistake - there are no trains to Schoenefeld via Bundes Platz on a Sunday.
__label__0 Unless you are into travel nightmares.
__label__1 Be careful of the room type if you are more than one person.
__label__0 According to the Pan Pacifics rates, the cheapest room in the place is $340 per night, but we found a great all-inclusive deal that averaged out to about $100 per night.
__label__0 The location is wonderful.
__label__0 Check in was prompt, the desk people were very friendly and the rooms were ok.
__label__0 Husband and I were put in a room with two double beds(no kings available)
__label__0 Excellent central location made for a really good stay.
__label__0 It was wonderful.
__label__0 Yes, i know its a chain restaurant that you can find in a lot of different states, but something about the one in the French Quarter just tastes better.
__label__0 I liked the hotel as it was close to all that I wanted to see and do.
__label__0 It was in the mid-80s during the day and the 70s at night.
__label__0 I stayed for three nights at the Westin St Francis in the newer tower building.
__label__0 The hotel was remodeling the 6th floor
__label__0 This place is in a pretty excellent location really, right opposite the Zoo, specify a courtyard facing room if you want quiet,
__label__0 You have a bed, 2 night tables, a TV (flat screen), well stocked mini bar and a safe.
__label__0 and hotel construction noise started very early.
__label__0 Take a left when you exit the hotel and there is a wonderful bakery down the next street open early for freash breakfast.
__label__0 My biggest complaint was lack of service, employees looked overworked and unhappy, all areas looked understaffed.
__label__0 Each time I vist, they increasingly treat me like a king -- meeting me at my taxi/car whereupon four or five people greet me by name, escorting me to my ,always upgraded room, via private elevator.
__label__0 We stayed in a Business Suite.
__label__1 Almost forgot, it is even easier to find it when you arrive at Piazza Roma than the website says, and takes less than 10 minutes to walk even with a case.
__label__0 I booked online and got a great rate.
__label__0 the Hotel Warwick is a convenient, friendly and generally comfortable place to stay.
__label__0 Everything is within about a 5 minute walk of the Westin
__label__0 but I heard this is typical german,
__label__0 We often observed them singing to the background music.
__label__0 and you have to go through the lobby to get to it.
__label__0 Pool issue aside, there is a lot to like about this hotel.
__label__0 We booked this 4* hotel on the strength of the recommendations on trip advisor
__label__0 Typical hotel prices, although room service is around $2.00 per item more than the dining room, plus a 21% service charge and tax.
__label__0 We will be back each year to spend our anniversary with you.
__label__0 as for the wedding we met the wedding co-ordinator, Iveilesse, the following day and she covered every aspect of the wedding planning and more
__label__0 I was basically told because I booked through Hotwire, I wasn't a preferred customer!
__label__0 The staff wrote down in Chinese where we wanted to go and numbered each card so we simply handed the card to the taxi driver and off we went each day.
__label__0 The sole person who convinced me to not leave was one of the security guards.
__label__0 and the food was good.
__label__0 so I was off to a good start, but that soon ended.
__label__0 That said, Hotel Renew is a lovely addition to Waikiki Beach.
__label__0 We are the type to always make the best of a situation, so we did.
__label__0 it was really tiny and did not have a bathtub like I requested.
__label__0 This was our first stay at a Westin, and it was definitely very close to heaven.
__label__0 Here there were individual amenities, albeit cheap ones -- not luxurious by any means, robes, and the room just seemed genenally cleaner and brighter.
__label__0 The walkways are lined with brown outdoor style carpet.
__label__0 We never determined if it was the water and dampness in the room if we didnt leave our windows open ,our guess,, our someone in the courtyard with a deep love of boiled cabbage.
__label__0 The staff was extremely professional and courteous and bent over backwards to accommodate our requests.
__label__0 and I've got to say that it was in desperate need of an update (and I'm not picky).
__label__0 The hotel was remodeling, but it wasnt a bother at all.
__label__0 After a 30-45 min horseback ride there is a good one-hour hike through some VERY rugged terrain of narrow paths, steep hills and very rocky.
__label__0 wonderful wonderful hotel.
__label__0 We loved its location in Causeway Bay-a stones throw from the Causeway Bay MTR, great food outlets at Jardines Bazaar, good shopping at Times Square.
__label__0 The location is superb and having a tram stop 20metres away is a real bonus.
__label__0 and boy were we disappointed!
__label__0 Saw other guests who were also upset.
__label__1 Like others have already done so I would recommend Johns Cafe for breakfast and there is also a great 24 hour deli/store on the corner of 44th and 2nd.
__label__0 I visit San Francisco about twice a year.
__label__0 You can take the 100  200 buses which stop a block away from the hotel or just walk.
__label__0 Very nice hotel, but rooms are small and area is newer live/work type.
__label__0 just an amazing hotel just an amazing hotel.
__label__0 Restaurant was okay, drinks in lobby bar were very expensive.
__label__0 My husband and I just returned from Bahia Principe after spending 1 week from May 19th-May 26th.
__label__0 and they start very early!!
__label__0 We stayed in room 408 and it was great.
__label__0 small duty free in a cabin, I would definately stay at the sofitel again rather than risk a hotel in the wrong place which would seriously dent your enjoyment of a short stay
__label__0 I found this hotel to be a great base, I mean who needs a luxuary hotel, when youre going to be out all day and then just need somewhere to rest your head at night?
__label__1 But if you open your mind and realize you are experiencing how others live, you will love it.
__label__0 After arriving we were put in building #3.
__label__0 We normally go around this time every year and pay about $1500....so I guess you get what you pay for
__label__0 Hotel renovations are ongoing; the noise wasn't too bad on the weekend,
__label__0 Apparently the service can be a bit slow, but we were very well served there.
__label__0 On the other hand, there was a very tiresome muzac constantly being piped in the corridors.
__label__0 The breakfast is extra ,8.5euro,not a huge choice, 1 roll, 1 croissant each and some ham and cheese, tea and coffee etc.
__label__0 Over-all the trip was okay but a little disappointing.
__label__1 I would highly recommend an upgrade for that price.
__label__0 Great location, fantastic staff
__label__0 We gave up and returned the following day for the remainder of our stay.
__label__0 There was about 5 Gastapo power dressed receptionists manning the desk at the time,
__label__0 Taxis are readily available and the station is about a 10 minute walk away.
__label__0 When I sat in the cocktail lounge for a drink, I had to wait for ages to be served (along with several other tables).
__label__0 The Marinium tour where you snorkel with sharks/stingrays. 
__label__0 We final got checked in and they put us in a room between the ice machine and the elevator so it was noisy all the time.
__label__0 I try to book it every business trip to Sydney.
__label__0 Yet, being far enough away from the hectic activity of these places -- especially during this time of year -- made the hotel room a welcome refuge.
__label__0 We had asked for a pot of coffee to be delivered at 6am every morning, as we needed to be up and out by 7. On the third morning,
__label__1 Tip: if you want a beach chair at the beach or pool, go there before 9am or so and put your magazine or towel on your chair.
__label__0 The staff was friendly and tried to be accomodating, but couldn't give me a non-smoking room for the first night, nor an internal room,
__label__0 and I have to report that we were very satisfied with the Palace.
__label__0 Unfortunately, they only left 1 bathroom
__label__0 Again, I cant say enough about the staff, just fabulous people.
__label__0 We are not big drinkers, but do appreciate a well-made cocktail.
__label__0 There really aren't too many simple places to eat in the near vicinity unless you go to the food courts in one of the shopping centers nearby.
__label__0 There was an electric kettle in the rooms with cups, coffees, teas, sugar and creamer.
__label__0 The hotel is located near Outram Park.
__label__0 Close to Union Square
__label__0 Absolutely Fantastic - finally have found our Sydney Hotel
__label__0 The hotel has a laundry facility ,which is a great perk,, where guests can do their own laundry.
__label__1 Watch out where you park in Seattle.
__label__0 There is a great makeup mirror for the ladies that pops up from the bureau and you will find the blow dryer there.
__label__0 Fantastic The hotel was truly great.
__label__0 Staff extremely friendly and helpful.
__label__0 I thought the food was good and we enjoyed the open air cafe and the music at night.
__label__0 so they had given it to them and shafted us, and were lying.
__label__0 I have stayed at the hotel many times
__label__0 Coffee was luke warm and not a teabag in sight only various types of Twinings darjeeling.
__label__0 One restaurant open at 4:30 pm?
__label__0 Though clean the rooms are a bit bare,
__label__1 I would advise getting an inclusive deal or eating at one of the many local cafes which offered breakfast for a third of the price.
__label__0 My husband and I just returned from a 4-day weekend in Boston and had a great time.
__label__0 Staff at the Alex Plaza were unhelpful and had a 'couldn't care less' attitude.
__label__0 Youre right across the street from Dukes bar and the Mai Tai bar at the Royal Hawaiian
__label__0 Some staff were very nice and helpful
__label__0 On leaving the hotel, we took a cab to the Kowloon station to grab the airport train ,fast and cheap,.
__label__0 I would definitely stay here again.
__label__1 Dont expect a room with a view, and the hotel is on a fairly busy street, but they do have live jazz nightly.
__label__0 Location is great...there is a cheesecake factory right near the hotel,
__label__0 The room was on the small side but very clean and comfortable.
__label__0 The pineapples tasted nothing like the delicious pineapples we had in Kauai the week before.
__label__0 I called the hotel and asked why I wasn't called.
__label__0 Its a hotel you can feel welcome and at home at--Im convinced its one of the best buys in San Francisco.
__label__0 Ala cartes as well at buffets.
__label__0 'thank goodness I remembered my ear-plugs' I thought.
__label__1 I recommend adding the breakfast to the room charge, the buffet is varied and an excellent value.
__label__0 The hotel has a high standard: There is a good pianoplayer in the bar area at night.
__label__0 I stayed in an unrenovated room with a view out the window onto Fredrichstrasse.
__label__0 Front desk staff was exceptional.
__label__0 They have a small bar which serves drinks at a reasonable price.
__label__0 and that's the only place I'll stay next time.
__label__0 As expected Typical of this sort of hotel with rooms fitted and finished to a high standard, polite and attentive staff, good food, smart and spacious communal areas although these are beginning to look slightly dated now.
__label__0 The other times that we contacted front desk/guest services (very difficult to tell them apart) we were met by unhelpful  unknowledgable staff for very straightforward requests verging on the sarcastic and rude.
__label__0 so it is impossible to sleep on the fith
__label__1 Tip-join their members club ,free, via their website before you book, and then you truly get treated royally .i.e upgrade to suites, free calls, free welcome snacks, daily papers etc.
__label__0 Put the AC on high, but the room still felt like a sauna.
__label__0 So we cancelled the room before we found out that there was a huge convention in town that took over all the hotels in the area,
__label__0 We left our luggages at the front desk since the room reserved for us was still occupied.
__label__0 Only problem is that the Factory doesn't open for breakfast.
__label__0 Angry -yes.
__label__0 But it's clear that the Sheraton sheds all it's normal charges in order to make the rm price look cheap --
__label__0 Myself and spouse stayed at the Warwick Seattle for four days in September.
__label__0 They lost my reservation
__label__0 It was a very relaxing stay.
__label__0 Only a short walk from Time Sq and Central Perk ,ha,.
__label__0 I went to the front desk and asked the gentleman if there was some way to check on a refund due to health concerns regarding my asthma and my inability to stay in the room.
__label__0 but I suppose that is just me.
__label__0 Im planing my next vacation for next year.
__label__0 Poor First Impression
__label__0 It was extremely well insulated against noise;
__label__0 When I arrived there was no water for a few hours due to construction work.
__label__0 We had a very low rate of $89/night through Priceline with an upgrade to club for only $30/night.
__label__0 Mike said he'd help us out with the bill and find us another room so we decided to stay.
__label__0 Our overall experience was excellent, and I would highly recommend this hotel property, with one caution that I will address later in this review.
__label__0 All the tiles had been changed recently and the walls painted ,it still smelt of paint,.
__label__0 Although I would think they could stop it a little earlier in the evening.
__label__0 The spectalular fish tank in the foyer cannot be entered via the hotel- you have to go around several streets to enter it - at a fee.
__label__0 The main reception area and corridors stink of cigarette smoke as there is a table and chairs positioned along the corridor for smokers.
__label__1 For meat lovers, I would highly recommend the Brasilian.
__label__0 They quickly got our order through and explained there were unsure where our waiter went.
__label__0 PRINCIPEWe left for Punta Cana Dec 13 out of edmonton.....Concerning this resort I have no real complaints.
__label__0 though we arrived a few hours before the official check-in time.
__label__1 None of them appeared to be a concierge per se and noone offered to make us dinner reservations when asked about restaurants, so expect to take care of these details on your own.
__label__0 Building is impressive ,although dwarfed by surrounding financial HQs and the like, and about a 15 minute cab ride from the airport.
__label__0 Even after returning at 11 p.m. from a full day of sightseeing, you can walk over to the bar in the lobby and grab some complimentary water bottles.
__label__0 To top it all off, we were charged for 2 nights!
__label__0 Its right in the heart of the old East Berlin so every building in the area is communist in design, rectangular and not pretty and surrounded by busy main roads.
__label__0 We arrived at the hotel at 7pm
__label__0 Stayed for 3 nights and have mixed feelings about this hotel.
__label__0 The food was excellent.
__label__1 it is better to avoid the bar.
__label__0 Lovely room.
__label__0 Easy walking distance to shops, restaurants and historic sights.
__label__0 Not much of a view as all the surrounding buildings are the same height.
__label__0 one would figure, they would give the room a very good cleaning the next day - well, that didn't happen.
__label__0 Oeverall, it was a great experience and we are considering coming back to the Majestic.
__label__0 In fact, the hotel reeked of cigarettes.
__label__0 I like to come and go unnoticed as though I were walking into the front door of my own home.
__label__0 Within 5 minutes a hotel employee showed up with a can of bug spray and a rag and went to work.
__label__0 Arrived after a long journey and went to our room on the fourth floor.
__label__0 I must say it was great
__label__0 One other thing, I took my family to the eating establishment connected to this hotel and the service there was TERRIBLE
__label__0 it is close to the airport but you cant hear many airplanes.
__label__0 My wife and I spent 3 nights at the Palace Hotel in Berlin.
__label__0 The hotel staff was rude and acted like a bunch of premadonas.
__label__0 Apple had 2 reps on duty in the hotel lobby and, since they spoke excellent English, they could help us with some of the kinks we had with the hotel.
__label__0 Both are a block away.
__label__0 One thing we discovered very quickly that in Berlin the hotel you choose is all about location,
__label__0 Certainly one of... if not THE best hotels ever!
__label__0 Again, I was up early and I dont have a problem with rebuilding.
__label__0 and that breakfast was between 7-10,I put this down to me being tired
__label__0 and the management seemed to be hiding out in some alcove behind the desk.
__label__0 All in all an excellent hotel.
__label__0 We decided to priceline, got the rate we were looking for without the military discount and ended up at the Sheraton anyways!!!
__label__0 several design solutions were just very awkward.
__label__0 and the restaurant/bar is just a cordoned off section of the lobby.
__label__0 If we find some great cheap places we will share it with you.
__label__0 The carnival was in full swinging in Berlin, but not in this hotel.
__label__0 The room service was particularly good.
__label__0 There was 6 of us and he had no problem arranging transportation for our ride there.
__label__0 I was expecting something nice
__label__0 The bathroom was a nice size and had great amenities.
__label__0 While the room was a bit small, the bathroom was quite large.
__label__0 The location was great--close to Pikes Market and great shopping.
__label__0 The comforter and bedding, as well as the entire interior, were all standard Hilton - nothing to connote the southwest ,the comforter was a loudy itchy green floral print,.
__label__0 We kept the heater on to drone out the noise.
__label__0 My sister and I stayed at this resort from Apr 26 - May 2, this year, 2008.
__label__0 I thought this was a perfect level of hotel for people who just need simple, adequate accomodations.
__label__0 Swift check in, so far so good.
__label__0 I believe the lobby has free wireless,
__label__0 On Wednesday night, they serve lobster at the buffet.
__label__0 I again decided that I would be optimistic and hope for the best.
__label__0 Even thought the rate was reasonable our car was so dirty we could barely see out the windshield.
__label__0 Portions were huge and Im not sure any of us were able to finish.
__label__0 I stayed at the hotel a few weekends ago while in town to attend my granddaughters graduation from Loyola.
__label__0 Other problems that cropped up was that we bought some cakes
__label__0 The staff was very helpful, concierge was cheerful and patient.
__label__0 Part of the beauty of the Okura is that they *do* renovate it every few years - they just keep it the same way and I kind of like that.
__label__0 Only after I made it to the lobby was I offered help with the luggage.
__label__0 He lost everything in the storm.
__label__0 A breathtaking view by any standard.
__label__0 Wyndham - Great Location
__label__0 I felt I was staying at a **star hotel room.
__label__1 Meaning, dont expect your family of four to be comfortable in one room.
__label__0 All other major attraction is about 15mins away.
__label__0 By 9:00 the place was so crowded we were sitting on the couches to eat.
__label__0 It was explained that I was charged for items from the previous customer.
__label__0 The recommended local restaurants were excellent.
__label__0 Nice upper end place
__label__0  The Staff is simply outstanding.
__label__0 There is a $20 breakfast buffet that didn't look spectacular.
__label__0 Overall, I will stay Hotel Savoy again for my next Berlin trip for its location and service.
__label__0 and the staff have always been professional and courteous.
__label__0 Overall a good experience
__label__0 MISC Beach - Ocean / beach itself is beautiful.
__label__0 and not have to change the following day as our friends were due to arrive the next day.
__label__0 We moved to the second desk clerk when she was free and were told that our reservation could not be found.
__label__0 then I was told that there wasn't one,
__label__1 They will also drop you right off at your room if you ask.
__label__0 However, while the staff as a whole was great, there was a man on the desk ,name forgotten, that was condescending and a bit arrogant.
__label__0 and the furniture is really old and mismatched.
__label__0 shortly after that a young boy sliced his foot open
__label__0 Reception were able to book tours or transport and help with advice on what restaurants to try and what ones to avoid.
__label__0 Ideally located and a comfortable hotel.
__label__0 they will make any drink you want them too.
__label__0 We all did take a soak in that huge tub, though.
__label__0 Most importantly the room appeared clean and well maintained.
__label__0 and they let me print it for free in their business center.
__label__0 We were never given any apologies or signs of regret for the shortcomings we had to deal with.
__label__0 Perhaps the hotel will try to remove the nuisance at some stage - certainly staff seemed not to care.
__label__0 If you wanted lobster or shrimp you had to pay an additional $27.00.
__label__0 The room that they gave us looked out into the alley
__label__0 She said never in 20 years has it been on sourdough
__label__0 Nothing happened.
__label__0 and the tour agent booked this hotel.
__label__0 and we had a nice Space Needle view.
__label__0 The second day, we walked to the metro station ,about 10 minutes, and took the metro to Central Station, which took about 30 minutes.
__label__0 Can snorkel from the beach area.
__label__1 Bus #1 from the train station is most direct but #25 and #33 will get you there also.
__label__0 (and much worse!!)
__label__0 Stayed in the old tower 10th floor.
__label__0 Clean , tidy,very helpfull
__label__0 Unfortunately,.
__label__0 however, the tub facet dripped continuously.
__label__0 all the doors are warped
__label__0 Just about 3 blocks or so from the French Quarter and directly across the street from Harrahs Casino.
__label__0 Its right down the block from the train station, which is very helpful for lugging your luggage.
__label__0 The location is PERFECT.
__label__0 To get from the resort to the airport was about 30 miles and cost $80 dollars each way, but remember, youre still basically in the United States.
__label__0 I usually stay at a Starwood property like the W when in NYC, but this time I decided to go for a more personal experience.
__label__0 We arrived at noon and were in our room at 1.
__label__1 If you do not expect any kind of service whatsoever then go ahead and book these hotels but be sure what you are getting as they also have a third old building across the street which is a little more convenient than having to drag luggage three long blocks
__label__0 Quite expensive and service was mediocre.
__label__0 they told us it was too late to be moved as we had already checked in.
__label__0 and there was no fax.
__label__0 I think that towels were just refolded and replaced instead of giving new towels.
__label__0 Check-in service was quick and friendly.
__label__0 Yes, this was a big surprise to us.
__label__0 The rooms are very clean and up to date with there fixtures.
__label__0 The best part about this hotel is the front desk attendant Mary Jane.
__label__0 I was a little nervous because my room was right across from the elevators but once I got into my room and saw how big it was and the layout of the room, I knew I wouldnt be bothered by hallway noise.
__label__0 Plenty of pool area ,each tower has one and a Super pool in teh middle,, teh property sits ON the beach
__label__0 The clock radio was not a CD player and it didnt pick up one station.
__label__0 We were stuck there for over one hour after calling the hotel for assistance and having them tell use there was nothing they could do.
__label__0 At first a little apprehensive - website looks great, but a little out of the way in Mongkok.
__label__0 The hotel transfer was an additional $20 per person via the website.
__label__0 The staff is awesome.
__label__0 They said it was a congress like Berlinale or so.
__label__0 I do not know about the location and it did not really matter because taxis are readily available and very inexpensive.
__label__1 Negatives: Bed (if you are used to Sofitel beds from around there world don't stay here), bedding (old polyester), house keeping (on both morning the room was not properly cleaned and coffee and toiletry supplies were not replenished; the room was also not very clean with huge stains on the curtains), in room equipment (if you love 70s retro you will love the TV in the room).
__label__0 We didn't take the Hotel breakfast at 20 Eu each.
__label__0 We were told prior to getting to the hotel that our reservation had been honored, mind you we paid up front.
__label__0 We are very dissapointed.
__label__0 The location is perfect for bus and train station,and the water buses are right there.
__label__0 The hotel itself is a nice location and the rooms are ok but the staff sucks.
__label__0 but, as far as I'm concerned, getting some fluffier towels
__label__0 Upon check-in, I was shocked at the room we received -- very stripped-down.
__label__0 The front desk staff was very polite and helpful with me, but I did see them treat some older guests with a little disrespect.
__label__0 Also enjoyed fitness room and pool on top floor- Step-master while enjoying view of downtown with bay in distance...
__label__0 Great location, great rooms and great service
__label__1 The driver can take you from place to place, for a reasonable price.
__label__0 I would probably return, but opt for smaller rooms on the updated floors before going for the suite.
__label__0 A complete steal.
__label__0 We have stayed in several all-inclusive resorts that do deserve the rating.
__label__0 The staff is very helpful and friendly.
__label__0 and the pay-per-view movies which cost between $10 and $15 dollars each.
__label__0 The only thing that I didnt like was the birds that walked freely around the resturant.
__label__0 and they had no response.
__label__0 I do a lot of business traveling and found my recent stay at the Grand Hyatt in downtown Seattle to be among the best experiences in years.
__label__0 It has a nice lobby
__label__0 and at __�_13 overpriced as was the bottle of water strategically placed in the room at __�_4.50. All in all I have no real complaints about the hotel and would have no problems in recommending it.
__label__0 The Mark Hotel on Meineke Strasse is truly not a 3 star hotel.
__label__0 a soft drink was priced at 3Euro.
__label__0 It happend again once more at about the same time.
__label__0 and the only complaint we have is that the bath towels are very small,
__label__0 I used to really enjoy it,
__label__0 Ask for one that faces the interior.
__label__0 It started on the phone when I tried to get a room through Sheraton.
__label__0 The hotel was briefed ahead of time that we would be spending our honeymoon with them.
__label__0 We were blinded with the wonderful brochure and the webside about this Hotel Paradisus.
__label__0 The room was spacious and spotless.
__label__0 I want to mention specially the attention af the personell, specially Dilcia, Janet, Heidy and Donald at the front desk.
__label__0 p.s. this complaint has nothing to do with the hotel only the neighborhood,
__label__0 I'd stay there again.
__label__0 Even though this turned us off a bit ,again for people who dont mind a lil small talk this is no big, we decided that we would still like to come back beacause of the sheer beauty of the resort.
__label__0 Therefore we decided not to go diving.
__label__0 Tourist class accomodation but adequate.
__label__0 I was a little taken aback too when one of the bath towels that I wanted to use had 5 holes on it.
__label__0 Great air conditioning...and we needed it as it was very hot.
__label__0 The room was lovely; not as big or as posh as pictured, but I also hadnt reserved a suite.
__label__0 they told us to take a seat.
__label__0 The traffic noise was incredibly loud,
__label__0 The staff was helpful, friendly, and well-informed about the area.
__label__0 My husband and I received a gift to go for our honeymoon.
__label__1 Our room was beautiful and spacious and if you can afford it, I highly recommend the bigger room when staying with children.
__label__1 Waikiki is small and you can walk to the beach in a short time.
__label__0 They look exactly like the room we were in.
__label__1 Tip: pay in cash and have a Rick Steves book to get discounts.
__label__0 You either had to sit cross legged on the shower floor or stand up and use the shower by hand.
__label__0 The pool is incredible and the ocean was fantastic.
__label__0 Well I think that only added to the noise problem.
__label__0 I asked to move to another room and was told that all the nonsmoking rooms were booked.
__label__0 This was a big let dow for me,since I am used to having that,
__label__0 Also the location of the hotel is perfect.
__label__0 We were on vacation and in no hurry to do anything.
__label__0 Over rated and over priced.
__label__0 The situation is walking distance to tacky, tourist Hollywood Bvd.
__label__0 Hotel was in a great location.
__label__0 I might try the Seattle Sheraton after the construction
__label__0 Overall, we had a great time.
__label__0 As a Sofitel Privilege customer (their loyalty card scheme) the room did feature a welcome platter of fruit and some mineral water.
__label__0 Rooms are tiny and the housekeeping isnt there after 1pm, so if u came back late and wanted to sleep in ur room wont get cleaned that day.
__label__0 Really separate beds.
__label__1 Bring a Lan cable for your laptop in the room.
__label__0 When we arrived at the hotel after a full day of travel the desk clerk kept us waiting for several minutes without so much as a hello.
__label__0 Receptionist superb and really helpful.
__label__0 and the central reservations number because the people I dealt with firstly reserved me rooms on incorrect dates
__label__0 Service..No complaints here.
__label__0 There is a shortage of good local bars however but dont worry.
__label__0 He then said we did not need reservations at the third.
__label__0 And to find this fact out, we spoke with 4 different people.
__label__0 and the hotel was wonderful,
__label__0 It is nicely decorated, clean and comfortable and the staff were extremely polite and helpful.
__label__0 The lobby is pretty spartan,the desk clerk on duty pretty friendly-one guy in front of me at check inwas turned away as place was full-so book ahead.
__label__0 There arent enough to go around
__label__0 The spa was great, just what we needed after the hot weather we'd had.
__label__0 Good Value Hotel
__label__0 not a good place to get presents very costly, but nice.
__label__0 Excellent fitness room, though I did not use the spa/pool.
__label__0 No garbage cans to be seen around the beach.
__label__0 DVD with movies to borrow nice after a full day of sightseeing.
__label__0 We also asked if we could keep one room till about 1pm and check out from the other two rooms since our flight was at 5pm and we were planning to leave the hotel around 2pm.
__label__0 My second stay at the Grosser Kurf��__rst was as enjoyable as the first, a year ago.
__label__0 I did ask before hand to have a room in building #2 overlooking the pool.
__label__0 Front doors of rooms are old, not very energy efficient or sound proofed.
__label__0 We did not have breakfast at the hotel but opted to grab breads/pastries/coffee from the many food-outlets in the main stations.
__label__0 I skipped out, but only because we ran out of time.
__label__0 FOOD:There is only one main restaurant for buffet.
__label__0 I wasnt disappointed.
__label__0 The mark of a good hotel is its ability to deal with the unexpected and its ability to make guests feel at home.
__label__0 Spotlessly clean.
__label__0 For a hotel which is aspiring to great things this attitude is something fundamental which needs to be addressed.
__label__0 Our check in was done in the room, we never had to stop by the front desk.
__label__0 When we first checked in, we were given room 2403 ,Block 2, 4th floor, which is right by the front desk.
__label__0 although I still cannot quite believe they charge 11 Euros for a Sauna...
__label__0 Immediately they began to set up the room, adding a second bed in a VERY large room, overlooking the canal.
__label__0 We Will Stay Here Again. 
__label__0 Only a 10-15 minute stroll to Brandenburg gate  Reichstag down the beautiful Unter Den Linden.
__label__0 I couldn't believe it was so difficult to get a cup of coffee in SEATTLE!
__label__0 There are a couple sandwiches, some entrees including fish and steak, and appetizers.
__label__0 Location was good for walking.
__label__0 We LOVED it
__label__0 Note breakfast and 24-hours of Internet use were an extra 22 euro each.
__label__0 They recommended a nearby grocery store for late night sweets.
__label__0 We enjoyed breakfast at the hotel and the morning free coffee in the lobby.
__label__0 not much of a view.
__label__0 We would go back in an instant, worth the few extra bucks.
__label__0 Plenty of choice for breakfast.
__label__0 The lady at the frount desk admited they have been overbooking pepole for some time and that we are not the first to be in that problem.
__label__0 We ate out but I would imagine the meals in the restaurant would have been first class.
__label__0 The requested room was "garden view" away from the heavy traffic outside the hotel.
__label__0 When I got there they told me that I could only have three nights with an en suite
__label__0 There was also a small bar area with a minibar underneath.
__label__0 I came in around 5 p.m. on Friday night and checked in without any problems.
__label__0 stomping people above us, loud car and nightclub noise outside, etc., etc.,continental breakfast served from 7:30-9am ,never saw it - were on vacation - whos getting up and out that early on the weekend??,
__label__0 and I have always found the bathrooms to be in impeccable condition
__label__0 The hotel is advertised as being newly refurbished with luxurious rooms.
__label__0 Even though we booked directly through the Sheraton's website,
__label__0 I was surprised as one morning there was a wedding by the pool and the day before I saw a wedding too.
__label__1 The rooms are very clean and are the perfect base while exploring the city, ask for a room at the front of the hotel as you get your own personal little balcony.
__label__0 but I liked the nice big king-sized bed at the Marriott,
__label__0 pretty sleazy IMHO.
__label__0 a tale of good and bad
__label__0 State Convention Center this summer, and the Sheraton was in the best possible location.
__label__0 I had set up a package via Luxury Link
__label__0 We were lucky enough to be able to book the Romantic Package so got upgraded to terrace room, breakfast and one evening meal included and cava and chocolates on arrival.
__label__0 East Berlin centre is about 15 mins by taxi (there is a rank at the front of the hotel)The hotel itself is comfortable and well equipped with a very good range of spa treatments,
__label__0 My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton Seattle a few weeks ago.
__label__0 Our room was towards the back of the hotel, and the smell became evident the further back you walked.
__label__0 I booked this Sheraton hotel in downtown Seattle via Hotwire for two nights.
__label__0 Even the beds were top notch with plush pillow top mattresses, down comforters and large down pillows.
__label__0 I simply cannot express how beautiful the beach is.
__label__0 Basically the hotel had delibearatley overbooked and told us barefaced lies to cover up, knowing there was nothing we could do about it.
__label__0 A Hit with my Tech Teen
__label__0 I just want to say thanks to everyone that write on this site.
__label__0 ,There are only 2 of these suites and they take up the entire floor.,
__label__0 Only when we called the front desk in the morning did they instruct us to remove the wood paneling below the sink in the bathroom (which revealed all of the pipes, etc.) and manually turn down the radiator (which was on 5 - the highest level!).
__label__0 Say hello to him-their best employee
__label__0 At the time of our visit, the buffet, beach club and several restaurants were under renovation.
__label__0 We paid, for information, $2500 for 7 nights, two people, all-inclusive, air, Apple, a good deal/fair price in Americas winter.
__label__0 and I thought the location was perfect for us - close to Pikes Place market (can buy anything), the Waterfront (Bainbridge Ferry/shops, seafood restaraunts), Belltown (pubs/clubs), and the Monorail for a trip to the Space Needle area.
__label__0 This hotel is located just off the kurfurstendam str, which is the main shopping street in Berlin.
__label__0 The parking attendants in particular were very helpful with allowing us access to the garage if we needed to get to the car, but weren't going anywhere in it.
__label__0 Quiet, comfy bed.
__label__0 It's clean and the beds are good.
__label__0 This hotel is located in a very quiet district - barely a passing car on a weekday, completely dead at the weekendand with no local facilities.
__label__0 Just try it
__label__0 We had a beautiful room.
__label__0 Nothing Exciting Stayed here for one night before moving over to The Phoenician.
__label__0 It was o.k. for the money.
__label__0 This is on one hand customary, on the other hand I hope if I accidentally leave something behind,
__label__0 My daughter fell in love with the staff at the resort.
__label__0 These are old time diners which have become famous for their food.
__label__0 I would thoroughly recommend the hotel.
__label__0 The room, all mod cons, plasma, dvd, stereo, wireless keyboard for the internet ,chargeable,, quiet and reliable air con, nice window seat built into the ledge, reasonable min bar prices, pillow menu, slippers, gown etc.
__label__0 The casino there is a bit sketchy.....many of the machines were not functioning properly and the atmosphere was not pleasant....small is not even close.
__label__0 We still got club room amenities - the breakfast was great
__label__0 The Pool ended up being so dirty that the sides, above the water were black with grime
__label__0 and a towel had to be used to turn it off.
__label__0 Very good hotel
__label__0 He made sure I was happy.
__label__0 The bathroom was small but perfect with a powerful shower.
__label__0 We were on the 7th floor and could hear people talking on the street across from the hotel.
__label__0 I would definitely go back.
__label__0 The bed felt broken down and not anywhere near as comfortable as a Westin or Hilton bed.
__label__0 We will definitley stay here again.
__label__0 and he sent me down the wrong street.
__label__0 We couldnt hear the traffic.
__label__0 Overall, we were very pleased with our pick and would definitely stay there again.
__label__0 Situation: 2 blocks from the market and 2 blocks to the downtown shops.
__label__0 You had to take the funicular down to the marina and wait for the ferry to take you to the private island where the beach was.
__label__0 Great Hotel, Great location
__label__0 and my room smelled of smoke.
__label__0 However they were unable to locate the safe we apparantly had in our room!
__label__1 However, as I stated earlier, there are ample restaurants nearby from which you can choose.
__label__0 This time when we killed it it exploded with blood so it had obviously made a meal out of someone.
__label__0 Theres a Pizza Hut and Walgreens right across the street with many many restaurants up and down the main street in walking distance.
__label__0 We have never been disappointed.
__label__0 No atmosphere.
__label__0 I would go here if money were of no object (and not otherwise).
__label__0 Theres no scene at The Marseilles at night, but thats OK with so many other options all around.
__label__0 A huge decorated Cristmas tree and poinsettias in the lobby was enhanced by the deep red walls and wallpaper and crystal chandeliers.
__label__0 When complaints were put in about this absolutly nothing was done
__label__0 I asked the hotel where to buy the pillows.
__label__1 So, if you are not looking for service, unfriendly staff, basic facilities then I recommend you book this place!
__label__0 This was the perfect place to wind down after experiencing all the sights and sounds of Amsterdam.
__label__0 Had a great time.
__label__0 It smelled like mold and mildew.
__label__0 The rooms were very clean, and we had a beautiful view of the Hudson river from the 22nd floor.
__label__0 I called again because I was about to pass through Seattle.
__label__0 Neither was provided.
__label__0 but the children at all hours in the pool will drive you to the nudist spa area, which is pretty nice and child free.
__label__0 $487.
__label__0 The italian train system is cheap and v.reliable.
__label__0 The outer rooms are exposed brick and apparently ours was allowing moisture into the room.
__label__0 If you are lucky enough to be awarded the hotel through priceline it really is a fantastic bargain.
__label__0 What also bothered me was the fact there was a 3 euro surcharge for dialing a 800 number (so to use a phone card, you had to go to the Telefonzelle across the street.
__label__0 The breakfast had something for everybody (European and American breakfast foods).
__label__0 So we signed up for it, and lost signal right after that.
__label__0 No word about it on their webpage.
__label__0 Hasir restaurant on the corner of the street is very good.
__label__1 Be careful where you stay in this city.
__label__0 and there was a good selection of bathroom products.
__label__0 and the bed sheets showed lots of holes caused by cigarettes....
__label__0 The rooms are elegant and charming with the highest ceilings and the most wonderful hand carved doors.
__label__0 The pool area was a delightfully bright place to cool off on those hot Phoenix days.
__label__0 The swimming pool and gym were both excellent,
__label__0 Food was outstanding - everywhere.
__label__0 ,3, the hotel left us two bottles of plain water and two bottles of sparkling water every day, for free.
__label__0 The room I received was one of the larger suites,
__label__0 I ordered room service one day ,$28, ouch,,
__label__0 We decided that we would look on the bright side though and give the hotel a second chance.
__label__0 It also had some seaweed.
__label__0 though there aren't any parks very close by.
__label__0 Its location is perfect, overlooking a beautiful cathedral, the national palace, the ruins of the Aztec pyramids, and one of the largest squares in the world.
__label__0 but this was the guy I complained to so we probably got off on the wrong footing.
__label__0 After about 15 minutes we re-approached the receptionist as nobody came out to see us, and were told that there was nothing they could do, despite it being their error.
__label__0 This was not too miserable
__label__0 I booked the room to have a ocean view room, the first room did have a view but mostly of the hotel across the street.
__label__0 There's a cool lounge around the corner from the hotel called Vessel with great cocktails, music and interior.
__label__0 I have had much more consistent and better visits at Hiltons lately.
__label__0 It needs to decide whether it wants to be 'designer' or just a smart hostel.
__label__0 Moderate pricing and quiet location with parking, ,Fee $9 to $12,, yet still close to the Waikiki scene made it a good choice for us.
__label__0 It is a great location - close to North Beach, Union Square and Chinatown.
__label__0 We ate mostly at the buffet.
__label__0 My wife and I stayed for one night over this past Veterans Day/Rememberance Day weekend.
__label__0 Victoria Peak at night was an amazing view of the city.
__label__0 If you are looking for a smaller intimate hotel with excellent quality bedding and furniture and a warm, welcoming staff, this is the place for you.
__label__0 We didnt dine at the hotel, although we heard firsthand that there was one restaurant that was very slow in service ,main course took 2 hours,.
__label__0 They have a wonderful hot breakfast buffet that was included in our stay,
__label__0 Nothing special, but it was clean, big enough for two and decent private bathroom.
__label__0 I was hoping for something decent, and at first look I could not complain.
__label__0 The second night I was pulling down the covers and crawling around on my pillow were 2 BED BUGS!
__label__0 There was no luggage rack
__label__0 Two personal items of mine were taken from my room and again,
__label__0 no room service and prices for drinks were doubled in price.
__label__0 I booked a Deluxe Double Room.
__label__0 The guy I roomed with works in pest control and was a stickler about vermin bed bugs etc before we went and he had no complaints unlike some of our other guys who stayed elsewhere in the city so read into that what you will
__label__0 It is an old hotel, clean, the bathroom was in our room very small.
__label__0 All staff were so helpful, deluxe rooms incredibly spacious with the beds being the closest thing to heaven.
__label__0 The rooms were nicely furnished -- but be aware this is a country that is not highly accustomed to Americans perfectionist expectations.
__label__0 This made all the moving around worth it.
__label__0 Problem is, the fishy smell overpowered the lounge, and the elevator landing outside.
__label__0 We only had to take a cold shower one day and it gave us a good laugh.
__label__0 Also an easy walk to Pike Place market and the waterfront.
__label__0 Breakfast had to be queued for
__label__0 This is certainly a good hotel,
__label__1 Also, you must eat at Landrys.
__label__0 and the toilet was FILTHY!
__label__0 It's obvious that it attracts a younger crowd.
__label__0 Our hotel room was really not an improvement.
__label__0 The TV was really high up and awkward to see.
__label__0 I think I have stopped looking when it comes to New York.
__label__0 The beer was good.
__label__0 My boyfriend and I attended the Penny Arcade Expo in the Wash.
__label__0 The service, whether being given by the front desk attendant, housekeeper, mini-bar refiller, bartenders, waiters/waitresses, managers, porters, security personnel, or towel attendants, is exceptional.
__label__0 What respectable hotel, especially one with such expensive rooms, would have the gall to also charge lodging for their guests' cars?
__label__0 additional Hotel charge of 8 Euros that appeared on my credit card statement.
__label__0 They are huge but need a bit of freshening up.
__label__0 I was prepared for this as many of the reviewers have mentioned it, but still, it is unacceptable.
__label__0 and they took my name.
__label__0 I had no problems getting around by myself.
__label__0 At in Years This was one of my most relaxing vacations in years.
__label__0 People in our party asked for another room, because of the proximity to the elevator and twin beds (mentioned in the reservation) and were told very rudely that's the room we've given to you,
__label__0 The area is quiet and felt safe; rue Lavoisier is off Malherbes.
__label__0 I would avoid this place and would not go hear again.
__label__0 I did just that,
__label__0 This place is a nightmare!
__label__0 Very nice bar and restaurant/lounge area.
__label__0 It was fantastic.
__label__0 When we complained she said you were outside for about 5 minutes basically called us liars.
__label__0 it is a fairly typical four star hotel, without any features to really set it apart from the rest.
__label__1 Smokers beware: the hotel only has a few smoking rooms, all located on the second floor.
__label__1 Its also a great location if you love shopping because Nordstrom and Macys are right up the street as well as 2 big malls, Westlake Center and Pacific Place.
__label__0 We had to keep our dirty towels or go without.
__label__0 I have always like the location and was very impressed with the recent improvements.
__label__0 We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
__label__1 If you're looking for that famous Berlin nightlife, look elsewhere.
__label__0 From the greeting when we arrived to the help with getting to the train station and goodbyes when we left, it was a wonderful experience.
__label__0 We went up the space needle which my daughter loved!
__label__0 The lobby level has a coffee lounge that serves light snacks and is a nice gathering spot.
__label__0 Other reviewers have said what we would like to say.
__label__0 The place seemed a little run down and the staff was not friendly at all.
__label__0 They have these balconies, which are not meant for actually standing on, which were very drafty and made the room unbearably cold.
__label__0 The room was more than adequate for our needs.
__label__0 If you like to eat the same food all the time....go for it.
__label__0 The bathroom is tiny and old-fashioned but was fine for us.
__label__0 and even doubling up is not enough so sleeping for us was hard to achieve.
__label__0 Next time We will stay at the Camlin or one of the other real 4 Star hotels in the same area!!!!!!!!
__label__0 The location is great, in walking distance of the city center, with a bus stop nearby, should you have sore feet.
__label__0 There are some who seem to be just doing a job but this is compensated by the others who are the best.
__label__0 Our minibus which the hotel booked for us returning to the airport only cost 55 euros between 6 of us.
__label__0 You cannot go wrong.
__label__0 The shower was great- lots of pressure and no temperature fluctuations.
__label__0 Since we were not able to do so we remained at the Flamenco, where the next morning a note under our door informed us that more renovations were planned which interfered with the operation of the both the Mexican and the Italian restaurant.
__label__0 but the late night atmosphere for couples was romantic and welcoming - see as much as you can Berlin it is a lovely city - we will return - different hotel though!
__label__0 After a long travel day, our room wasnt ready when we arrived, and it took a little prompting on my part to speed up the process - which I shouldnt have to do.
__label__0 A la carte restaurants need reservations in advance and if the place is crowded you wont be able to get any reservation during the whole stay.
__label__0 and the staff shrugged their shoulders until a member of staff called Dave came to help us.
__label__0 For visiting sites in other areas of the city ,we loved visiting Frido Kahlos Blue House in Coyoacan,, the hotel will arrange for taxi service.
__label__0 The towels were so thin and coarse.
__label__1 I would definitely recommend this hotel.
__label__0 quite adequate for the price
__label__0 What a great example of classic service.
__label__0 I found that the photos posted on their site are pretty accurate.
__label__0 Bed was very comfortable.
__label__0 The room we were allocated was on the 5th floor, facing other buildings - not a view at all but lovely and quiet for sleeping.
__label__0 There were only two treadmills (one of which was broken), a Lifecycle bike, and four computerized weight machines.
__label__0 The Catalina across the street was a good spot for drinks and for breakfast.
__label__0 and not a single lock worked properly, took several minutes to lock the room.
__label__0 Fate!!
__label__0 Its only 60-80 HKD to the Wan Chai bars and central.
__label__0 We didnt eat at the restaurant, and it didnt look as though it received a lot of business.
__label__0 I also left a telephone message for him
__label__0 The following day my office tried to call and was told that we weren't staying there.
__label__0 They put us in a small room, with a horrible view.
__label__0 Good restaurant recommendations and knew where to find things, in general.
__label__0 Paul
__label__0 Loved the vibe of the hotel.
__label__0 So we changed the room.
__label__0 Lobby and location is perfect.
__label__0 The drain was slow
__label__0 though they gave it to my co-worker who called AFTER I did.
__label__0 Lovely Hotel Cannot speak highly enough of The London Bridge Hotel.
__label__0 This hotel does not disappoint as a reasonably priced stay in the downtown area.
__label__0 Valet parking was $35
__label__0 Italian - This was good.
__label__0 Directly across the street from an informal bus terminus the hotel is also very convenient for the U-Bahn into town and some points in the East on foot, but quite a walk away from the heart of things.
__label__0 I do wish that the staff were more accomodating.
__label__0 When we arrived ,close to 3pm, our room wasnt ready.
__label__0 Unusual ,and Very Good, Experience
__label__1 I think so - just keep an open mind and remember that the mentality is very different from what you may be used to.
__label__0 Final note, FOR THE MONEY ,$159/nt, and the fact that its right across the road from the main beach, its a decent value for a nice location.
__label__0 and we chose to stay directly at the hotel for the latter part of the conference.
__label__0 The resort staff told us the local golf course was terrible.
__label__0 The location is perfect, the staff are mostly fantastic.
__label__0 Best breakfast place we found (but there are many) was in Fasanenstrasse No.
__label__0 the hotel has the feel of a traditional hotel.
__label__0 Hotel location is excellent - walking distance from Bloomingdales, Central Park and subway stations.
__label__0 Location is fine, place is clean, and no problems with the bathroom, but oh that postage-stamp bed for two ...
__label__0 I asked why the air conditioning was not on, and was told they turn it off during this time of the year.
__label__0 This made for VERY long waits to move between the 5 guest room floors, the lobby, and the two levels of the parking garage.
__label__1 We will definately be returning, and recommending it to anyone we know is intending to visit Venice.
__label__0 It should be ashamed to call its self a Best Western.
__label__0 When we got to our room, we went to use the bathroom
__label__0 We checked out the pool
__label__0 I studied in Florence, so the pressure was on.
__label__0 The room and bathroom were big - for Europe.
__label__0 We considered this cost, though fairly staggering for us, to be worth it.
__label__0 The hotel was situated in a seedy part of town.
__label__0 The only problem we had was one room had a very loud buzzing during the night ,room 505, apparently it was to do with it being above the restaurant, however as soon as we mentioned it to reception, we were immediately moved without fuss to a suite
__label__0 A cab to SoBe was $30 and if youre staying at the M.O. then this is a small price to pay.
__label__0 The double glazing kept out all noise, and the shutters were excellent too.
__label__0 Horrible - absolutely horrible.
__label__0 Warning, they falsely charged my CC WARNING
__label__0 The hotels location is second to none you have the Empire state, 5th Avenue, Grand Central, Chrysler Building, Times Square etc all within a few minute walk.
__label__0 Fabulous, Friendly Hotel
__label__0 It was nine couples all together.
__label__0 I had to give her the url and number of the place to call.
__label__1 All very good - only dont expect to be waited on .
__label__0 you will not be disappointed.
__label__1 Things to bring ,aside from the obvious, - Antibacterial hand soap for your room, spray air freshner, an alarm clock ,or just a clock as they do no have them in any of the rooms,, Cortizone ,for heat rashes,, Benadryl ,to stop the itching from heat rash...lol,, face cloths ,we got these one day and never saw them again,.
__label__0 I call the desk again and voice my displeasure and request a new room, which they take care of in about 30 minutes.
__label__0 We called the front desk several times about this and nothing was done.
__label__0 It feels like you are staying at a friends home where they are glad to see you and want you to love their home and city
__label__0 My boyfriend and I stayed here from Sept 2-5. We usually stay at the Springhill Suites Marriott, but decided to go the budget route.
__label__0 The staff at the hotel were extremely helpful and courteous.
__label__0 The bartender just adds liquor to it and here you go.
__label__0 I will probably want to check out a different hotel the next time I am in Seattle.
__label__0 This is, by far, the worst customer service experiences we've EVER had.
__label__0 The price was jacked up for the Christmas holiday, but you only live once
__label__0 During our stay, we were able to obtain reservations for only two dinners.
__label__0 Otherwise, there are no outlets in the bathroom.
__label__0 Although the rooms are modern,
__label__0 Beautiful, well-laid out, albeiit small rooms.
__label__0 Great Staff nice reception hour and excellent service.
__label__0 It was expensive (parking is $35/night)
__label__0 The hotel is extra clean, and they do everything to make your stay pleasent.
__label__0 This gives the impression of it being dirty as soon a you walk in.
__label__0 The waiter brought eggs and bacon instead.
__label__0 I had read that the street was a bit noisy,
__label__0 When I called to ask about it, I was told that the was not the case and that the internet website does not have a second tv listed for the one bedroom suite....and low and behold...it does.
__label__0 Overall, the stay at Berlin Mitte was not what I expected from a hotel chain which calls its most basic room 'Superior'.
__label__0 There was a small living room off of the master bedroom with a single pull-out sofa bed with tv the works as well.
__label__0 Stayed at the Barcelo Dominican Beach from Dec. 8 to 15 and had a pretty good time.
__label__0 There are many other quality hotels in all aspects for near that price.
__label__0 We had a family suite for 3 adults - it was huge, comfortable and clean.
__label__0 we were there with family
__label__0 I booked a room at the Moore for two weekend nights thinking I would get one with a shared bathroom.
__label__0 We just spent a night in this hotel and it deserves a higher ranking
__label__0 I have to agree with most of the other reviews on this property.
__label__0 Top tip: if you fly in
__label__0 But the worst thing was the indoor noise.
__label__0 And one last thing; there are no tea/coffee facillities in the room.
__label__0 It was a memorable stay from beginning to end and surely we will come again
__label__0 I will certainly stay here again when I pass through.
__label__0 Another guest was complaining about another issue at the same time, so it wasnt the best introduction.
__label__0 We found the hotel on Tripadvisor and advised our travel agent to book.
__label__1 There are several better hotels nearby who appreciate your business and will work with you.
__label__0 The location of the hotel is very spectacular surrounded by rice terraces and overlooking a river gorge.
__label__0 She said that we could go diving through a different dive shop that is 30 minutes away.
__label__0 Returning to the room I was disappointed again to find that our insect infestation problem was not addressed.
__label__1 Avoid the double decker Gray Line tour.
__label__0 As far as the bathroom and sheets everything is perfectly clean.
__label__0 and this was our first trip to berlin.
__label__0 Also it was verrry HOT.
__label__1 They do serve drinks upon request in the lobby and you better ask them to do so.
__label__0 Updated ,meaning decor, not renovated really,Nice decor, fun, floralSmall refrigerator in the roomOne Valet and One Front Desk clerk were super
__label__0 Would I stay there again, yes
__label__0 The hotel is well place in the city, with a U-Bahn station right outside the door;
__label__1 Anyone looking for something a little bit special should look elsewhere,
__label__0 I asked at the reception if a fan was available so that I could shut the window but this request met with a very hostile "NO,
__label__0 Great location - plenty to see, and good train/tube connections.
__label__0 Bathtop curtain was to short and the bathroom was allways flooded after taking a shower.
__label__0 The hotel is small and so are the rooms, but everything is comfortable.
__label__0 Not likely any time soon.
__label__0 Im guessing this is one of best accomadations near Esperanza for this price range.
__label__0 Buffet breakfast is very extensive.
__label__0 The next day that problem already occured at 8!
__label__0 It is wonderful.
__label__0 walls are made of paper,
__label__0 When I went to the desk to hand in my certificate, both the associate and manager told me I had to call in advance and that the certificate ,a print out from the Marriott Rewards Platinum page that says PRINT THIS PAGE AND SURRENDER, was no good since it wasnt the certificate.
__label__0 Comprehensive gym in the basement.
__label__0 Location is quiet but the U bahn station is not on a main line
__label__0 My room was number 9 and was really quiet.
__label__0 The heater roared loudly,
__label__0 By the way, I read somewhere that the place was overcrowded with locals paying only a small daily fee to get in.
__label__0 We were very close tothe French Quarter but in quiet area.
__label__0 I cant believe that people in FEMA trailers have to pay rent on the space for the trailer.
__label__0 Just the bath tub and the sinks got cleaned, the mirror, glass partition, tiles were very obviously not.
__label__0 This is initially why I booked with them.
__label__0 The cava at reception is a nice touch though we had to ask for a glass ,?,
__label__0 In spite of the fact that the reservation we made through the Starwood Hotels website said our rooms would have Westin's renowned Heavenly Beds, we found that only a few suites actually have the beds.
__label__0 I've now resolved the issue and am just hoping that my actual stay will prove less stressful than the reservations process.
__label__0 My two sisters and I get together once a year or so to have a fun NYC weekend, and its important for us to stay together.
__label__0 Basic, but comfortable, accomodations in a great location
__label__0 This place has it all - great spa casino and pool.
__label__0 Shopping was a bit pricey compared to shops a half mile away but boy was the stuff nice
__label__0 Renovated?
__label__1 and the price virtually the same if you were considering a private room at HI.
__label__0 Deluxe room was big with a good view (18th floor).
__label__0 Many of the buildings in the French Quarter are very run down do to their age.
__label__0 There is a coffeemaker in the room, a nice hairdryer, iron and ironing board and a safe in the closet.
__label__0 The hotel staff was pleasant and extremely helpful.
__label__1 Choose to go to the specialty resturants on other nights.
__label__0 I was first given room #1, very dark and damp, had a basement feel since it was on the ground floor half buried in dirt.
__label__0 My alarm bells did not ring then....The fouth morning the bed was covered with bedbuggs and they had eaten me all over.
__label__0 Trips: Only took one trip...Saona Island...This island is breathtaking...a must see.
__label__1 Must see Getty Centre and the Grove shopping road.
__label__0 Just returned from a 6 night business trip to Seattle, and enjoyed staying at the Andra.
__label__0 Check in was a breeze however, I was initially given a smelly, smoked -in room facing the river.
__label__0 We had looked to pay for an upgraded to the executive floor
__label__0 The shared bath was a little uncomfortable to use.
__label__1 Just fill out the card with the time slot you wish your breakfast to arrive at your room.
__label__0 We went to the Supreme, one of the resorts buffet restaurants.
__label__0 1st Time at the Nikko
__label__0 Most lines were 1-3 blocks away.
__label__0 We stayed here for two nights on the recommendation of others on trip advisor.
__label__0 We had to call every morning for our breakfast and twice one morning.
__label__1 If you have a choice DONT STAY HERE.
__label__0 It was maintained very well.
__label__0 I usually leave a decent tip everyday with a Thank you note in the room for the maid when I stay in a hotel.
__label__0 Our first room had a small kitchenette, the second did not -- here, a micro wave and a small fridge would have been welcome.
__label__0 Staff: Yeah, the check-in person was aloof ,a young guy, obviously not viewing this as a big career break or anything,, but every single other person we encountered was polite, helpful and smiling.
__label__0 Decided at 1am one night to visit Paris for a couple of days, searched and booked 10hrs later through boookings, finding a room ready and just sufficient to sleep a family of 4 with 2 children under 5 a few hours later.
__label__0 The duty manager spoke to me in person and advised me to go to my room whilst he sorted this out within 5 minutes I was on the phone to the hotels sub contracted doctor who advised me to travel to see him as it would be quicker and cheaper.
__label__0 and the mini bar bottled water was $4. The location is perfect because it's so close to Pike Place market, downtown shopping and the great restaurants in Belltown.
__label__1 You can catch the monorail a block from the hotel if you want to visit the Seattle Center.
__label__0 Reservations were made via call to Personalities Hotels- all went off without a hitch.
__label__0 The value was brillant- room BB per night was 99euro- a bargain.
__label__0 I got mine from Bookings, which had the advantage of not taking all your money up front on a no cancel deal (like some of the others try to do...) Hotel is well placed for Shopping, busses and U S Bahn lines.
__label__0 My wife and i stayed at the Astor Crowne Plaza in August 2007 for 2 nights.
__label__0 The room was small with no view.
__label__0 but this seems like the only good thing about it.
__label__0 The room was very noisy.
__label__0 I would recommend this resort .
__label__0 This is one hotel I could just sit in the hotel room and never leave.
__label__0 My colleagues and I stayed all over the Union Square area, and my experience at the Bijou was the most positive of our group who tried the botique hotels.
__label__0 Just Right This hotel is in the perfect location, especially for the touristy traveler.
__label__0 Nice staff too.
__label__0 While there, a hurricane came through.
__label__0 The staff are exceptional and the location is as good as it gets - one min walk from Union Square.
__label__0 The German staff was attentive to our requests without exception.
__label__1 Dont go for the pictures on the starwood internet site.
__label__0 I stayed here along with a friend for more than 20 days and the behaviour of the guys at the reception was terrible.
__label__0 Very nice man.
__label__0 The price was very reasonable and included daily buffet breakfast and wireless internet access.
__label__0 so I can't blame the hotel for that.
__label__0 Kind and Considerate
__label__0 This property is undergoing an expansion, so construction noise was also a problem.
__label__0 The rooms had modern decor and were far more than adequate.
__label__0 The staff, however, left more to be desired.
__label__0 I have seen better.
__label__0 We rarely ever had hot water and everytime I called for help they told me theyre having problems with the steam.
__label__0 Bottom line is I will never return to this resort simply because management did nothing to correct this problem.
__label__0 I don't recall Expedia (with whom I booked) asking if I wanted a smoking or non-smoking room, so I felt I didn't have arguments to change.
__label__0 Good vacation for the money.
__label__0 When I approached the front desk, I was warmly greeted and notified that we were already pre-checked in; handed our room key; and offered some afternoon hot chocolate and fresh fruit in the lobby.
__label__0 Location was very central
__label__0 Which I did at 6.30 the next morning [I arrived at the Moore at 10 pm too late to find somewhere else].
__label__0 We would have asked to be placed in another room if our schedule would have permitted.
__label__0 We watched numerous people turned away, one on crutches, because their reservation was lost in a snafu.
__label__0 No extra bedding for the night because it was sometimes cool.
__label__0 All it was promised to be, rooms were spacious, beds were great.
__label__0 No bathrobes or slippers, no mineral water, no CD player, one towel per guest per day, no turn-down service, and poor quality toiletries and absence of simple items such as cotton buds, nail files and hair conditioner.
__label__0 We retrurned to the Berlin Mark Hotel on Meineke Strasse to plead our case that we we were under the impression that we had booked that hotel and wanted to be there for the four nights
__label__0 We walked all over town from here.
__label__0 The room given to us was on the first floor.
__label__0 Not once during our stay were we able to enjoy a hot meal from the buffet.
__label__0 I went with my daughter and my 2 grandsons.
__label__0 One needs to swipe ones room cards in order to access the floor rooms.
__label__0 Only drawback was the extra charge for in-room internet.
__label__0 It is in need of a serious upgrade.
__label__0 Since we were tired, we ordered rooms service.
__label__0 This hotel reminds me of an old New York hotel.
__label__0 During our time in the States we had stayed at other more basic hotels which offered free wifi in rooms.
__label__0 Beaches are monopolized by beach huts and restaurants, so dont expect a room right on the water.
__label__0 Although the reception and bar area is below your window you cannot hear a single sound as the very thick,
__label__0 but the service desk quickly fix that error and offered my a free movie.
__label__0 Stayed in this hotel over New Year for the past 2 years.
__label__0 and bathroom was typical smallish hotel fare.
__label__0 With all this said, we did have a good time.
__label__0 My cab driver had just gotten his tax the day before.
__label__0 My wife and I stayed in the Agon Alexanderplatz for 3 nights for a long weekend break
__label__0 The bathroom was sufficient and for the most part clean.
__label__0 The Best in NYC:
__label__0 Room size is average.
__label__0 it is located a 10 minute walk to the mtero system and close to major streets so that you can take the buses if you are brave enough.
__label__1 SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO ELSEWHERE.
__label__0 It is well priced for canadians who are spending candadian dollars.
__label__1 The only seating times available are 6pm or 8pm but if you show up after 9:30pm at any of the restaurants they will just seat you.
__label__0 but in the evenings these are pitch black.
__label__0 We really enjoyed our stay here and would definitely stay again.
__label__0 We arrived early, in the rain, and came to the wrong entrance.
__label__0 Gorgeous Hotel, Amazing View, A Little
__label__0 I had read some of the comments posted here before going and was kind of dreading what I might find.
__label__0 Unfortunately the hotel does not offer a pillow service and has no alternative to the ones in the room (I asked and failed).
__label__0 Loved Extase coffee shop, people in Amsterdam were so so friendly I cant begin to say enough
__label__0 All in all, nothing to write home about.
__label__0 We stayed there for 3 nights late December 2003.
__label__0 Brekfast is plentiful but very basic.
__label__0 I was having about 5 glasses per day toward the end of the second week.
__label__0 The Warwick is located in Belltown, an interesting neighborhood with some fabulous restaurants.
__label__0 The breakfast buffet is the closest thing to an American breakfast on the Left Bank.
__label__0 I'm confident that we couldn't have found a better boutique hotel for a better price.
__label__0 We tried the pool to relax ouserselves
__label__0 The Potsdammer Platz is very times square with it's glass and steel highrises and heavy traffic.
__label__0 Really nice hotel.
__label__0 The rest of the room was OK - typical decor, above average bed, decent view of the city from our 20th floor room.
__label__0 A fantastic hotel.
__label__0 They could use a little polishing up and professional conversational skills.
__label__0 After I checked in, I went down to the fitness room for a quick workout and found it to be really nicely equipped.
__label__0 I just recently stayed at the Paradisus Palma Real
__label__0 I was spoiled by the room and amenities at the Alexis,
__label__0 I tried to air out the room,but the noise from the street down below made it unbearable to get a good night's sleep.
__label__0 The rooms themselves are comfortable, but a little on the older side.
__label__0 Convenient, solid, would stay again
__label__0 The views from the room were amazing ,even thought it was of a city,.
__label__0 It is a small hotel, so it felt cozy and not as impersonal as a larger chain-type hotel.
__label__0 However, we liked the bar quite a bit.
__label__0 Swim up bar fantastic, beach is beautiful and on and on.
__label__0 and we couldn't get it quite cool enough for comfort, (3) Rather thin towels for a luxury hotel, (4) Needless step to the beds; great for tripping on (especially for an older person such as my mother).
__label__0 The hotel is well located within the downtown core
__label__0 Tried the spa- which has everything .
__label__0 Desk staff was friendly and very helpful at booking tours and providing directions.
__label__0 The Ilikai also permanently closed one of their two pools because the adjacent ,Yacht Harbor, tower was sold to another company.
__label__0 but I still think it's too high.
__label__0 and it took 12 hours to get a key to it.
__label__0 bathrooms are really nice marble and glass.
__label__0 They charge $30 an hour and it is worth it.
__label__0 The bar is quite small but serves everything you need at usual hotel prices.
__label__0 As stated in other reviews, the location is on the (slightly tourist) bus line 200 and a 5 minute walk to Ku'damm, and 10 minutes to the Zoo Garten Train station.
__label__1 and I was woken by the early morning firing up of the local bus service (a courtyard-facing room is essential unless you have industrial strength earplugs.)The rooms are small and ill-conceived.
__label__0 and the room had not been very thoroughly cleaned.
__label__0 At first, we were worried, since we were not impressed by the large buffet at the Grand Palladium.
__label__0 It was larger, cleaner and updated (though the washroom was clearly not renovated, as I've noted in my pictures).
__label__0 The Bad: Front desk disorganized ,where do the lines begin??,
__label__0 Great location and breakfast
__label__0 My husband and I ,both 30 years old, stayed at the Barcelo Dominican Beach from May 31 - June 7, 2008.
__label__0 Room was quiet and clean.
__label__0 The staff said I need to pay at least 5000 yens to change to another deluxe room for better view.
__label__0 Since I was working remotely
__label__0 Yes the pool is small but the last thing i want to do at a hotel is sit around a pool with a lot of people.
__label__0 Well, let me just say that I have a great time at the Outrigger.
__label__0 They will match or beat the best online rate.
__label__1 They wanted over $300 for 4 days, and we ended up renting at Enterprise for about $125 insurance included , after driving in Puerto Rico I highly recommend taking there insurance,.
__label__0 NOT ACCEPTABLE.
__label__0 And the price was very reasonable, considering the quality of the place.
__label__0 He took care of the reservations and found us another place to eat that evening.
__label__1 I guess the bottom line is that if you are a diver and plan to dive, I would not stay there.
__label__0 We were a little disappointed when we found out that the hotel that accepted our bid was the Sheraton.
__label__0 It was early in the day, he said the first two would not be open, but would make the reservations later and noted it on the computer.
__label__0 You can't beat the Sheraton on 6th Avenue in Seattle for proximity to all things downtown.
__label__0 My only major beef was the $21 for nightly parking which was a blatant rip-off considering they only charge $8 to park all-day.
__label__0 The pool which goes up and down the length of the resort is so big that at times you feel like it is your own pool.
__label__0 It's just a few blocks walk to the Pike Place market, the water front.
__label__1 There are some cons about this hotel - REMEMBER - if you drive down your parking is NOT FREE
__label__0 While the location is great, this one is a bust.
__label__0 It is the only 2-day tour you can get on and off the trolley at the different stops.
__label__1 So, be sure to tell them in advance if noise bothers you.
__label__0 When we arrived back at the hotel we had to wait outside for about an hour and a half because the lady at the front desk did not buzz us in.
__label__0 I nod off into a fitful sleep.
__label__0 The entry hall was all marble, as were the two flights of stairs you had to climb to get to our suite.
__label__0 but the request seemed to confuse everyone.
__label__0 It had all the usual, egg, bacon, cheeses etc but no smoked salmon and was not great for a 4 star hotel.
__label__0 Comfortable, friendly hotel
__label__0 We choose to stay at HI Exp when we can because they are reasonably priced and include a substantial breakfast and you know exactly what youre going to get because the quality of the hotels are all very similar.
__label__1 Avoid the first floor and you will be fine.
__label__0 and the decision was primarily based on cost and the reviews listed here.
__label__0 We have stayed in numerous hotels before and more than half did not give us connecting rooms.
__label__0 I cant understand why they dont just hand these out to visitors.
__label__0 One thing I didn't realize until the end of my stay was that there is a grocery store just down the street,
__label__0 I wish I had read reviews on this site prior to booking.
__label__0 Needless to say, I don't think that we will be staying at the Sharaton any time soon.
__label__0 Rooms in punta cana dont really have views.
__label__0 Otherwise the rest of the pool had dark dirt stains covering the bottom and sides.
__label__0 The location was great for all the sights of New Orleans.
__label__1 Walking to the shops, you may want to mentally prepare yourself for the abuse you will take from the local shop owners,aka vultures, that will swoop down upon you to practically drag you into their shops.
__label__0 We stayed at this resort for 8 days and had a wonderful time.
__label__0 The Chef is actually a member of the Royal Thai family, in line for the throne
__label__0 At $279 a night, I expect more.
__label__0 Perfect hotel for the active traveler who enjoys a very active day in the island outside of the property and just wants a nice and clean room to rest.
__label__0 Overall Good Value for the Money
__label__0 Problem #2 when I went to turn on the AC I noticed that there where ants crawling on top of the unit.
__label__0 Nice but expensive hotel, shame about the location
__label__0 Explanation given was the cleaning staff are Chinese and do not speak either English or German so they could not guarantee the problem could be resolved.
__label__0 Travelled with three children
__label__0 We accepted it, and was glad we did since I saw a regular room later on and it was tiny.
__label__0 There were plenty of choices and I especially enjoyed the seafood - calamari, grouper, salmon, shrimp, were really good.
__label__0 and there was a large walk-in closet.
__label__0 Evidently Leo Dicaprios favorite haunt when he stays in New York.
__label__0 Okay, this is NOT a glam hotel,
__label__0 Location was not ideal although in any big city no location is ideal for everywhere anyway.
__label__0 Bathroom was well-sized, lots of hot water and great pressure.
__label__0 Tucked into a quiet neighborhood, the 10 minute walk to and from the hotel each day through the gorgeous Vondel Park provided us with a very scenic and peaceful way to begin and end each of our days.
__label__0 The Spa was top notch, the restaurants were basically the same as any other resort actually better i.e. Sandals, etc.
__label__0 Furthermore, the glass half-wall glued to the bathtub was inadequate when showering, with lots of water on the floor as a result.
__label__0 Wouldnt Hesitate to Return
__label__0 Many nights, our room was not cleaned until 6 and 7 PM.
__label__0 We were in Gravina II which I think might be a newer section on the 5th floor.
__label__0 The bath is finished in marble with a deep tub
__label__0 Of course, if you plan to be at the beach or out touring all day, then the noise is not a problem.
__label__0 No one told us the gym was closed.
__label__0 I was a little dubious about this hotel after reading some of the reviews
__label__0 Note, the room can only accommodate two people who are close
__label__0 Leaving your bedroom window open is not an option as my heavily bitten body will testify!
__label__0 The service was very welcoming, the bars were really busy and the wait for drinks took a little longer, but we were not disappointed waiting a few extra minutes for our drinks.
__label__0 Travel these days can bring an untold amount of unpleasant surprises.
__label__0 WAYYY better than my runny eggs and 4EUro Coke at the hotel.
__label__0 They offered to bring an extra cot.
__label__0 The next morning we saw another bed bug crawling around on the wall next to the bed we just slept in.
__label__1 Whatever you do, don't stay at this hotel.
__label__0 I would have found somewhere else to stay if I had the funds
__label__0 but seemly our room did not have.
__label__0 The mattress felt more like a water bed than a spring one
__label__0 Refused to notify guests
__label__0 The decor of the hotels public spaces and rooms is modern and sleek, featuring dark woods, light-colored walls, tile and marble bathrooms, and adjustable mood lighting.
__label__0 Very, very dissapointed.
__label__0 Everything about the hotel was good,
__label__0 I had read many complaints on this site, and though I saw many negative ones, I figured no matter what I would keep a positive outlook.
__label__0 and strangely enough there was no porter available to help us with the luggage.
__label__0 and that we should take a taxi.
__label__0 K'damn is just across the road, as is the Berlin zoo on the opposite side.
__label__0 It reminded me of a few apartments I had right out of college.
__label__0 This might have been the only hotel Ive ever stayed at where housekeeping didnt rudely wake me up at 8am.
__label__0 We had a plasma in our king room
__label__0 Cant commend the staff highly enough including the General Manager Greg, during this difficult time.
__label__0 You will not want to leave.
__label__0 rooms were in need of repair.
__label__0 We found a nice big room, with a comfortable bed, new linens, very clean and modern bathroom.
__label__0 There were several stains on the carpet and furniture.
__label__1 Stay elsewhere if at all possible.
__label__0 Excellent customer care and the quality and response time for room service is commendable.
__label__0 We found this to be the case in a very special way.
__label__0 I really liked the new Bliss Mandarin Mint bath products.
__label__0 We had a room facing out towards the aquarium - it's beautiful to look at the fish from your balcony at night.
__label__0 There are three computers near check-in desk that are available to guests 24/7, that was very much appreciated.
__label__0 Being on the first floor we could not leave the balcony door or window open as anyone could potentially climb in if they wanted to make an effort.
__label__0 No manners, and I can't recommend this hotel as a great five-star.
__label__0 Instead I got a family room facing a noisy street and a tiny shower.
__label__0 Be prepared that most Berlin hotels do NOT have air conditioning!
__label__0 They offeryou a choice of pillows - a neck roll, a spelt pillow, a hot water bottle - they encourage you to ask for them and that really made the trip special.
__label__0 and just like the pool it was filthy.
__label__0 I decided that Mr. Sims would change his tune when he was confronted with this issue in person, and in front of other guests....I was wrong.
__label__0 I was under the impression that ALL beds were the so called Heavenly bed
__label__0 and the old is 2 star.
__label__0 but if paying rack rate there are other hotels with far superior facilities available in Berlin
__label__0 first come, first served basis at breakfast.
__label__0 Unfortunately this establishment falls a bit short.
__label__0 They also have business services and currency exchange and a Starbucks on the ground floor areas.
__label__0 The food was mediocre and the selection is small ,compared to other resorts we have been to,.
__label__0 You will find a lot of Germans, French, and Spaniards visiting this resort.
__label__0 The room is average looking, with motel style bedspread and decrative pillows.
__label__0 Breakfast wasnt to good, and the rooms could do with some updating.
__label__0 I called the hotel immediately.
__label__0 Then one night we returned about 1:30 AM to crash and our neighbor left on his music really loud.
__label__0 The room was very small with an even smaller bathroom,although it had just been refurbished, the air-con unit would blow out air, but not very cold air and therefore never switched off.
__label__0 The hotel doesn't have a shuttle so the only other option was a cab which is about $30.The hotel restaurant is adequate
__label__0 The tourist card ,$10 on entry, and departure tax ,$20, was included in the WestJet vacation package.
__label__0 but once again we were greeted with the confusion and mess of construction.
__label__0 However, those are the only positives.
__label__0 The staff tend to be young and inexperienced.
__label__1 Should you be driving: Reasonably well located, near to the outer peripheral road , just watch out which exit you take from Place de Nation...,.
__label__0 We found the staff to be friendly and plenty of activities for everyone in our group to enjoy.
__label__0 The resorts on either side of us must have completely different weather as their sailboats and kayaks were constantly in the water.
__label__0 It felt like starring in your very own intimate film.
__label__0 On our second Christmas trip we decided to try bidding on a hotel with priceline.com.
__label__0 To us the hotel is most likely a 2 stars with a 4 stars bathroom facility.
__label__0 We were pleasantly surprised when we were upgraded from the Beach Resort to the Palace.
__label__0 Only neg was no one served drinks at the pool.
__label__0 The room was FANTASTIC.
__label__0 I would recommend this hotel to anyone.
__label__0 Staff disorganized and surly.
__label__0 The desk people were very friendly and helped us in any way.
__label__0 yet each morning they asked for our signature as on their records it appeard as if our breakfast was exclusive.
__label__0 To be fair, Seattle parking in general is way overpriced -- comparable to NYC (where at least it seems merited).
__label__0 We were given a smoking room on the 2nd floor.
__label__0 They had one computer located at the check-in desk
__label__0 paradise found Secrets
__label__0 Package was to include free parking
__label__0 For your own good please stay away
__label__1 Boston itself is a really easy city to walk around and I would highy recommend it for a short break.
__label__0 each time after taking a shower the bathroom floor was soaked.
__label__1 If you want to soak in the hot-tub or swim in the pool at the end of a long day look for other accommodations.
__label__0 but that is only because I was attending a conference and appreciated the proximity to the convention center.
__label__0 Taxi fares are not cheap
__label__0 I would recommend without any hesitation.
__label__0 When the baby woke me screaming at 4am I wanted to go pick her up myself it took so long before mom and dad got up to respond to her cries
__label__0 Others may love it.
__label__0 very clean, incredible beach, ample bars and watering holes all around the campus, excellent athletic facilities, and again cannot overemphasize the friendly staff.
__label__0 I needed to receive and send a fax ... no problem ,and no charge,.
__label__0 Everything else was a crap shoot.
__label__0 The room we stayed in had some issues with the flooring, but the size and beds were not an issue.
__label__0 Room: Large, well furnished and stylish, but the sink, toilet and bath all overflowed.
__label__0 Not really the hotels fault, just the location.
__label__0 Furniture was old and shows the wear and tear.
__label__0 I booked the reservation thru their website and got a rate of $425 for a Superior Room.
__label__0 The swimming pool is rather small, just enough to refresh yourself.
__label__0 The sitting room off to the side of the room was the best part; plasma screen on the wall, armoire for hanging up clothes, a mini bar and a loveseat.
__label__0 The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful.
__label__0 I was staying here with my Starwood Points,
__label__0 Nice Base for Exploring
__label__0 They move us a third time, this room was small but it appeared to have working heat and air.
__label__0 The lobby is very small and looks newly refitted.
__label__0 It is older but well kept,
__label__0 The staff are helpful and nice
__label__0 and I was very happy with our choice to stay at the Sheraton.
__label__0 We stayed for 2 weeks the first time and 10 days the second time.
__label__0 Very arrogant, not helpful at all.
__label__0 Bathrooms were good.
__label__0 and showed photogaphs of the Berlin Mark on Meineke Strasse we found this not to be the case AFTER we had arrived at the hotel
__label__0 I was given a room in the river tower with a view of the other tower and pool.
__label__0 The noise from the construction was annoying at 6am
__label__0 A co-worker recommended this hotel knowing I wouldn't mind the lack of amenities (bring your own soap etc.), or the poor shape it's in.
__label__0 and felt like they were poorly washed.
__label__0 and on our return to the Hilton I have to say that the staff could not do enough for us.
__label__0 We had a king size bed
__label__1 For the best breakfast tun left as you leave the hotel and walk up to where the small bridge crosses the road at Grand Central Station under this bridge straight across from the station you get the most fantastic breakfast, be early it gets very busy.
__label__0 the staff were uber-helpful.
__label__0 The rooftop bar ,small, but nice outlet after a long day.
__label__0 but the traffic and street noise is very loud.
__label__0 Havent been to NY in 25 years and I forgot how amazing this city is.
__label__1 Yay After 2 hours of dealing with the floor manager, Matthew Sims,If you ever have to deal with this man, go above him.
__label__0 Ive dont have any photos but I would say that the hotel web site photos do not do this Hotel justice.
__label__0 The grounds are beautiful, room was nice, and overall we had a good time.
__label__1 I recommend not staying in room X01-X12 where X is the floor number.
__label__0 the beach was magnificent.
__label__0 We did not go on vacation to party and get drunk all the time.
__label__0 but the blatant avarice of the Sheraton on such matters when they were clearly not hurting for revenue was just appalling.
__label__1 Parking at $30 per day is an outrage but possibly standard for downtown (you can find street parking on the weekend to save a few dollars).
__label__0 The in-room dining is excellent.
__label__0 Pool closed, lobby torn apart and the owners
__label__0 Our weekend got off to a bad start when one girl had her purse pinched on the metro ,be very careful, but the reception staff were very helpful and told us exactly what we needed to do and where the police station was.
__label__0 You get this money back at the end of your trip as long as you return the key.
__label__0 Not many loud drinking parties.
__label__0 Check in couldnt have been any smoother.
__label__0 The Japaneese wasnt as fun as I was hoping for.
__label__0 The bathrooms were larger than expected and the walk-in shower was wonderful.
__label__0 There is a small bar and the staff are very friendly and helpful.
__label__0 But I dont think I would stay here again, I may need to pay more and get more.
__label__0 Walking in the hotel was dirty and dated.
__label__0 and it was stiflingly hot all the time.
__label__0 The pool was mid-seized but adequate and clean.
__label__0 only slight criticism was the room where you have breakfast,
__label__0 Room was clean, well furnished and serviced promptly.
__label__0 The very friendly front desk staff made excellent dinner recommendations and on one occassion even accompanied me to the nearby restaurant
__label__0 The room itself was dark with 2 very small double beds, but a view of the spaceneedle.
__label__0 I am travelling back to London next year and wont stay anywhere else.
__label__0 The manager and a assistant greeted us on the sidewalk.
__label__0 Enjoyed the size of the room and bathroom.
__label__0 Im only 54 and my feet hung over the edge of the bed.
__label__0 and the toilet door is opaque.
__label__0 It was just over 5 minutes walk to Dam Square and a couple of minutes away from Rembrantplein where there were lots of bars, clubs and restaurants.
__label__0 I asked to see the manager
__label__0 We will return very soon.
__label__0 Once we got to the island it was paradise.
__label__0 and it was nice too.
__label__0 After check out on our last day, they held our luggage at the hotel while we did some more sightseeing.
__label__1 If I had to recommend only one hotel in would be the Affinia Gardens.
__label__0 although a call to housekeeping solved this problem.
__label__0 You will go out with a guide and experience the countryside at close quarters.
__label__1 I would not recommend this if you want a good nights sleep.
__label__0 Lovely staff, great for business
__label__0 First, the location.
__label__0 The frame of the shower was also falling to pieces and came off in your hand when you closed the door.
__label__0 Stayed 2 days parking was 56 bucks.
__label__0 However, for the prices that this establishment charges, there are far better values like the Argonaut or right across the street, the Holiday Inn Express.
__label__0 No frills,no shampoo etc one bar of soap for all your needs.
__label__0 The second check-in was particularly nice, as one of the young ladies behind the desk made a special point to welcome my son back to the hotel with a high five and Its great to see you again.
__label__0 The Reception staff were aloof  sometimes quite rude.
__label__0 Had to talk to the manager to sort that out.
__label__0 Also, they offer burgers and hot dogs for lunch for those who need their fix of junk food.
__label__0 Yet, the rooms had a balcony, plus the bed was a tempur one.
__label__0 Those were similarly priced, friendlier, and a better quality room for the money.
__label__0 The rooms are simple but comfortable.
__label__0 They were also more than happy to store our luggage before and after check out, which was brilliantEverything is right there on the doorstep.
__label__0 The room was modernly decorated and within easy walking distance of Grand Central Station and the subway.
__label__0 We were relieved to discvover that the buffet at the Palace was much better - excellent really.
__label__0 Off to Pike Place market-a short jaunt from the hotel-fantastic location-a few dubious characters around,but you find that in any major city.
__label__0 Getting there by taxi can be a small problem first time but the hotel gives you a map so after the first time, there are no problems.
__label__0 We got the strong impression that 'tourists' were very much secondary to 'business' guests.
__label__0 choices were good and plenty of food available.
__label__0 I will stay at this hotel everytime I come to New York.
__label__0 By the way - the glass elevators are a nice touch
__label__0 The famous one on Nob Hill doesnt even offer that
__label__0 We stayed at The Orchard Hotel when we first arrived, it was twice the price and is further away from Union Square.
__label__0 But because of the constant spilling of water from handwashing etc, the wood was now cracking up and appearing very worn.
__label__0 we would have no problem choosing the Warwick again.
__label__0 And the location is definitely out of the way (although there is an U-bahn station just a half block away).
__label__0 and other traffic noise that it sounded like a freight train was going to come through the wall at any time.
__label__0 The front desk is disorganized,
__label__0 There is a Subway Starbucks store over the road which is very handy.
__label__0 The front desk tried to charge me an extra day that I had cancelled upon check-in - this was a 30 minute hassle.
__label__0 so we were more than happy, the hotel staff even moved all of our luggage.
__label__0 (and I'm not even a squeamish person)!
__label__0 Only one thing the shower doesnt have a lot of hot water - the water was just warm enough to have a shower but not comfortably warm.
__label__0 the vineyard restaurant is fantastic.
__label__0 Only once did we come back and see that housekeeping had kept a bag of trash on the bathroom sink and had forgotten to remove it, however someone came up in seconds after I called the front desk and had it cleared and kept on aplogizing.
__label__1 If I was to give one tip then take a taxi from the airport - we got the train and then the metro but had to make few changes along the way.
__label__0 Because we were traveling with a small child we needed to use the elevator which barely held myself and a child, but you still had to go up stairs to get to the elevator to Gravina II.
__label__0 A complimentary breakfast is available but we just hit the Starbucks and then the road each morning.
__label__0 Beds firm, pillows very soft.
__label__0 Esperanza main strip is only 5 min walk from hotel.
__label__0 I ordered risotto with mushroom with slivers of parmesan.
__label__0 I complained but was told nothing doing,
__label__0 We were never able to get the room much below about 76 degrees.
__label__1 If you prefer an outside room ask for one on an upper floor facing towards Berlin Catherdral only some 100 yards away.
__label__0 This hotel was expected to be top notch...but WAS NOT....as a diamond member status we had to wait 2 hours in the lobby until the room was ready...was upgraded to an ocean view room....but the rooms ARE THE SIZE OF A BIG CLOSET 
__label__0 And most important of all, the service people - front desk, bellmen, restaurant staff, housekeeping - were beyond helpful, cooperative, cheerful and friendly.
__label__0 Due to a very late flight, the desk was unable to change our room on check-in, but told us to come back the next day.
__label__0 Great location, a short walk to shopping  many popular points of interest (e.g. Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag, museums, checkpoint charlie).
__label__0 I pointed this out to both the reception and the cleaning staff.
__label__0 The bathroom was very clean and had a separate shower and tub.
__label__0 Bon Voyage
__label__0 rooms were clean  the housekeeping staff were lovely.
__label__0 Sometime in the future the old bullfighting arena at Plaza Espanya will be turned into a mall, but for now the only thing you can walk to from the hotel is the hill of Montjuic, which has the art museum, the fountain that is lit up at night, various botanical gardens, various smaller museums, the Spanish Village, and the cable car up to the castle.
__label__0 I researched this trip weeks in advance.
__label__0 I cut myself and asked for a bandaid
__label__0 We stayed in the Union Street tower (new standard king room) and found it to be very nice!!
__label__0 Staff were friendly and helpful - free safe in lock up behind the reception desk which is very useful as you need to make sure that you do not take anything of much value with you as there are many pick-pockets around.
__label__0 I don't go to Seattle to sit in my hotel room,
__label__0 This burst of cold water from the roof of the shower is quite the wake-up.
__label__0 The hotel is the quintessential bargain for college parents and is in the greatest location - not quite in the french quarter and not too far uptown.
__label__0 I stayed at the Hotel Monaco Seattle during a conference for work.
__label__0 We were upgraded from a queen to king room with a view
__label__0 I didn have any problems at all.
__label__0 The bed was comfortable.
__label__1 If you dont mind a 20 minute train ride to get into the city, this is the place to stay in Amsterdam.
__label__0 and a bit disgusted.
__label__0 Myself and spouse stayed at the Warwick Seattle for four days in September.
__label__0 Great customer service
__label__0 This was a terrific hotel in all respects--great location, fabulous service, and well appointed rooms ,we got upgraded to a suite which was lovely, very quiet and spacious,.
__label__0 that's just how it is!
__label__0 They have bridges going across the pool at different spots, just beautiful.
__label__0 The first I saw this was at the Marriott Marquis in NYC.
__label__0 Our room on the 15th floor had a city/water view.
__label__0 For one thing, the wash basin was a porcellain bowl placed on a wooden top.
__label__0 It was not much better but at least the toilet didnt leak and the sheets looked clean.
__label__0 Then hot tea arrived the room with Asian cookies.
__label__0 Quality was not very special and no flavour.
__label__0 Frankly, most of the associates didnt acknowledge anyones presence.
__label__0 We ate at both restaurants.
__label__0 I would definitely stay there again.
__label__0 beds looked horrible and the pillows were on the floor???
__label__0 the owners are very nice people and will call cabs for you, make suggestions, and fill other reasonable requests.
__label__0 Our corner room doubled as a fire escape, which allowed opening the window for fresh air.
__label__0 We were paying nearly three hundred dollars a night and had booked the room for four straight nights.
__label__0 The atmosphere in the room got hot, damp and unpleasant and having to get someone to open en close your window for you is every time you want to do something about it is irritating.
__label__0 Just returned from a fortnight in Berlin staying at the Steigenberger.
__label__0 Loved the Majestic
__label__0 I became aware at check out that they had charged my credit card.
__label__0 Gorgeous beach, beautiful resort *Readers be aware:
__label__0 then that there was only a military rate for the actual active military man and not the spouse.
__label__1 If you are traveling with younger kids you might want your rooms closer to the Dominica for the pool and beach activities.
__label__0 The staff was kind and helpful, always smily.
__label__0 the guest servicesdepartment delivered champaigne and put rose pedals on our bed at night.
__label__0 The rooms were above average for NYC and the were very clean.
__label__0 I stayed at the Grand Westin several times.
__label__0 The lobby was decorated beautifully and the staff were very friendly.
__label__0 The location is great for Belltown, the Federal Courthouse and the town's retail core.
__label__0 The spread included bagels, muffins, croissants, danishes, hardboiled eggs, fruit, cereal, milk, assorted juices and fresh coffee.
__label__0 Also the food at Friedrichs is boring and very traditional.
__label__0 But building #2 is so much closer to the pool they eventually switched us.
__label__0 This place obviously has a pattern of pulling this type of scam on tourists and should be closed down
__label__0 so if you don't want to pay minibar charges,
__label__0 After an easy flight from JFK we had to wait for over 35 minutes for the hotel bus to pick us up and bring us to the hotel.
__label__0 Stayed here for a night with some friends for a wedding.
__label__0 and unfortunately Warwick Seattle Hotel was the only dissapointment through our trip.
__label__0 Good choice for Waikiki
__label__0 so we thought we'd increase our budget slightly and stay here for 2 nights on our way home.
__label__0 We were suprised by the 42 flat screen tv on the wall when we opened the door.
__label__0 A supermarket and some very nice restaurants a 2 min walk away with Zoo station a 10 min stroll.
__label__0 I will most definitely return here.
__label__0 Mainly Europeans with the balance being Canadians and Americans.
__label__0 The flight crew on our flights were wonderful.
__label__0 When I exited the room, she appeared to be entering the room to clean, but when I returned at 2:30pm the room was still in the same condition which made me angry because I had returned to the room to rest.
__label__0 First of all, the stunning design bowled us over - we didnt want to leave the room.
__label__0 Pretty Nice
__label__0 and they didn't know.
__label__0 Perfect locaion, wonderful staff
__label__0 The pool was the highlight
__label__0 There is a sushi restaurant at the hotel which we have never tried.
__label__0 GREAT LOCATION: Close to the theatre district, Boston Common, Newberry Street, and the Long Wharf area.
__label__0 I will definitely be back.
__label__0 Room service and the food was excellent and fast.
__label__0 For those of us visitors without cars, taxis were easy to get and there is a new complex called Mary Brickell Village which has some good restaurants and is a 10 minute walk away.
__label__1 This is a great hotel if you want to stay somewhere a little different.
__label__0 If youre picking between this and something a little cheaper, this is WELL worth what we spent...well go back
__label__0 We were disappointed when we checked in
__label__0 but I noticed how rude the staff was to some small children that were in the lobby our second day there.
__label__0 The shower was in the bath with the shower head hooked up.
__label__0 and it was a good deal.
__label__1 If you are going to Barcelona, this is the place to stay.
__label__0 Cabs to the hotels are a flat $11.00 ,which includes a $1.00 fuel surcharge,.
__label__0 Both beaches offer restroom facilities.
__label__0 I go to Seattle at least 4 or 5 times a year for pleasure.
__label__0 The only other issue we had is that you can hear everything in the room next door through the connecting locked door.
__label__0 The bedding is old, and pillows lumpy.
__label__0 Room fine - clean  fair size.
__label__0 Also, there is no on-site hotel parking.
__label__0 We liked the Italian and mexican speciality the best.
__label__0 Staying at the Chelsea Lodge makes u feel as if you are living there and not just a visitor to a typical sterile hotel room.
__label__0 OK hotel Stayed 2 nights.
__label__0 When you arrive at the resort the bell man takes your luggage and you proceed to check in.
__label__0 The rooms had an understated elegance to them and there was considerable attention to detail - including a starched linen cloth at the foot of the bed for the slippers - a nice touch indeed.
__label__0 It is in a very good location - tube stop right outside or walking distance to Checkpoint Charlie.
__label__0 That said, my wife and kids enjoyed virgin pina coladas very much.
__label__0 Often we were not able to obtain beach towels, some days the wait was an hour, on others days the staff had no idea when more towels were coming.
__label__0 The shower incidentally was vibrating fine :-,
__label__0 I kid you not.
__label__0 Has very nice robes in room, CD player and DVD player.
__label__0 Lovely hotel.
__label__0 Ideal Spot Great Experience
__label__0 Connectivity from the hotel to all important places is good as it is right in front of the main station.
__label__0 The woman at the front desk didnt even greet us with a hello to us when we came into the front office...something you would expect if everyone proclaims they are friendly.
__label__0 The only option was to have the window open all of the time which made sleeping impossible due to noise from the street below.
__label__0 And we had to pay, because we didnt have the time to prove we were right.
__label__0 When she noticed I was there she ran out of the room.
__label__0 We ate mostly at the buffet that had great choices.
__label__0 other services are available : travel agency, security boxes in the reception, internet for 10 pesos per 15 minutes and the reception can keep your luggages if you are away for your last day...
__label__0 As far as location, this was a nice neighborhood and convenient to the subway, restaurants, shopping, etc. I was a female traveling alone,
__label__0 In the bathroom there is only liquid soap with two small towels.
__label__0 This is all good, and the location is excellent.
__label__0 The hotel was sold out and I could not move to another room.
__label__0 Out of all the associates I encountered, only two- a female security guard and the aforementioned bartender, were nice.
__label__0 and out of Tegel airport dont go through the security
__label__0 Will not repeat this hotel, and frankly hurt my impression of Sheraton overall as well.
__label__0 The food smelled spoiled most of the time.
__label__0 Wouldnt recommend horse back riding in Punta Cana, as horses are malnourished and are not what you would be used to.
__label__0 This place is away from the hustle and bustle of Honolulu.
__label__0 hotel was full and I got what I'd paid for, a single room.
__label__0 However on the minus side lighting in room at night was dim and bedside lights were a strain to read by, which we like to do.
__label__0 Breakfast buffet is superb.
__label__0 For our meal at The Grill restaurant, my husband was served tenderloin of beef that was rancid.
__label__0 It was nonsmoking.
__label__0 The rooms are spacious and the bed and duvet were very comfortable.
__label__0 We did not bring our laptop and the Copamarnia does not have any available computers, so we did not have a way to do any online research.
__label__0 I have to say I wish I'd stretched the budget.
__label__0 But for $875 taxes in, you cant complain too much.
__label__0 When we arrived at 3:30am they did not have a Jr.
__label__0 No place to get a quick cup of coffee at the Sheraton though.
__label__0 But otherwise it was a very interesting four days. Distances in Berlin are vast
__label__0 and I never heard noise (i.e. someone else's loud TV) except for the occasional bus route on the street below.
__label__0 Easy walk from Pike's market.
__label__0 The rooms were very well furnished but the bathroom in one of them was poor for a 4star hotel.
__label__0 The hotel is a small boutique hotel that has been recently modernised.
__label__0 and the attached picture is what we got.
__label__0 I stayed here last month and was terribly disappointed.
__label__0 It has a nice swimup bar where the bar tenders are amazing.
__label__0 Could go on for days about how pleased we were.
__label__0 My wife thought the breakfast was excellent
__label__0 Not a good experience
__label__0 This last visit the hotel was packed, so there was a huge wait to check in, even late at night, and with my SPG status.
__label__0 Negatives, sheets had small holes or even areas where it was torn.
__label__0 Let me explain. 
__label__0 There are some great things about the hotel.
__label__0 They rate this resort as a 5 star, and it truly is.
__label__0 we had to sleep in seperate beds!!!!
__label__0 Even thought I secured what I felt was a very reasonable rate on Hotwire I do not feel the hotel was worth the price.
__label__0 It is very close to Union Square, cable car turnaround, SF shopping center.
__label__0 but it was excellent.
__label__0 the hotel, and its staff were brilliant and could not do enough for you.
__label__0 He had offered me and upgrade from a city vista room to an ocean view during our correspondence and WHAT A VIEW
__label__0 Initial impressions of the place are understandibly quite bad.
__label__0 Shared toilets are not a problem at all.
__label__0 I am lucky enough to travel to Tokyo quite a lot and I always stay at the Okura ,South Wing,.
__label__0 We have now stayed at the Nob Hill Motor Inn three times and have been there several nights each time we were in San Franscisco.
__label__0 They loved sitting out on the beach in their own private area.
__label__0 So why has staying at the Sofitel caused us to go into print?
__label__0 On weeknights we had the facilitiies practically all to ourselves.
__label__0 It was an adventure cycling from the airport to downtown- midday is the ony time to attemtp this.
__label__0 I travelled with my 3 daughters--16, 12 12.
__label__0 It was a little pricier but so worth it if you are into views.
__label__0 and expensive breakfast buffet for $25. The pool area was poorly ventilated
__label__0 For 88 euros a night (double room), this hotel is an excellent value.
__label__0 As I was on my first floor balcony smoking a ciggarette to calm my nerves from dealing with this, somone from a top floor decided to spit and hit me in the back on my head and my hand.
__label__0 The rack rate is 400E which may be expensive if only two are staying.
__label__0 We arrived in Berlin from Tegel airport which does not have its own train station,
__label__0 The owners and receptionists spoke English and were very, very nice and accommodating - helped us with directions and book reservations at museums, etc.
__label__0 We had a standard room on the lower floors overlooking the central courtyard.
__label__0 Yellow tail snapper, some a foot long, and barracuda, sargeant fish, and tripletail were within 200 feet of the beach.
__label__0 The bedroom walls are also paper thin and so you are disturbed by other room sounds.
__label__0 We saw a couple of shows ,International and Michael Jackson, and liked them.
__label__0 The Marseilles is 2 blocks from Lincoln Road, 1 block from the Delano and 2 hotels down from The Raleigh.
__label__0 So, we tried to avoid using it during the night in order to sleep and if possible only
__label__0 This was the third time I have stayed at this property, but this will be my last time.
__label__0 Breakfast was fantastic.
__label__0 Food, choose from French,Texas style, Mexican, Dominican, Italian, Seafood, or Oriental.
__label__1 Tips: When you take the tram going back to the hotel, make sure it does NOT say Happy Valley or Causeway Bay.
__label__0 stuff at reception desk doesn't seem to be happy to work there so you also don't get any feeling you came to a good place Regarding the price we were paying (from 200 to 260USD per night) we expected a bit more.
__label__0 They charged the wrong girl, this time.
__label__0 I travelled with 3 others who had a number of bags - and a Cadillac Escalade was ready at my time of booking to take our group to the airport.
__label__0 I was advised to take a taxi to the hotel rather than the bus as, since Katrina, the buses in the area of the train station/arena/Superdome are irregular.
__label__0 Hotel is in Fishermans Wharf, close to everything.
__label__0 the staff goes out of their way to make sure you are happy and comfortable.
__label__0 and their own system had logged it in --
__label__0 The rooms are clean and modern we were on the top floor in a room overlooking the pool so we had a good view of the hills and had no noise problems.
__label__0 Noise: Constant ,until 4AM, front desk unapologietic, room on 3rd floor as if on the dancefloor,.
__label__0 Positives about the hotel are: the staff (very courteous at all levels), the food (breakfast was excellent and so was dinner in the restaurant) and location.
__label__0 Friendly attendant in the swimming pool/gym, although lots of kids in the pool.
__label__0 They have a great happy hour with half price appetizers from 4-6 and again from 9-11.
__label__0 The hotel is very clean, beautiful and offers friendly service.
__label__0 Its not a huge room, but we werent in our room very often anyways.
__label__0 We will definetely go back.
__label__0 There was also some inconsistency on the service...
__label__0 This place is a dump.
__label__0 There was a king size fourposter bed,draped in white muslin.
__label__0 The staff was also very flexible about splitting our bill several ways ,I was sharing a double room with two other people,.
__label__0 Concierge is not available 24 hours.
__label__0 Housekeeping was curteous and kept my room clean and stocked.
__label__1 And please ignore the negative comments.
__label__0 It is a cute place, they have done some fun things with the decor.
__label__0 We choose to to eat out for three quarters of the time on the basis of cost and also to experience New Yorkers food
__label__0 Im used to a firm bed, so my back was sore most of the weekend.
__label__0 and they said sorry, but since we arrived late they were unable to accommodate us
__label__0 Not willing to accept this for __�_145/night I changed room to across the hall but was reminded by the staff that the room standard for the category booked.
__label__0 and even the manager told me (I still can't believe I heard this) that they had given us a smoking room,
__label__0 First of all, the location of the Andra can't be beat.
__label__0 It is also located in the Reforma district and in front of the Turibus stop where you can hop on and take a 4 hour tour of the city for nearly 100 pesos per day or 150 pesos for a 2 day weekend pass, which is well worth it.
__label__0 3. The main conceirge did not give me a warm and fuzzy feeling.
__label__0 Location is not bustling - but it is close to everything.
__label__0 However it is in close proximity to the major shopping street (Ku_��_damm) and other tourist attractions (e.g. the Zoo, Aquarium, Kaiser Wilhelm Church, the Ka-De-We Dept Store).
__label__0 The first room ,3rd floor, also smelled funny, as did the 3rd floor hallway and the lobby.
__label__0 great little hotel
__label__0 And the beds are amazingly comfortable: fine cotton sheets and soft down duvets and pillow made for a relaxing sleep.
__label__0 but the Moore had nothing.
__label__0 But no problem; there were plenty of opportunities for a very good and inexpensive breakfast within a couple of minutes on foot from the hotel entrance.
__label__0 Going back to Bryant Park would feel like going home to a place of warm memories.
__label__0 We chose the express bus.
__label__0 Great Rooms, OK service.
__label__0 The food was generally of good quality-but not necessarily geared to American tastes.
__label__0 I am a very frequent traveller,
__label__0 The staff were very very helpful, the rooms were wonderful Will we return??
__label__0 The hotel is close to WTC but to close to La Rambla for my tast.
__label__0 The rooms are very clean and functional
__label__0 We stayed room only as eating out in New York is great.
__label__1 Would definitely recommend the hotel: we stayed a couple of nights at the W Seattle
__label__0 the concierge that we went to see about finding a laundry mat was a bit of pain in the rear,
__label__0 Calm in the eye of the storm
__label__0 Restaurants are buffet style and a la carte.
__label__0 We were located directly accross from the elevator and ice!
__label__0 The hotel itself is fine;
__label__1 One small note -- there is a great Vietnamese restaurant around the corner called Bambuza -- don't miss it!
__label__0 If I had one complaint to make about our stay it would be the problem w/ our shower.
__label__0 Guests must climb with luggage.
__label__0 We stayed at The Regent in August for two days to celebrate my birthday.
__label__0 but I consider our treatment unacceptable.
__label__0 and no lift it is also below standard.
__label__0 Breakfast was typical hotel fare, not especially exciting, but fresh, varied and plentiful.
__label__0 I do usually stay in 4 star hotel and have stayed in better 4 stars than the  5 star Steigenberger Berlin.
__label__0 From the chromed elevator to the mysterious Murphy bed, the tear drop trash cans and the dimmable light tower, she was intrigued.
__label__0 They gave me a single bed when i asked for seperate queen beds.
__label__0 $4 bucks for a candy bar
__label__0 The bathroom whilst adequate was a rather basic white tiled room which didn't quite match the granduer of the bedroom and public areas.
__label__0 It is very well placed for central Paris - 10 minutes walk to Eiffel Tower, Pont dAlma.
__label__0 Feel free to contact me via E-mailZacharias J ReisPba_fla@yahoo.com
__label__0 Nice resort if you just like the ocean but definitely NOT A GOLF RESORT.
__label__0 We stayed at the Moore for two nights right after Memorial Day, in a standard room with 2 double beds and a private bath on the 7th floor (719).
__label__0 After leaving for the evening and returning to our room, we discovered why the pine sol scent was so strong----it was masking the smell of urine in our room!!!
__label__0 No curtains, and water pours off you onto the tile floor which has a drain.
__label__0 I also tried the Spanish, Italian, Japanese and Brasilian restaurants.
__label__0 We ate at Cafe Dumonde ,dont think im spelling it correctly, but ask anyone and theyll know what your talking about,, mostly for its historic aspects.
__label__0 At the risk of sounding like a line from "Cabaret," everything about this hotel is beautiful.
__label__0 We called to the front desk and got promised they will change it, nothing was happen during our stay.
__label__0 lock seemed out of alignment.
__label__0 We got a great rate that was advertised on Travelzoo.com
__label__0 The rooms were unusually large for a city hotel, and very comfortable, with a pleasant and muted W-ish decor.
__label__0 We would definetely stay at this hotel again.
__label__0 Great location We stayed at the Le
__label__0 We just returned from Secrets Excellence in Punta Cana.
__label__0 hard rock cafe a few doors away and the breakfast is fab, busy but worth the wait,
__label__0 They charge you for everything.
__label__0 We stayed atthe Melia Bali for the first five nights of our honeymoon this summer.
__label__0 The Pool, Spa, And exercise facility's are all closed and will not reopen until October,
__label__0 I then asked the housekeeper if she could give me 5 minutes, because I was on my way out and she said yes.
__label__0 Perhaps some rooms have decent views
__label__1 Beware: some rooms are very small and outdated
__label__0 Location: First off, Hollywood itself isnt a real nice place to stay - its sketchy in several areas and not necessarily what many out-of-towners might picture.
__label__0 The manager worked really hard and offered up the sincerest "sorry" he could muster.
__label__0 The beds were comfortable
__label__0 The location is best, near the train station ,5 minutes walk, and many budget eating houses nearby.
__label__0 and we had a nice time.
__label__0 The bed was fantastic.
__label__0 And we were really put off by the tourist buses and groups.
__label__0 Everything else was extremely positive after that, though.
__label__0 The major strength of the Sheraton Seattle is its location.
__label__0 The interior decor reflected modern style and charm with four-star comfort.
__label__0 We stayed in the front and the traffic and other street noise was very loud.
__label__0 Service and food at the Italian resturant was excellent ,Carolynn at breakfast was full of information and was a treasure,.
__label__0 2, One elevator of the two was broken during our stay.
__label__0 We were only disappointed we couldnt stay longer in this great city.
__label__0 Room 513,9/29/07
__label__0 The great price you will get to stay at this resort should make tipping easier for all.
__label__0 Our room was a good size, very nice and clean and having air conditioning was a major plus.
__label__0 Really not worth the money for such a top class hotel.
__label__0 and upon check-in the receptionist confirmed the room as non-smoking.
__label__0 Reviews are correct
__label__0 Just one thing - do not be put off by the rather dark street entrance.
__label__0 In addition, just a stonethrow away, The Palast der Republik was in the process of being torn down.
__label__0 When I asked the concierge to help get a reservation to a new restaurant in the city she wasnt aware of it.
__label__0 We are then brought to another room garden view with 2 small beds, not acceptable for $100.00 a day.
__label__0 and both are convenient to Berlin's extensive public transport.
__label__0 We actually turned off the heat and froze just so we wouldn't be subjected to the smell.
__label__0 you'll have an ok time if you're just expecting a basic place to sleep.
__label__0 If you want to purchase the hotel service package for $9, you receive an additional admission to the water park ,we had 4 with our room,, unlimited use of the fitness facility, miniature golf, 2-for 1 ice cream, etc.
__label__0 We shopped at Macys and went to Walgreens for our snacks.
__label__0 Clean,comfortable room.
__label__0 A Bit of a Disappointment
__label__0 Room was comfortable, quite spacious, well appointed and very clean.
__label__0 My wife and I decided to fly in early and spend a night in San Francisco.
__label__0 Stay Away....Far Away
__label__0 The hotel is OK for leisure travellers but not particularly useful for business travellers.
__label__0 ) one, very unpleasant!!
__label__0 The bedding situation consisted of two twin size beds that we tried to put together but, one was higher than the other, some way to consummate a marriage?
__label__0 It was such a wonderful surprise we went back down to thank them.
__label__0 Fantastic location in the middle of East-Berlin at the corner of two historic streets.
__label__0 The steak house and japaneese restaurants were great.
__label__0 The room was extremely basic and the bed
__label__0 The staff were very friendly and helpful apart form one (there's always one!)
__label__0 We both loved Berlin
__label__0 Luckily I managed to purchase earplugs later.
__label__0 Public transport was very accessible.
__label__0 We stayed here from the 10th January for 3 nights and the last leg of our Honeymoon.
__label__0 I then walked over to the front desk, and requested that some bottled water be brought up to my room from room service.
__label__0 The front desk service was great - they recommended great places to eat, order delivery, and get a shuttle to the airport.
__label__0 and the fact that I had checked-out
__label__0 I thought that was a nice touch.
__label__0 Nice seating options at the pool, nice lounging areas, relaxing.
__label__0 Reception wasn��_t the friendliest but did their jobs well.
__label__0 Get it in writing
__label__0 When you have a tour bus to catch you cant afford to wait around for your breakfast.
__label__0 I explained how bad everything was when I left, they replied you will have to talk to hotwire.
__label__0 and in this case I would stay here again.
__label__0 There was no one there to help me with my luggage and no ramp up from the street.
__label__0 and the Moore represents fair value.
__label__0 Breakfast was large and wonderful.
__label__0 We were offered the hotel car for dinner and never had to get a cab to go anywhere.
__label__0 I booked my room on priceline for $55.00 per night ,plus I had a free upgrade coupon to the club floor,.
__label__0 The location in a quiet residential neighborhood was great for us, as it gives a different view of SF than the usual downtown one, but it could be inconvenient for some travellers.
__label__1 Request a 6th or 7th floor room facing the water and you'll enjoy a view that most visitors pay through the nose for.
__label__0 Room service was quick and efficient.
__label__1 Room layout good - but would recommend some barrier to stop water from the shower getting the carpet wet
__label__0 Our room was small and poorly furnished and stocked (no microwave, fridge etc.).
__label__0 All amenities associated with a good business hotel at an above average level.
__label__0 Stayed at the paradisus for our honeymoon sept. 18-24.
__label__0 I did not have time to eat.
__label__0 Personally the fact that I had major trouble sleeping in the room is the largest factor to decide if a hotel is good or bad
__label__0 Not alot to choose from.
__label__0 Ive been all over the world, and have stayed in many 5 star resorts.
__label__0 SF - Excellent
__label__0 The bathroom was a let down,
__label__0 The restaurants serve on Island Time as well, but there is always the buffet, which was delicious.
__label__0 No comment on the rooms as we did not see them.
__label__0 The Hotel staff were attentive,
__label__0 attractive building, noisy and so on, we met an unexpected problem when we brought a group of 26 students.
__label__0 We gave US$35 for a ride ,including tip,.
__label__0 they put us in a room for 2 and got two other beds from some other room.
__label__0 and The Moore is situated right there in the middle of the bad part of town.
__label__0 Several times they assisted us with public transportation schedules and attraction information.
__label__0 but when we did eat in the Hotel we found the food and service excellent.
__label__0 hotel was fine with some exceptions
__label__1 If this is your preference, be advised that the balconies are barely wide enough to fit a human.
__label__0 I have travelled many, many times and this by far was the nicest budget-minded hotel I have ever stayed in.
__label__1 The location is amazing, very near the Duomo ,if you are a light sleeper this can be bad for the tolling bells,, just around the corner from the Piazza Republica and down the street from the Uffizi museum and square.
__label__0 Good location between Times Square and Central Park, Blue line station on 50th and 8th, walk to theaters, plus hot and cold breakfast with 2 staff members in the dining area.
__label__0 The hotel has a new updated tower (no high floors) and lost it's parking space-thus now only offers expensive valet parking at 35.00 +tax.
__label__0 I have stayed 7 nights
__label__0 The Hotel is in a great location.
__label__0 Theres no place for breakfast.
__label__0 The restaurant they recommended was good.
__label__0 As a previous poster noted, the spa facilities are in the basement, and it felt too isolated for my comfort.
__label__0 The 2 ladies on reception were very helpful and kind to us.
__label__0 We loved several things about the Ayre: ,1, it is QUIET.
__label__0 The rooms were clean and the bathroom was completely up to date.
__label__0 We did not feel safe actually standing on the balcony,
__label__0 I strongly recommend to find another hotel rather than staying at the Belfort.
__label__0 Excellent family-run hotel
__label__1 DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING AND YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!
__label__0 Greater: Lizandro Rodriguez, was very friendly and curteous the whole week I was there.
__label__0 Be warned - the sauna and steam room does not permit swim wear i.e. it's nude (and mixed) with a towel for modesty if you prefer.
__label__0 just extra unneccessary hassle.
__label__1 If you receive this, please note: It is NOT APPLICABLE to Sarentos , roof-top-expensive-incredible views, Restaurant.
__label__0 but it just doesn't have any wow factor.
__label__0 The bathroom had both bath and separate walk-in shower which we consider essential.
__label__0 It struck me that if 6 Motel ever decided they wanted to go resort style this would be the place that they would open up.
__label__0 and it was either boiling hot or freezing cold.
__label__0 My wife and I were given a view which overlooked a parking lot and other peoples balconies.
__label__0 Toiletries were below average but thats not a huge consideration for us.
__label__0 I would definitely love to return to the St Francis in the future.
__label__0 The resort spa is separate building and they charge a lot more.
__label__0 Since the arrangement was for the client to pay for expenses, the hotel staff made him come down to the hotel with his credit card and to add insult to injury, made him fill out a long document which delayed an appointment by 10 minutes.
__label__0 The other services we received from Air Transat for this vacation were exceptional; the staff at the Vancouver airport was helpful and polite.
__label__0 We had a beautiful kitchen, with a nice table and livingroom with a balcony, and also a flat panel TV, and huge bedroom with a King bed, and also another flat panel TV.
__label__0 They try there best to sell you anything.
__label__0 The front desk, one of the nights we were there, was run by one of the rudest people I have ever met.
__label__0 There were also plenty of chairs for everyone.
__label__0 We have stayed at the hotel several times.
__label__0 ,They decided to stay another night.,
__label__0 The lobby fireplace added a cheerful,
__label__0 They cheated us
__label__0 Finally, on my last day when I took breakfast I was treated to a very loud conversation about me by the waiters in the restaurant
__label__1 I would recommend the Warwick to someone looking for a reasonable priced hotel,
__label__0 The best thing about this hotel is its location.
__label__0 and departures gates until you are ready to fly as there is Nothing on the other side of security, just gates and seats.
__label__0 Great owners, service, location
__label__0 It was our first time to the island of Puerto Rico which was not as exciting as we had hoped but the hotel and the service were absolutely superb.
__label__0 However, what makes me angry is that when I try to contact the manager, Joanna Turmo, she will not take my calls, or return my calls.
__label__0 The staff were excellent- very friendly even during and after the earthquake.
__label__1 If you are not a diver, I would recommend you stay at the Copamarina because it is very nice and peaceful.
__label__0 The bartenders/waiters are so friendly that they ask you not only if you are enjoying yourselves but where you are from and so on.
__label__0 After much research and reading of reviews on this site, I chose this hotel.
__label__0 My wife hated the room.
__label__0 I soon discovered things were a bit different.
__label__0 but there is a rotten egg smell that takes over at times.
__label__0 Great place to stay
__label__0 Not an issue.
__label__0 The pool/gym area is open 24 hours/day.
__label__0 In restaurant the food quality is good.
__label__0 We were all fed free of charge, breakfast, lunch and dinner and everyone had smiles on their faces.
__label__0 Obviously, itll take more than two months to get to the four star level.
__label__0 Apart from all the above the location is great, central and quite.
__label__0 I had a pleasant 15 minute walk to the Moscone Center and my daughter was able to walk Union Square and environs and even up to China Town.
__label__0 We stayed at the Sheraton for two nights after our Alaskan cruise.
__label__0 We arrived in the evening and had dinner on the terrace at the hotel restaurant, looking out over the historical center and the twinkling city lights.
__label__0 The exception is the 7th floor restaurant at the Ka-De-We.
__label__0 It's an easy walk to all sightseeing attractions (five blocks from the waterfront) and there is a free bus in Seattle
__label__0 The hotels breakfast buffet is bountiful and delicious, and the prices reasonable.
__label__1 Ill recommend it to everyone heading to the City.
__label__0 In addition to the problem with food services at the Flamenco, we had one complete day with no running water in our room and the service at the beach left much to be desired.
__label__0 Half of Palace Hotel has been renovated recently and consists of contemporary landings and bedrooms/suites.
__label__0 Close to the Mongkok MTR so convenient.
__label__0 and all they said was they were sorry.
__label__0 Enjoyed the Stay
__label__0 Think you can do better.
__label__0 My husband and my nine year old son enjoyed the indoor pool just before going out to dinner.
__label__0 There was not enough seating for the number or guests and because the buffet was divided into two sections; it was necessary to go to both lines to obtain a complete meal.
__label__0 The hotel public areas and rooms are lovely; breakfast is good; and happy hour is just the thing after a day of exploring Florence
__label__0 I just got back from a week stay there.
__label__0 I would certainly never stay in this hotel again.
__label__0 The shower is a european shower which you will need to get the sand out of all the places.
__label__0 They serve the well-known beignets.
__label__0 The cafe had opened downstairs so we were able to grab something light and easy for breaky.
__label__0 The air conditioning was turned off, even though it was cold outside our room was as hot as a sauna.
__label__0 The bathroom was clean, and so modern that at first I could not figure out how to drain the sink ,I thought it was malfunctioning,, but a quick visit from maintenance showed I just wasnt hip enough to figure it out.
__label__0 We would definitely return to this hotel
__label__1 Definitely avoid travelling by Easyjet at weekend late evenings!
__label__0 The lounge area overlooking the Arno was a great place to relax at the end of the day and get a few glasses of wine before heading out for dinner.
__label__0 That place is a mess.
__label__0 Toiletries were below average but that's not a huge consideration for us.
__label__1 If you do stay there and even if you dont, make sure you have dinner at House of Nanking on Kearny - excellent
__label__0 You won't be disappointed.
__label__1 So if you make a reservation through internet, you have to call them and confirm it
__label__0 Its  a 5 minute walk or you can take a tram.
__label__0 Looking at about $32.00 extra tacked on the hotel bill for valet overnight parking.
__label__0 The ocean-front corner room was nice, quiet, spacious and a very good value.
__label__0 Hotel location was good,
__label__0 It is definately not a four star.
__label__0 Loved it all
__label__0 Canal Street is under repair, as is much of the city, even two years after Katrina.
__label__0 VERY beautiful and stylish lobby.
__label__0 We only had breakfast at Lola (the adjoining restaurant)
__label__0 On the other hand the staff was very friendly and honest.
__label__0 We stayed at the Hilton for two nights at the beginning of December.
__label__0 All in all a perfectly good nice hotel in a very good location which as I said before is everything in Berlin.
__label__0 The best resort experience we have ever had.What we really liked...1.
__label__0 I lived in Center City Philadelphia for 10 years and was still shocked by the number of homeless people in Seattle.
__label__0 I not only plan on contacting St Vincents, my credit card company, but state and local authorities.
__label__0 The room was a perfectly normal hotel room; ditto with bathroom -- in short,
__label__0 Got a deal on hotwire for two days:Great location, very good service, ok room.
__label__0 It was a huge struggle to get a nice room,
__label__0 I lived very nearby in Miami Springs for sixteen years, so while the neighborhood doesnt look like much I know it is just airport industrial, and safe.
__label__0 the hotel and the rooms were imaculate, ohh and what a room.
__label__0 and I enjoyed the location (near Brandenburg, Museum Island, etc), but I wasn't blown away.
__label__0 No heavenly pillows; no heavenly beds; and no heavenly comforters here.
__label__0 and I felt perfectly safe walking around there at night.
__label__0 Forget about the rooms in this hotel!
__label__0 The place also offers massages in little huts by the pool and beach.
__label__0 I am not sure I can gush enough about this fine hotel.
__label__0 They can be seen in the attached photos.
__label__0 I thought they were updating their standards.
__label__0 They will cheat you.
__label__0 There is a wine bar called Nabucca on Via XXVII April, which had a nice spread of appetizers, complimentary with drinks.
__label__0 Check -in was fine, as there was 14 of us it took a while but no longer than youd expect, plus we were all upgraded from standard to deluxe rooms.
__label__0 Cons: free internet only in the business center which has only 2 computers with a sign ,15 minutes per guest only,.
__label__0 Perfect rooms, wonderful views, attentive staff and San Francisco.
__label__0 Even with the window shut you could hear trafficnoise all through the night.
__label__0 They had on some days another breakfast room opened on another floor.
__label__0 There was a spacious closet and two comfortable bathrobes.
__label__0 Again, we seated ourselves after waiting--WITH A RESERVATION for the main restaurant every night we ate there.
__label__0 Also the tour bus goes from just outside one of the many HMs located on the K'damn.
__label__0 That evening, I discovered that I had forgotten my laptop power adapter in the Sheraton hotel room.
__label__0 Berlin Plaza has no air conditioning
__label__1 Absolutely don't stay at this hotel if you're driving.
__label__0 They could have done this at the begining instead of sending her on a hike of the backstreets of Berlin.
__label__0 Back down I went
__label__0 I saw hot dogs once or twice.
__label__0 This means that the hotel wasdeliberately limiting the number of available reservations at the more intimate and more labor intensive alla carte restaurants, and in doing so were steering people to the much more cost efficient buffets.
__label__0 The hotel has floor-to-ceiling single glazed windows and even on the 8th floor,
__label__0 I have also stayed at the Sheraton LAX and it was better.
__label__0 Problems: There isn't a moderate / good for family restaurant in the hotel and it is hard to find these in the hotel neighborhood as well, unless you just want fast food.
__label__0 Like I said, very odd.
__label__0 Neither the staff of the hotel or your representative in Punta Cana showed any interest in resolving any of the problems we encountered; we certainly hope that this is not indicative of your company policy.
__label__0 Space, cleanliness, large functional bathroom, and new bed made up for the somewhat odd decor of the room.
__label__0 and the toiletries provided were way too perfumey.
__label__0 Great hotel, great location
__label__0 Sure, there are hiccups from time to time, but just speak up -- they will apologize and go beyond in making things right.
__label__0 The only positive things to say about the hotel is that it is in a very good location,
__label__0 With a little persuading the manager on site agreed to have my laundry sent out for free, which I thought was very nice.
__label__0 I am pretty sure our luggage would not fit in there.
__label__0 As an instance, I went to ask him about reservation and he said we will talk tomorrow morning, thanks you without even looking at me.
__label__0 floor to ceiling glass balcony doors are soundproofed.
__label__1 I would strongly reccomend this hotel and would have no hesitation in staying there again.
__label__0 We had a nice view of the bay, although some buildings got in the way.
__label__0 As I booked through Carnival I assumed the hotel would be of a decent standard, Carnival should look at this part of the operation, the feel good experience should start when we get to Miami.
__label__0 The room was very clean - we could smell the cleaning supplies when we entered the room.
__label__0 The color pallette in the room was very soothing- soft earth tones, beige, brown, merlot.
__label__0 the beds are comfortable
__label__0 Booked Sheraton for one night through hotwire as I extended my stay in Seattle
__label__0 Request for change was denied, notwithstanding my Starwood card.
__label__0 Due to my SPG Platinum Status, this time I had a corner suite with a great view, but it was a old interior...
__label__0 It was quite posh,
__label__0 We rented bikes for $15/day from hotel but they were in pretty poor condition.
__label__0 I like a nice glass of wine in the evening and would like a bit of AC with it.
__label__0 Not only would I never stay in this hotel again,
__label__0 In the Bedroom this is were the hotel did not meet my expectations the bedroom we got was definitely not 5 stars, no tea or coffee making facilities in the room, no bath robes or slippers, and for the bathroom, well I've seen bigger bathrooms on airplanes I can stress this enough
__label__0 While Im certain the service for all guests is exceptional, the extra attentiveness by Anthony, the Club Concierge was most welcome, especially from our daughter.
__label__0 The hotel is under construction so the entrance is poorly marked on the side side of the hotel.
__label__0 it ruined our holiday in Berlin!!
__label__0 We were here for the Easter long weekend and loved it.
__label__0 Kind of small, bad furnished and without any air-conditioning.
__label__0 The hotel staff that peddled excursions harassed you in the hotel, on the grounds and on the beach constantly.
__label__0 He inquired how things were going.
__label__0 True, the location is very convenient to the central shopping district and the staff are mostly courteous.
__label__0 Theres a nice view from the pool/health club.
__label__0 The Concierge Desk, Victor, Patrick, Mohammed, Jonathan, to name just a few, were always pleasant, efficient and helpful.
__label__0 but we found the hotel very quiet for its size
__label__0 Booked at this hotle over a month in advance.
__label__0 Our morning paper never arrived.
__label__0 There is a third buffet restaurant but it is in the Vera Club section ,Italian folks, and Im not even sure if we were allowed there, although we did not try.
__label__0 Seattle is a very hilly city which adds to the vehicular noise.
__label__0 No better place to stay in Venice.
__label__0 Breakfast: Nice, sunny room with plenty of well-stocked items.
__label__0 but there were a few problems worth mentioning.
__label__0 The last time they gave us a room that had been made up to look clean, but actually had dirty sheets and a bathroom that had been used.
__label__0 The parking attendants were working hard but still have to wait outside in the cold for your car.
__label__0 Minimal tea  coffee (one cup per day) and mini bar.
__label__0 The location of the hotel is good - fairly close to everything.
__label__0 Well, havent stayed in Four Seasons or Peninsula so hard to compare those clearly spectacular venues.
__label__0 The shows are pretty good.
__label__0 Despite the fact that this could be a very cool hotel, the place sucks.
__label__0 Rooms nices, Staff helpful.
__label__0 75 for the 3 nights which is exceptionally cheap
__label__0 and the lobby is very pritty and impressive.
__label__0 after booking thru expedia, i read some reviews and was concerned about the Warwick.
__label__0 The view from the room wasn't great.
__label__0 our viewpoint is a bit different than other customers.
__label__0 This occured 4 times.
__label__0 so were upgraded to executive room on the executive floor.
__label__1 And, if you are not wealthy, you should visit the cafe anyway.
__label__0 Our room ,king bed, was spacious and nicely appointed, very comfortable and with plenty of pillows.
__label__0 They just had this attitude that was not appreciated!
__label__0 We always managed to find something and even if it was in the sun, we would take a beak in the shade by sitting on the comfy cushioned chairs sofas that rim the buffet restaurant.
__label__0 I definitely was not disappointed.
__label__0 Clean, quiet and comfortable rooms.
__label__0 but didn't have a good experience at Cafe Campagne...
__label__0 This is a complicated place to rate.
__label__0 The bed was not very comfortable.
__label__0 and really did not inspire confidence.
__label__0 Since the mayority of vacationers are from Spain, Portugal, Canadian and Argentinian to name a few, most of the food is guided toards them.
__label__0 If I had to travel to San Francisco again, I would only stay at the Hotel Union Square if it were again the only place I could find.
__label__0 Also upon check-out, they got the costs of my stay wrong, trying to charge me __�_200 more then Radisson reservations had booked the room at.
__label__0 Our rate included breakfast ,2 people,.
__label__0 They agreed to give me a room (hmmm...thought they were sold out) but said they couldn't accomodate all the nights of my stay.
__label__0 You can let in outdoor noise or block it out with their windows.
__label__0 Just around the corner from the hotel is a FABULOUS little Italian restaurant - Bon Amici.
__label__0 But the atmosphere is soul-less.
__label__0 Rooms were clean and comfortable and breakfast was good with plenty of choice.
__label__0 Staff were at all times exceptionally courteous and polite.
__label__0 Breakfast was great and catered for all the health freaks to full on english breakfast and cakes.
__label__0 They put us on the wait list, which looked really long.
__label__0 The maid insisted on cleaning our room
__label__0 and more options are available for shoppers, diners, beer and cocktail seekers than ever before.
__label__0 We have been to mexico 5 times and jamaica and we had the best time by ourselves.
__label__0 but really could not tell the difference between a standard room and a club level room(if you asked).
__label__0 Then when it was over and the police came the hotel manager on duty refused to remove the assailants from the property as he said they were victims too when it was apparent these heavily intoxicated people perpetrated the act.
__label__0 Makes me wish I could afford to splurge on hotels like this on my own every once in a while
__label__0 a crowd had come in
__label__0 Yes, this is a beautiful hotel, but aside from that there is nothing.
__label__1 If you do want to do any shopping like I said before to the left of the resort there is about 10 little shops.
__label__1 you really want a room at the back of the hotel rather than at the front.
__label__0 The bed was very comfortable and everything was kept really clean.
__label__0 Great hotel Hotel was conveniently located steps from a subway station and key bus routes.
__label__0 The rooms are big and are fairly priced for a Boston hotel.
__label__1 They'll hold your luggage for you either before your check-in time or after you've checked out but have a few hours to kill before catching your flight.
__label__0 Only compaints are that the service is a little slow during busy times and during one of my stays there were three or four tiny ants on the floor.
__label__0 This meant no electricity in certain portions of the complex everyday.
__label__0 When I arrive the valet man start yelling at us.
__label__0 The rooms were well appointed and roomy enough bathrooms were fine.
__label__0 We just returned from Vieques.
__label__0 PoolsThree on site, but one was closed for repairs at the far end of the resort.
__label__0 We saved money staying in one of their shared bath suites.
__label__0 The restaurant on property was ok - but did not bill to your room.
__label__0 There is something for everyone there.
__label__0 We took many of the reviewers advice and signed up for the Wyndham By Request.
__label__0 The petty crime and pickpocketing in Spain is completely out of control: there were three attempts that we know of on us in two weeks, all in or around the metros.
__label__0 We asked again to be moved to one of their luxurious suites ,as advertised on their website, and were told they had no such thing as a suite in that hotel.
__label__0 They know I love the fabulous chocolate chip cookies they make--and the night before I left--they had a tray of them sent to my room with a fond farewell written out in chocolate.
__label__0 We also partook of the FREE washer and dryer on every floor.
__label__0 We were not given another room and had to wait until the next day for the tap and fridge to be fixed.
__label__0 Dinner on the first night in the restaurant H-eat was less than expected.
__label__0 All that I expected and much, much more
__label__1 Its a good 20 minute drive to the center of Scottsdale ,if youre looking to dine at one of the many fine dining spots in the Scottsdale area.
__label__0 Room very comfortable with climate control.
__label__0 Not all the Sofitel international standard, where was the MyBed (Sofitel's incredibly comfortable bed)?
__label__0 Location is excellent.
__label__0 It was fantastic, and I think weve finally found a Sydney hotel for our regular stays.
__label__0 Not so bad....
__label__0 The pool was fine, clean and towels were available in the pool area.
__label__0 Very trendy, but warm and inviting at the same time.
__label__0 The hotel is located in the former East Berlin and is well placed for most of the sights.
__label__1 Bottom line, if internet access is a factor, stay elsewhere.
__label__0 You will not be dissapointed.
__label__0 Spent three nights at the Royal Ramblas in May.
__label__0 The pool area is fantastic
__label__0 Great time had by all
__label__1 The University Inn is a very good deal that I would recommend to our friends.
__label__0 My room was on the 4th floor, that had dark and claustrophobic hallways.
__label__1 Ps Do the circle line boat tour to see the statue of liberty and the new york skyline it is fantastic.
__label__1 Parking at the park house Picpus recommended , 10min walk away from hotel.
__label__0 Modern Comfort at the Clarendon Hotel
__label__0 If you could not find anything here to eat, stay home.
__label__0 You bet we will soon as possible
__label__0 The room was clean and well maintained.
__label__0 The room was fantastic and clean and well designed .
__label__0 We arrived at lunchtime - ordered food and proceeded to wait a LONG time.
__label__0 The bathtub had moldy/dirty caulking,the mattress cover was not fitted and rolled up all night to the point of being very uncomfortable.
__label__0 Best part - YOU ARE ONLY TWO BLOCKS FROM THE WATERFRONT.
__label__1 Even with these benefits I would not recommend staying in this hotel.
__label__0 Very disappointed.
__label__0 We called the front desk,
__label__0 On Sat. nights during the summer, they show Dive-in movies at 7:30 p.m - you can watch the movie while in the pool or sit on the deck chairs, complete with popcorn.
__label__0 Fish shouldnt smell fishy or like garbage.
__label__0 The concierge was very helpful in helping us select a restaurant that was perfect for our tastes and making dinner reservations.
__label__0 The turkey club was good, albeit served just on run-of-the-mill white bread, not the advertised sourdough.
__label__0 The ferry ran every 1/2 hr and only took about 8 minutes to get there, but we just missed the ferry and had to sit and wait for the next one so from the time we left our room it was about 45 minutes until we got to the beach.
__label__0 Keep up the good work.
__label__0 The Intercontinental in Berlin was highly disappointing to my fiance
__label__0 Whilst this is our first Tripadvisor report - our opinion of the Sofitel is based on comparison with a variety of Hotels across four continents.
__label__0 executive floor representitives are cold too.
__label__0 Cool I guess, but the problem is even on volume as low as it will go it comes on supper supper loud with this Errerrrt sound, and you quickly turn it back off.
__label__0 The bed itself was very comfortable and the linens and comforter were impressive.
__label__1 if you're looking for a high end hotel i suggest you go somewhere else.
__label__0 And it is far, very far, from being even one of the top 5-6 resorts in the area.
__label__0 A buddy and I were out pretty late one night drinking and having a great time.
__label__0 Even the breakfast is a feast for the eyes (as well as the stomach).
__label__0 Light soothing decor.
__label__0 The front desk employees were rude, whether it was on the phone or in person, didn't matter.
__label__0 Given the low cost of internet access and PC hardware, all decent hotels now offer such 'business centre' services for free - here,
__label__0 The S-ban  The U-ban are also very close.
__label__0 Nize size rooms with adequate bath.
__label__0 Westin St Francis is a stunning hotel overall
__label__0 We moved to the second desk clerk when she was free and were told that our reservation could not be found.
__label__0 The actual hotel is very nice and has a quite expensive feel about it
__label__0 The hotel staff was excellent in making it a non-issue.
__label__0 Then after telling htem to come back later.
__label__0 This hotel is actually closer to Chinatown than it is to the Financial District.
__label__0 The Warwick apparently thinks a few bucks (from milking conventioneers) is worth ticking off a few Entertainment book users.
__label__0 Hotel is well-situated near main attractions, restaurants and shopping.
__label__0 But of course, since its one of the least expensive hotels in South Beach, its not exactly a high end experience.
__label__0 What can I say, a simple pleasure of mine is to enjoy the lotions, etc. that the hotel provides.
__label__0 On first look at the place from the outside ,I knew it wasnt going to be Buckingham Palace.
__label__0 BUT, this hotel made NO mention of any renovations on their website.
__label__1 If you go on this trip bring items from your dollar stores ,pencils, markers, coloring books, for gifts for these children and watch their reactions.
__label__0 Overall, a great hotel in a city where Im sure its easy to pick a bad one.
__label__0 Head waiters from the restaurants to take the order mostly unfriendly - no smile.
__label__0 There is an exercise room which we did not use ,got enough exercise on the San Francisco hills,
__label__0 I was really impressed with their renovated modern lobby,
__label__0 The layout of the furniture was spartan at best.
__label__0 City buses just waiting at the bus stop could be heard running in the room all night long.
__label__0 The whole pool is 4 feet deep -- no shallow or deep end.
__label__0 They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner there.
__label__0 Food is mostly where the Majestic loses 1 star.
__label__0 and anyone can open it or take it.
__label__0 I have been to Punta Cana 3 times and hands down the food at this resort has got to be the BEST.
__label__0 that same awful smell would drift by.
__label__0 We went in early.
__label__1 Hilton - stay on executive floor (great lounge) get a room overlooking the Gendarmenmarkt (beautiful day and night).
__label__0 It made me feel uncomfortable both times that I had to witness such rude behavior from the staff, and that would just lead me to believe that this hotel, quite frankly, does not like kids or value them as guests.
__label__0 Check-in was a breeze, but the $54/day rate for valet parking was a turn-off.
__label__0 Dont promise me something that I paid for and I expect to get and then not deliver because its the off season, or your not at full capacity.
__label__0 and the Westin was booked out where i had been staying for 5 nights.
__label__0 We booked this hotel through Hotwire, which was misleading, as it listed this hotel as a Pike Street Market hotel.
__label__0 Secure parking is available in the garage next door for 11 euros a day.
__label__0 The front desk staff were both professional and friendly.
__label__0 Not a huge issue but worth noting.
__label__0 We only ate breakfast only once in the hotel, and the waitress (a mature lady) started off by giving our children (who were sitting quitely) a lecture about behaving and being good for their parents.
__label__0 We booked this hotel through priceline at a very low rate.
__label__0 As soon as they see the hotel ristband they try and charge you the highest price in the word.
__label__0 My husband smokes, but I do not,
__label__0 The two things that really did it for me were the beds ,very comfortable and we loved the flannel sheets,
__label__0 I complained at the Reception and all they did was only noting it down, they did not apology and the matter did not seem to suprise them.
__label__0 She offered to, take care of my parking during my stay.
__label__1 I can recommend a Turkish restaurant in Wilton Road called Mezze ,but book in advance if you want to have dinner there as its quite busy,.
__label__0 My only 2 complaints are:-1. Whilst the aquarium is positioned in the hotel lobby/bar area it is not actually part of the hotel but belongs to the Aqua Dom next door.
__label__0 and in the same condition as you'd find in a Travelodge.
__label__0 Le Gourmet was good.
__label__0 It certainly wouldnt keep us from staying there again.
__label__0 The upholstery and curtains in our room needed cleaning andpressing There was a sign in the bathroom about water conservation;
__label__0 I would be willing to stay here again the future if the price was significantly lower than the nearby four-star competition.
__label__0 Everything you would expect from a Hilton and MORE
__label__0 We were provided a complimentary upgrade on our room type (without our asking) when the front desk noted that they had room to do so.
__label__0 The room was very nice and clean.
__label__0 I had called the Starwood reservations line directly in July and asked which of the Starwood hotels in Seattle had the best pool, picked the Sheraton based on their advice, told my daughter that she could go swimming,
__label__0 We had to air out our suitcases.
__label__0 All in all a very big disappointment!
__label__0 We went to a shop ran by someone from Montreal, it is free to go..
__label__0 Room modern but showing signs of wear  tear - not quality furnishings.
__label__0 The service was so awesome that we almost expected the same wherever we went ---we were really spoilt and in for a surprise as we moved around Old San Juan.
__label__0 There were 6 ladies all together and this room gave us plenty of room to get ready and sleep.
__label__1 If they offer you something that is expensive just bargain with them and start walking out of the store and they will bargain with you.
__label__0 Amenities Part of the reason we selected the hotel was because it advertised having a pool and hot-tub.
__label__0 First, he was on his cell phone at the concierge desk and seemed annoyed that we interrupted him.
__label__0 The hotel employee was very nice and said that May is a slow month so the scuba employees decided to take a job all week repairing a reef that had been badly damaged.
__label__0 The location is the best thing about this hotel - only minutes from Circular Quay, close to the Opera House and steps from great restaurants and cafes.
__label__0 We were travelling with 2 small children (57) so booked one room for us all.
__label__0 The windows were dressed with acres more white muslin and luxuriously draped curtains.
__label__0 We didnt always get there early or leave towels on the chairs and we were still able to find palapa covered seating, it just would take a lil bit of walking back and forth and possibly sitting in an area too far from the water or the bar.
__label__0 Besides their convenient location, I would mention that the attentiveness, friendliness, and efficiency of the staff with whom we interacted were consistently excellent, and it is this, more than anything, that prompts me to give more than one star.
__label__0 Who could ask for more?
__label__0 However the staff is helpful and provide you with towels, dressing gown and sandals (to avoid you slipping on the floor).
__label__0 If you wish to hear more details, please contact us and we will be glad to provide them.
__label__0 The manager should have been promoted long ago,-I will never again meet such a Man who was so happy to help and rectify any problems- he was wonderful.
__label__0 Room was very clean.
__label__0 However, the maids burst into our room twice on the day we were checking out.
__label__0 I found the decor and atmosphere very relaxing in the lobby area.
__label__0 just ok The hotel had nice grounds, and some nice art.
__label__0 By the time you add all the extras, I could've stayed at the Red Lion or Hotel Monaco for only slightly more.
__label__0 and you have to change trains twice to get to Zoo Station which has connections to most places
__label__0 Could be a real gem since it is an older property/building and could get some of its original character back with some renovating, and better front desk staff.
__label__0 I never saw anyone walking around picking up garbage either.
__label__0 but it's only 5 blocks from Pike Place and roughly a 20 min walk to the Harbor Steps.
__label__0 We just think that the hotel does not deserve five stars.
__label__0 and fast--there were always at least 3 people at the front desk.
__label__1 So dont always think that booking early is the best.
__label__0 It would be ideal if you have friends or family in the other suite.
__label__0 so you have to take itThis is no 5-star hotel.
__label__0 Its really good to be able to walk out the back of the hotel and right onto the beach or onto the beachfront walkway for biking or rollerblading, and its rare in SoBe unless youre paying top dollar.
__label__1 Would advise taking a stroll in the opposite direction to La Rambla and exploring the area were you will stumble across the most wonderful bars and restaurants at much better value.
__label__0 The wash basin was also located in the bedroom ,not in the bathroom, which struck me as odd and does not help matters when one person is an earlier riser than another.
__label__0 I usually have a terrible night's sleep in a hotel, but had a great sleep two nights in a row.
__label__0 The chef is outstanding.
__label__0 We arranged to have Arecibo pick us up - the fee to the hotel was $50 plus tip.
__label__0 We were underwhelmed with check-in.
__label__0 All in all , very good value for money , especially considering the saving on taxis which can amount to almost the price per day for this hotel
__label__0 concierge was helpful.
__label__0 Friendly staff, great location
__label__0 This is a basic, modern, no frills hotel.
__label__0 Well, we turned on my laptop and Tmobile came up.
__label__0 Our first two trips to this hotel were both Christmas trips (2005 and 2006)
__label__0 but as the place isn't cheap to begin with and it claims to be 5 star why the difference between this and other 5 star operations in Berlin?
__label__1 but don't expect too much.
__label__0 The bathroom is really nice sized considering the size of the room; plenty large enough for two people to navigate in.
__label__0 I was not happy about this but since we were starving our main priority was to eat.
__label__0 Wages are the same, and cost of living is very high here unlike most destinations in the Carribean, so dont expect to come here and rack up on some over priced brand name purses, because everything is priced basically the same as in the states.
__label__0 The hotel itself is very lovely.
__label__0 The rooms have a modern bathroom with shower, flat screen TV, a safe in the wardrobe, a mini-bar and tea/coffee making facilities.
__label__0 To sum up, the holiday from beginning to end was perfect.
__label__0 As previous posts mentioned, there was a continuous draft through the sliding glass door since it wouldn't close all the way.
__label__0 The staff are absolutely lovely.
__label__0 The bathroom was spacious and immaculate also with the novelty of having a speaker system built in allowing you to listen to the TV while in the bath.
__label__0 It also has AC.
__label__0 We were told to open the internet page and follow instructions to sign up for internet.
__label__0 I would say one thing though, coming home when its dark to the hotel is quite off putting as its not very busy at all and very dark in places
__label__0 If I had known what we would get, I would have asked for a room with a large window.
__label__0 I chose the Francisco Bay because it locates near the Fisherman warf with free parking space, and affordable price.
__label__0 There are certainly better places to eat in Seattle,
__label__0 I have to say its amenities and services were great.
__label__0 Granted, its on the pricey end if youre a budget traveler, but I think you get your moneys worth if accommodations and service are important to you.
__label__0 Were off to Perth now.
__label__0 Felt like a weekend away from the wife and kids (more wife than kids to be honest- I know she wont read this !!) Chose Seattle to do this, as its within easy reach of my hometown Vancouver.
__label__0 On the other hand, this inflexible halfwall must be a major obstacle for the room ladies when they're cleaning the upper part of the tub.
__label__0 We originally found this hotel in Nov 2005 through the Rick Steves travel book, and we loved the location.
__label__0 Staff marvelous and very patient with my bad German though reception staff and many others spoke good English.
__label__0 It was at this time we tried to contact the Air Transat Holidays representative for Punta Cana, she did not answer at the number we had been given at any time between 7:30 to10:00 pm.
__label__0 I asked to switch rooms and they did give me a bit of a hard time saying I did have a pool view.
__label__0 Great sound system for docking ipod.
__label__0 It was free so we did it.
__label__0 but we had to put up with where we were...
__label__0 Spent five nights and enjoyed the spacious and spotless very bright rooms, modern steam and sauna area with cold plunge, and complete breakfast buffet.
__label__0 The staff were very helpful;
__label__0 I really didn't want to complain.
__label__0 (We tried the last part and they didn't care)
__label__1 No snorkeling right on the hotels beach ,too many waves and no reef,, so you have to book a separate excursion.
__label__0 the fantastic promo they had on their website ($129 + tax for the weekend) and the location.
__label__0 I was not disappointed.
__label__0 My next favorite was the Spanish, which had great selection and atmosphere ,note that the drawback to the Brasilian was the LACK of atmosphere - no music, glaring lights,.
__label__0 Only small gripes would be, no pool and tiny Gym.
__label__0 You are in walking distance ,minutes, to Bourbon Street, Canal Street, and the French Market.
__label__0 The concierge was very helpful in booking us a rental car.
__label__0 We played the KoOlina golf course and it is well worth it
__label__0 I would agree that sometimes the standard isnt great all the time, but they do at least make the effort, which is half the point in my opinion.
__label__0 The hotel also has a nice hot tub, work out room, and pool in the basement level.
__label__1 but a bit pricey 19euros since you can have a decent breakfest in any Kaffee in Berlin.
__label__0 As others have described its an old place and in need of an update but its fine for the money.
__label__0 Scrambled eggs, breakfast meat, cereals, yogurt, bagels, muffins, oatmeal, Starbucks coffee and Tazo teas...all made for a great start-up meal.
__label__0 Enjoyed the hospitality and helpfulness of the Savoy Berlin staff.
__label__1 Note that the hotel offers great packages on its website - the best way to go.
__label__0 There was constant activity on the beach and just off shore.
__label__0 Breakfast was on until 11 every morning and had a great selection from scrambled eggs to pastries.
__label__0 Very refined Got a great deal on the internet ,40% off advertised rates, and used it as a one night stopover en route back to Heathrow.
__label__0 All in all we were very happy with our choice and recommend it to our friends.
__label__0 Then on checkout, there was yet another mess.
__label__1 If you want to rent a car, rent it at the airport, not the resort
__label__0 The room had a small balcony overlooking Park Avenue South and 26th Street.
__label__0 It has some good points - for example, it's cheaper than other options in downtown Seattle and it's in a decent location.
__label__0 Travelled with my wife and two friends to New York to see the St Patricks day parade.
__label__0 The whirlpool was out of this world.
__label__0 We experienced impeccable service, our room was cleaned to perfection each day and our mini- fridge was well stocked an extra dollar or 2 here and there gets you extras such as extra coffee and towels.
__label__0 This hotel should not be allowed to call itself a Sofitel as the rooms are well below standard, the staff however are right up there.
__label__0 The queen sized bed on one wall with a small desk on one side and a small nightstand on the other.
__label__0 great experience except... ...for the concierge problem.
__label__0 Bad Service for Up-Scale Hotel
__label__0 I was also given a smoking room.
__label__0 He recommended the restaurant Stamhouse which is part of the hotel.
__label__0 The doormen were consistently friendly.
__label__0 Hmmm, basic info a concierge should know.
__label__0 A cab from/to the airport is about $30. They have a generic shuttle that runs through a string of different hotels for $18 round trip pp.
__label__0 It's on several major bus lines that'll take you just about anywhere in the city.
__label__0 A few years had past since my last visit to the Ritz-Carlton Phoenix and I was impressed on how fresh and revived the hotel was.
__label__0 This hotel ruined not only my weekend, but my vacation and the relaxation I hoped to get.
__label__1 so you don't have to walk if you don't want to.
__label__0 Upon check-in we were upgraded to a corner room on the 30th floor.
__label__0 We were to get a free continental breakfast each morning.
__label__0 The rooms themselves were adequate
__label__0 It was the perfect location for shopping,too.
__label__0 The staff were very helpful and friendly and the buffet breakfast in the relaxing dining room was excellent.
__label__0 That's the worst of it.
__label__0 the price and the location.
__label__0 the staff cant do enough for you and are so polite.
__label__0 and we did have a lovely room with two very comfy beds, a flat screen tv and a nice bathroom.
__label__0 The concierge desk in the lobby is excellent
__label__0 and we were given a room promptly even
__label__0 great hotel 14 of us stayed here for a hen weekend our stay was almost faultless.
__label__0 and this is essential as the hotel's proximity to a very still tributary to the Spree means that the area is plagued by large, voracious mosquitoes.
__label__0 Turndown service at night was nice ,Ghiradelli chocolate on the pillow, fresh ice, robes laid out,, and the doormen and valets were extremely helpful with restaurant suggestions and directions.
__label__0 The 2nd time we stayed we were upgraded to what was called a deluxe room - larger then the room we had before and it also had some other features like tea/coffee, a wardrobe and side tables.
__label__0 The lunch is taken on the rice terraces and staff come from the hotel to prepare it for you.One word of warning our party occupied 2 rooms and both rooms had small items disappear from them during our stay.
__label__0 however, our guide book had a listing of six special places for breakfast in Berlin.
__label__0 I agree with previous posters that the staff is nice and the location very convenient.
__label__0 Two days after the ordeal with the Newport Beachside Resort I was on my way home, and decided to pull money out of my account for the turnpike home.
__label__0 The bathroom had had the tiles painted to give the appearance of a newly refurbished room.
__label__0 The room was about the normal size for Europe (i.e. small),
__label__0 The hike to the convention center is not horrible, but longer than I anticipated, especially in long pants at 2:00 in the afternoon.
__label__0 Breakfast lackluster.
__label__0 They offered me "points"
__label__0 Not big with the young, single crowd.
__label__0 too much money for oh so little
__label__0 I hope that this is usefull to everybody.
__label__0 When I arrived on Sunday afternoon I was the only person in the lobby/reception area.
__label__0 We were very dissapointed: Noisy (nightclub next to building, busy street),
__label__0 One week passed and no phone call.
__label__0 Great for the younger 30 something crowd.
__label__0 Instead they told us that we were in their sister hotel for 1 night.
__label__0 The only fault we would find is in the lack of tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms.
__label__0 What you do get, though, is a heck of a deal.
__label__0 The rooms are very comfortable with a beautifully done separate bathroom.
__label__0 Staff _��_ Reception desk staff were fine,
__label__0 We ate all our meals off premises, so I can not comment on the in hotel restaurant other than it was very expensive.
__label__0 We stayed a slow weekend in January and got an $80/night rate.
__label__0 The check-in man then rang the hotel's reservation office
__label__0 Brilliant Berlin base
__label__0 We were told to make the reservation at the Customer Relations desk.
__label__0 To the concierge problem...we dealt with three concierges during our stays.
__label__0 The doors are very thin and need some insulation.
__label__0 The room was huge, while sparsely decorated.
__label__1 I highly recommend this hotel for families and/or friends who want to hang out together instead of booking small separate rooms.
__label__0 It was very comfortable, warm and secure (which in Belltown is always an issue)
__label__0 It was our first trip to NYC and this was the ideal location, centrally located to tour the city.
__label__0 Its cold , clinical, joyless. 
__label__0 The rooms are well appointed and spacious.
__label__0 My mother and I stayed at the Warwick for 2 nights in November.
__label__0 I had been given vouchers for a continental breakfast at check-in.
__label__0 and her friends could see a concert there.
__label__0 I let it go since it was, afterall, our vacation and I did not feel like fighting with someone.
__label__0 was slightly cautious after reviews on here but was more than happy with what we ended up with - room was fine, perfectly large enough for European tastes.
__label__0 However, what should have been the best part of our vacation the time in Punta Cana fell far short of our expectations, because of the inferior food service and inadequate service at the beach.
__label__0 We were staying at the Pan Pacific for our anniversary and booked our trip through priceline.
__label__0 For example, our 1st day there, not once in 7 days was the ride available at any time.
__label__0 This can get rather annoying, but the people are friendly enough,.
__label__0 We enjoyed the ocean bavaro.
__label__0 I'd definitely stay here again.
__label__0 Plus they had rigged some type of showerhead using a bath faucet.
__label__0 We are unsure, at times, if ANYONE was managing the resort.
__label__0 My daughter is currently contemplating colleges.
__label__0 Secure parking was a nice plus.
__label__0 The only downside of the hotel is that our room faced the side stree ,Eddy?,
__label__0 There is a very nice Spa in the basement with small pool, sauna, steamroom and other therapy spa options.
__label__0 Room was spacious with giant TV and bathroom.
__label__0 Bottom line - this is a terrific place.
__label__0 The hotel has tables and chairs right on the Grand Canal, and a shady area to the side under two large sun shades.
__label__0 It is perhaps a bit old fashioned but very comfortable.
__label__0 We were forced to pay $10 for a bottle of Evian in the bar one night because there is just nothing near by on foot.
__label__0 This is wonderful hotel-finished to a high standard.
__label__0 On the good side :No People tresspassing past your door when you eventually get back ,My Room,.
__label__0 In the few hours we were there we didnt even see there was a minibar.
__label__0 It is well situated and has an impressive lobby,
__label__0 Located on a very safe street in Chelsea...steps away from many restaurants and cafes.
__label__0 Loved it.
__label__0 Amenities include a tub and heater lamp, A/C and heat, hair dryer, robes and slippers, and complimentary daily newspaper.
__label__0 We turned on the heater and waited for 3 hours, the room never got warm.....apparently the windows were not sealed.
__label__0 Room was clean, and the new Hilton comfort bed sheets were very nice.
__label__0 The positives on the room are that is was a large room, king bed was nice, it was also very clean.
__label__0 and she credited $75 against my hotel bill.
__label__0 No way you can trust what you order is what you get.
__label__0 This Hotel is located just two blocks from the Pacific Science Center and the Space Needle.
__label__0 Drink prices in the reception bar were high by comparrison with other 5 star Berlin hotels with which we are familiar.
__label__0 The lobby staff where not all that helpful, they couldn't tell me how to turn out an annoying light in my room, or the cost of the movie service.
__label__0 and the pool smells like mildew.
__label__0 Breakfast was a bit better, and we realize this is not fast food, America, etcetera..
__label__0 and serious emphasis must be placed on the 'once'.
__label__0 and the major central tourist attractions are within easy reach.
__label__0 Little Gem and close to all you want to see in Madrid
__label__1 Room was big, bath was lovely, but watch out for the tile floor after you shower.
__label__1 Dont expect ANYTHING to be included.
__label__0 I understand that most hotels downtown have paid parking,
__label__0 It was our first time in Seattle
__label__0 And since the hotel needs renovation,
__label__0 I had no idea there were so many nurses with a night life in New York
__label__0 The staff are efficient and very polite and helpful.
__label__0 That evening we reserved a table for the Fish Buffet for 8pm.
__label__1 Stay in courtyard room-very quiet.
__label__1 Be sure to pick up an umbrella (for free) at the concierge if you anticipate rain while sightseeing.
__label__1 YOu do have to shop around on the newt to get best deal.
__label__0 That room was much larger but with worn and dirty carpet.
__label__0 The staff was friendly and helpful, especially at the concierge desk.
__label__0 Every morning there is free breakfast and very polite assistance.
__label__0 We had an enjoyable stay, it wasnt terrible, but I wouldnt be inclined to stay at that hotel again.
__label__0 I visit to walk around, to shop, to drink coffee and to see the water.
__label__0 The rooms were clean and the location of the hotel was great.
__label__0 and so the room can get quite warm especially in the evening.
__label__0 Stay - 4 nights / 4 days. Location _��_ Located just off the Gendarmenarkt (square that has the concert hall, and the German and French Cathedrals).
__label__0 so the room and breakfast were included in the award,
__label__0 The waitstaff in both the bar and hotel were attentive.
__label__0 We got a room on the first floor, used the 2 lifts initially which look more like detention cells, walked through the dark and very green hallway to our room.
__label__0 We stayed at Hotel Renew for four nights, December 22 - 26, 2008.
__label__0 There are power boats, sail boats para sails up and down the beach.
__label__0 There is an 8 pm light show at the harbor every night.
__label__1 Cleanliness is not a priority in this area - so go with that in mind.
__label__0 I try to get the best value for my stay and will always be willing to pay a bit more if I think its worth it.
__label__0 I would have assumed that after their first mistake they'll sort their records but it never happened.
__label__0 but the food was OK
__label__0 We found the staff very helpful and pleasant.
__label__0 The staff, on the other hand, was not pleasant or helpful.
__label__0 So much is within walking distance,
__label__0 Cant fault it...
__label__0 Furnishings were dated and floors were dirty.
__label__0 I did not find the hotel to be noisy,
__label__0 This time, our room was in an L-shaped configuration.
__label__0 Frankly I still dont know what they were saying, aside from implying that I am an idiot.
__label__0 I complained at reception
__label__0 The walls are not thin.
__label__0 We had refurbished room which was clean, huge and very comfortable.
__label__0 Everything from spare toothbrushes, razors , shower caps, shoe polishing sponges and a very handy sewing kit.
__label__0 It became a joke that every day we had to go to Mary Jane to figure out what we were going to do and where we were going to eat
__label__0 It was spectacular
__label__0 Its Easy's responsibility.
__label__0 What was not so good is the fact that you cannot open the windows yourself, and they turned of the airco as it was getting cold outside.
__label__0 I wish the staff well but the rest of it was terrible.
__label__0 Stayed recenty to attend a Giants game.
__label__0 The bathroom was cramped compared to what the Alexis offered,
__label__0 Also I wonder how a whole family would manage in this tiny bathroom.
__label__0 We did Zip Lining which was great and the caribean festival catamaran.
__label__0 We were never mistreated, we just often werent treated at all.
__label__0 A fun time though and the opportunity to see and get a feel for the local people.
__label__0 Efficient and friendly staff.
__label__1 Be sure to get the larger room and have breakfast included as it is $25 if you pay.
__label__0 The landscaping was very beautiful and well groomed.
__label__1 There really is no good wine choice and if you are a wine drinker, bring your own.
__label__0 We also felt very safe.
__label__0 When we go back we will probably stay there to get some variety.
__label__0 But the location was just unacceptable for a pleasure trip.
__label__0 Takethe lift to the second floor, and you will receive a hearty welcome.
__label__0 The front desk was very, very rude; cutting my sentences off midway to tell me that it didn't matter what I was told,
__label__0 Stayed during a business meeting; was upgraded to a club level room.
__label__0 but this was the first time we stayed at the Sheraton.
__label__0 For the price you pay this resort is awesome.
__label__0 When I mentioned my knee surgery (cane was the tip-off), they made a big show of reluctantly upgarding me to a double on another floor.
__label__0 Simply - THE BEST
__label__0 The room was fabulous too.
__label__0 Several of us stayed there
__label__0 the hotel is near Alexander Platz,
__label__0 Best Hotel Ive Stayed
__label__0 I always book in advance and pay with my credit card.
__label__0 If you have been living in Hong kong peninsula you know it is totally different thing.
__label__0 We stopped in Hawaii on our way to and from Australia Dec 2007-Jan 2008.
__label__0 It has always exceeded our expectations.
__label__0 We were very pleased with our stay and would definitely stay there again.
__label__0 There is no non-smoking section in the bar and quite frankly, if you are not a smoker yourself,
__label__0 The photos on their website come close but in person it is something else.
__label__0 This hotel is also dog-friendly,
__label__1 It wasn't just us, so beware, if you book at the Warwick, you will eventually get a beautiful room hopefully, but may need to deal with some not-so-nice staff to get it.
__label__0 We breezed through US immigration and our cases were there as we approached the carousel.
__label__1 Top tip for frequent visitors is the Okura Club International which you can join for nothing and entitles bearers to free usage of the pool, showers and o-furo ,bath, which you would normally have to pay for.
__label__0 I did not feel safe at this hotel.
__label__0 The only reason I give a 4/5 stars is the ridiculous parking cost.
__label__0 Needless to say, all higher-price rooms offer these
__label__0 Room was decent size for a European hotel
__label__0 It was nice but we explored the older tower
__label__0 I just booked our room on hotwire and was disappointed as soon as I saw the hotel.
__label__0 The concierge was useless, un-helpful and a waste of time.
__label__0 The concierge staff is the best in the world.
__label__0 The breakfast was yukky.
__label__0 clean and had a nice view down to the road.
__label__0 Our room was clean,
__label__0 The hotel is very central to a lot of good shopping centres, Pike Street Market, and lot of great restaurants.
__label__0 In fact BOTH receptionists on Thursday afternoon were very surly and discourteous
__label__0 We called ahead because we specifically needed two beds for medical reasons.
__label__0 First of all, it is in the ghetto part of DT Seattle.
__label__0 Sounded good in theory.
__label__0 My rate included continental breakfast, but had to tell the front desk again who finally gave me the vouchers.
__label__0 The breakast buffet was too expensive for our liking,
__label__1 Stay away from this hotel, if you really need to be downtown stay in a well known chain for a few extra bucks, your peace of mind will be worth it.
__label__0 Walking to nearly every sight in Seattle was a breeze.
__label__0 Excellent bartenders.
__label__0 Cons:There was no view but the windows did open for a little fresh air.
__label__0 ugly inside, nice outside ,nice location, aaaaahh
__label__0 She totally ignored the do-not-disturb sign
__label__0 THATS NOT A SUITE....THATS A LOAD OF CRAP.
__label__0 Wont stay here again
__label__0 It is very difficult to put into words - we have stayed in many Hotels which provide equally as good rooms, clean beds and showers, a pleasant ambiance, friendly staff and are situated in good locations.
__label__0 There are two sets of elevators depending on which floor you are on
__label__0 The hotel claim that this is a standard room for two is based upon the size of the bed which nearly fills the space of the room.
__label__0 Perfect-especially considering it was 8 at home in Michigan.
__label__0 I will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and stay again when I return to New Orleans.
__label__0 The menu looked great, but was pricey.
__label__0 FoodIm not really picky so I thought the food was fine as did my bf.
__label__0 but I will never patronize another Sheraton establishment.
__label__0 Great location The Hotel
__label__0 Well I don't agree with that
__label__0 We booked our stay for the Easter weekend in a standard room.
__label__0 The rooms are exceptionally clean and inviting.
__label__0 My ten year old wouldnt go in due to it being too full.
__label__0 The location is absolutely ideal for a tourist trip to Berlin.
__label__0 Most of the reviews stated that the staff was very helpful and friendly.
__label__0 And if you've always wanted to be a bellboy,
__label__0 It is very clean and yet has the rustic appeal of the oldbusiness it used to be.
__label__0 The weather outside was cold and rainy, but the weather in the suites at the Bryant Park was heavenly
__label__0 but it lacks character and charm.
__label__0 They gave me the run around and said an opening came up.
__label__0 There is no police presence except at the metro turnstiles, where theyre trying to deter farebeaters; apparently the Spanish police dont care that tourists are being preyed upon.
__label__0 This hotel was conveniently located, though not on the beach.
__label__0 It also had a wet bar with mini bar fridge under the sink.
__label__0 Marriott seems to be adding fancy, high speed elevators to its large hotels.
__label__0 Upon entering, the entire lobby is under construction, so you have to lug your stuff up an escalator to the temporary lobby on the second floor.
__label__0 This was a pleasant ,safe ,place to stay where the parking was free and yet short walk to Canairie Wharf/cable cars.
__label__0 therefore pretty much ruining our vacation along with many other peoples.
__label__1 Dont open curtains as you will only view filthy windows.
__label__0 I have no qualms about staying Kowloon side the hotels tend to be cheaper.
__label__0 Ambassador recently with a couple friends.
__label__0 Transportation notes: there were 4 of us traveling from JFK with at least 8 bags.
__label__0 We arranged our stay through a travel agency
__label__1 But if you are on holiday there are sum negatives.
__label__0 After getting a room on the 41st floor and a great recommendation for a sports bar around the corner, the quality of the service went down hill.
__label__0 It had a full Kitchen, dining room area, bedroom with 2 beds and pull out couch.
__label__0 A Wonderful Resort GRAN BRAHIA
__label__0 It was fine.
__label__1 You may be well advised to try another address...
__label__0 I am not a small person and the bathroom in the ecomony room suited my needs fine.
__label__0 Plenty of food to choose from, some you may like, some you may not.
__label__0 Room _��_ Room was OK,
__label__0 The one which decreased the value of this hotel is that the lobby is up a flight of stairs.
__label__1 Also, a warning, be careful of what you sign up for as wireless internet.
__label__0 Hard to say.
__label__0 What do some people want!
__label__0 We ate at the bar one night, primarily for convenience.
__label__0 There was no concierge
__label__0 Room was small - no bath  the shower room was very small with a tiny corner shower.
__label__0 and the staff were super.
__label__0 Because all beaches in Hawaii are public, it is no problem to use the Kuhio Beach or the Queens Beach ,just two blocks from the hotel to the South,.
__label__0 He didnt offer to have us check another room or to investigate our concerns with the original room.
__label__0 My room had a 42 inch plasma t.v. which was nice.
__label__0 She provided us insight on where to go and what to do, helped us book reservations at the hottest restaurants and used her connections to get us it.
__label__0 My take on it is that the sewer system put in by the GDR needs to be replaced.
__label__0 We had no food related sicknesses during our trip.
__label__0 You just have to pull up and get dropped off.
__label__1 If you can, upgrade to an Ocean Front Room
__label__0 The hotel was overrun with meetings and groups.
__label__0 Items that were served for dinner the night before reappeared for lunch with a sauce on it.
__label__0 and only discovered that this was the case when I tried to take a shower.
__label__0 I would have rated it higher and Im very picky about hotel accomodations.
__label__0 We booked through Apple Vacations and their staff was competent and helpful.
__label__0 It was like a 3-star hotel -- of the Quality Inn level.
__label__0 and most Spanish people smoke!
__label__0 I had the doughnuts!!!
__label__0 Some areas of the hotel need upgrading.
__label__0 Easy access to highways.
__label__0 Too much noise from other ruede guests with no manner which came home between 4am and 5am in the morning and talked for one hour in front of their room.
__label__1 Tip choose a floor above the tenth floor for great views.
__label__0 I have stayed in this hotel twice.
__label__0 The room had a very poor shower that trickled out water.
__label__0 Now, the only negative about this room...the shower.
__label__0 The bar and lobby area is great for kicking back - quite small
__label__0 and a very good value considering the rate we got through priceline.com,
__label__0 I've had better help at Motel 6 -- and they don't charge anything for internet or boxes.
__label__0 There was so much demand that all spots available were filled before 9:00am.
__label__0 My husband and I stayed here for a quick weekend trip and besides the location were not all that impressed.
__label__0 Great massage
__label__0 It kills me when people put in these reviews about no hot water and a long check in etc.
__label__0 At the resort there is photo studio.
__label__0 while we went to Momma's Mexican a few blocks away.
__label__0 You couldnt just walk down and go to the beach.
__label__0 I said I doubted that and said that I was expecting a fax.
__label__0 BIg stain on room rug.
__label__0 The shower in the bathroom simply sprayed water everywhere in the APART HOTEL (read falling APART Hotel) causing the bathroom floor to flood and cause a very dangerous health  safety hazardBreakfast in the Mark Hotel in Meineke Strasse was absolutely chaotic with surly, rude staff who snapped at you if you asked them to bring tea or coffee pots or more orange juice or bread fort oast.
__label__0 Small, but sexy room
__label__0 I always stay in the rooms with a shared bath
__label__0 but this turned out to be a bottle of German sekt when it arrived.
__label__0 and even after me asking if I could speak with somebody else and being TOLD to take a seat in the bar as it would take a
__label__0 Food _��_ Breakfast _��_ Only had breakfast on the last day _��_ good spread, fresh and presented well.
__label__0 The front desk compensated us with 3 $15 food credits for the bedding problems, which were never corrected.
__label__0 We asked a lot of the staff during the week and they graciously accommodated every request.
__label__0 If not, stay away.
__label__0 We were in Seattle for a meeting at the convention center and it was right across the street.
__label__0 Close to museum island and U-ban just outside hotel.
__label__0 Fantastic breakfast with an incredible selection of meats, cheeses, yogurts, breads etc. And, as a non-German speaker,
__label__0 In the morning, breakfast turned out to be chaos with other guests stood with plates of food but nowhere to sit as not enough room.
__label__0 Great location when we eventually found it
__label__0 We ordered pizza one night, and it never came, nor did we see our waiter after ordering d the situation.
__label__0 My stay at the Andra was exceptional.
__label__0 The lobby is really fun with a computer area, lots of comfortable seating,
__label__0 I was waiting 10 min at the erception desk for the guy to figure out whether there was a clean room available or not.
__label__0 All in all it was adequate for what we needed.
__label__0 The point is - don't advertise the service if there are caveats that go with it.
__label__0 The room I was moved to was tiny, cramped and dark, and the view looked out on to a lower rooftop, where at 6 am,
__label__0 We were given room 205 with a huge balcony over the main entrance of the hotel, huge bedroom and living room for the same price we paid for a small room in Rome.
__label__0 The hotel also has a mini general store right in the lobby and their mark-up on items was not bad at all.
__label__0 but we were not offered refills once during breakfast.
__label__1 You must use these or risk breaking your leg.
__label__0 It is a short cab ride to Time Square, 5th Avenue, and all the shopping areas.
__label__0 Everything about the place is warm, no regular upstarts telling you to get in line.
__label__0 and their non-valet parking is $28 a night and a block away.
__label__0 We loved this hotel in downtown Seattle.
__label__0 This gives you the basic idea of the city and you can get on and off the trolley.
__label__0 The room is small ,the width of the room is the length of a kingsized bed,, but it is so well laid out, you would hardly notice the size.
__label__0 but it may cost to connect in the room.
__label__0 They appeared not to want to help you, and was always a real effort engaging with them.
__label__0 Nice room although small.
__label__0 The room was average size for amsterdam, the breakfast very nice, usual toast, ham, cheese, jam etc, and the place was very clean.
__label__0 The prices in the bar are approx.
__label__0 Service was excellent.
__label__0 We slept in every day so we did not try the breakfast.
__label__0 They dont have water systems like we do.
__label__1 at bar called vang gogh the owner play piano.....try the dada falafel at oranien str, and cafe einstein.
__label__0 I know I can count on that at Bryant Park.
__label__0 All in all not the usual Radisson service.
__label__0 I can say that I was happy to see that the lobby
__label__1 Just hope that you get there to get a room ahead of someone else!
__label__0 We didnt try the restaurant as we prefer to eat out
__label__0 Regardless, there are a few good things to mention.
__label__0 the cardio room was nice
__label__0 A few interesting things I noticed, lots of people smoking,
__label__0 They seemed to know next to nothing about the property or the city,
__label__0 You can hear a lot of noise from the street until late night.
__label__1 So if you are wanting a pool I dont suggest booking here.
__label__0 Substitute hotel was poorly located for us and, as a consequence, our first break to Berlin was ruined.
__label__0 The location is great right near the Embarcadero with the ferry building and all the shops.
__label__0 It was a comfortable, spotlessly clean, well located hotel, great value for the price we paid (an online special summer rate).
__label__0 After reporting the loss of a key , no problems with reception thank goodness,
__label__0 They also only dumped the garbage, they did not replace the lining.
__label__0 For dinner we tried the Japaneese, Le Gourmet, Rodeo Steakhouse and main buffet.
__label__0 Our only complaints concerned the front desk.
__label__0 Yes, breakfast is a little busy, but come on folks, be patient!
__label__0 Stayed here about 3 times in the past four years.
__label__0 but clearly it had not been cleaned after the last guest.
__label__0 Needless to say, breakfast that day, and each subsequent day was cafe au lait and beignets at Cafe du Monde.  YUM
__label__0 I had to stay at this hotel for two weeks for my job
__label__0 I was charged for 3 nights rather than just 2.
__label__0 When we arrived at the hotel, the reception staff appeared to be very unhelpful, I would say to state they were not friendly would be an understatement.
__label__1 The shuttle isnt regular enough, and the town of Ubud is fantastic - loads of lovely restaurants, and quiet away from the main streets - I would really recommend staying in the town.
__label__0 We stayed 4 nights here on a first visit to Berlin.
__label__0 and service it is right downtown convenient for walking.
__label__0 Alternatively it's around __�_8 in a taxi.
__label__0 breakfast fantastic, as everyone has said before, and ate drank around the pool most days - certainly no complaints, and given the decent GBP/USD rate no complaints re prices.
__label__0 The only complaint would be the night club down the street which played loud bass pounding music on the weekends.
__label__0 The hotel is quite small for Waikiki and some rooms are a little dated ,because the hotel is being renovated,.
__label__0 Whilst the room was indeed large, clean and functional it lacked the finishing touches that one expects from 5-star accommodation.
__label__0 and it was OK.
__label__0 There was no smell in our room but we were told we could upgrade to a supperior for free.
__label__0 Ours was perfect.
__label__0 I was attracted to Hotel Fita by its location and offer of free internet and long-distance telephone.
__label__0 All in all, we had a great time.
__label__1 I would not recommend this hotel.
__label__0 They carried themselves with dignity and were appreciative of tips-while not acting as though they expected to be tipped.
__label__1 Do not expect a excellent view, but you cant get it all.
__label__0 very good after a long walking day in Berlin.
__label__0 You get what you pay for
__label__0 I stayed at the Moore for 11 nights whilst on a conference in Seattle.
__label__0 and the operator treated me like I was a homeless person begging for a room instead of a paying guest.
__label__0 I was still in bed!
__label__0 Thanks to all staff.
__label__0 We would have done better to eat at the Supreme buffet but we were always wet from the ocean/pool.
__label__0 Our room was delightful, the service was brilliant and the breakfast was superb.
__label__0 and well kept with a mini fridge in the room that I really like, but sadly no coffee maker.
__label__0 and their food recommendations in the immediate vicinity were right on the mark.
__label__0 But, it is LA and free parking isnt typical.
__label__0 The check-out from the room is just as easy as the check-in.
__label__0 About what you'd expect from a four star hotel.
__label__0 ,By the way,The same can be said for Sofitel Water Tower,
__label__0 Next time I'd stay at the more modern Ku'damm 101(owned by the same owners) or the Kempinski Bristol down the block.
__label__0 Worst part - Parking - you have to pay,
__label__0 and sixth floor unitl 3 am in the morning!!
__label__1 Just remember to GO EARLY.
__label__0 it is a very noisy hotel -- do NOT get a room in the upper 20s.
__label__0 All together we were a group of 8 on a 3 night stay in Berlin as part of a package starting from Thursday through to Sunday.
__label__0 The room was clean and fresh smelling.
__label__0 The hotel is right at downtown and 5 minutes to really good restaurants
__label__0 The concierge brought out a tourist map and in no time had gone through the attractions with us, along with how to navigate the metro.
__label__0 Will upload photos later.
__label__0 2 days went by where our room was not even cleaned at all, no new towels, nothing.
__label__0 Hot water seemed quite a scare commodity, if you washed mid-afternoon you were alright
__label__0 Everything was SO CLEAN and SO NEW and SO WELL DONE
__label__0 Went to Seattle for our Aniversary.
__label__0 As many people have commented poorly about this resort and others, you need to remember you are not at home, most of the people who live in these countries do not have large homes with 2 cars, a pool etc.
__label__0 We went to visit the hotel to find that it was a converted apartment block in a rather seedy part of a very busy road.
__label__0 The result was if you ate at the buffet, you had to wait for a table and stand in two lines to obtain your meal.
__label__0 shopping and sightseeing and of course at this time of year there are a few Christmas markets within walking distance.
__label__0 and the sliding wardrobe door seemed to be just about hanging on.
__label__0 and the server showed up just as I was leaving to attend a meeting.
__label__0 Well placed hotel
__label__1 As other reviewers have mentioned, however, street noise is a factor to be considered.
__label__0 We had a wonderful two week vacation at Riu Palace Macao.
__label__0 Great room with big bathroom.
__label__0 We then returned to the hotel for one more night before heading back home.
__label__0 All of it is absolutely gorgeous.
__label__0 The bartender, Michael, makes a great Manhattan
__label__0 Booked this hotel because of reviews in Trip Advisor.
__label__0 The tents at the end of the beach has nice gifts at good prices.
__label__0 Many nights no reservations were available, we were told, despite there being 5 couples seated in a 117-person-capacity restaurant--we booked dinner every evening the 1st night there.
__label__0 If I did, I would stay at the Millenium Plaza again
__label__0 We had booked a double bed.
__label__0 The trams though only serve the old East side.
__label__0 There is a lot of high tech inside the room but some is just too high tech and not useful and even dangerous.
__label__0 As soon as I arrived I went to wash my hands
__label__0 Located in a so so area of North Phoenix.
__label__0 First thing we noticed were the meticulously landscaped lawns and gardens.
__label__0 and there were no bath matts.
__label__0 but the parking is $27 a day for guests which we thought pricey.
__label__0 This was not what we had in mind for our Waikiki vacation.
__label__0 The rooms where spacious, everything was clean and the beds are really good.
__label__0 The concierge had no idea about the sites in the city, how to get there and espically how to get back.
__label__0 The decor was nice, different and a bit funky.
__label__0 Indeed one of the most consistent things with this hotel is its high prices for less than perfect drinks, food and service.
__label__0 My three children ages 9, 14, 16 and I stayed at the El Conquistador from Jan 20-25, 2007.
__label__0 If you're a walker, you are close to many attractions.
__label__0 There were hand rails everywhere and two showers so we figured we were in a handicap room.
__label__0 Breakfast is a buffet continental repast-- the room gets crowded but the food is quite fresh.
__label__0 The net curtains had not seen a washer in a long while.
__label__0 I declined to stay at one of their proerties because I wanted something different.
__label__0 Beautiful grounds.
__label__0 Charing Cross only 10 mins by train.
__label__0 and we had to cut our vacation short.
__label__0 Location is brilliant, right next to the bustling Clarke Quay with its many bars and restaurants.
__label__0 The front desk staff was great during the week
__label__0 I was upgraded to a two room suite.
__label__0 and they gave me a room upgrade to a renovated room.
__label__0 Close to the Leidsplien and other main streets.
__label__0 I am sure that our complaint is not the only one they will receive about the problems at the Gran Flamenco, Punta Cana as there were many unsatisfied guests there.
__label__0 Breakfast choice was great,
__label__0 It isn't that great of a location, and certainly not worth being treated as if I were pond scum because of using Hotwire (as if people who saved money were stupid).
__label__0 The buffet style restaurants, Caribeno and Toscano, are disappointing to say the least.
__label__0 Bathroom is average looking too, with mold smell.
__label__0 A t-shirt and a bottle just dont cut it when you spent so much to come and relax
__label__0 they organise private parties on the seventh floor of the hotel,
__label__0 Walter, Melvin and Maria did a great job of drawng the crowd into the activities.
__label__0 Walking distance to almost everything you'd want to see in the downtown area.
__label__0 It was the highlight of this trip.
__label__0 We turned the cushions over.
__label__0 great place for tourists
__label__0 Would stay here again.
__label__0 He was helpful in saying that he would make a note in his computer system for verification of reasons we couldnt stay, not sure if this actually occured but we will see.
__label__0 We went up to the rooms.
__label__0 easy check in with the front desk person taking us up to the room to explain everything.
__label__0 The worst part was, you didnt know what was going to be closed until the day it was closed.
__label__0 The hotel connected to a mall which was convenient as we ate breakfast there and had Starbucks there.
__label__0 Rooms were spacious, staff was nice...
__label__0 They knew my name when I got out of the cab, which was wild, and the intro/check in/walk through was very cool indeed
__label__0 but i was charged for valet parking which i'm in dispute with the Warwick about.
__label__0 Wonderful stay, wonderful staff
__label__0 just told where our room was
__label__0 I had to argue with the staff to take the meal off my bill.
__label__0 When we went in we immediatley noticed the smell.
__label__0 Sometimes in Manhattan the hotels lean to business class or carry the attitude that theres more where you came from, consequently you dont get that personal service.
__label__1 I would suggest anything in block 5 and up if you want less noise during those hours.
__label__1 So if you have trouble with stairs request a lower floor.
__label__0 I was pleasantly surprised that I was given a room with a king-size bed,
__label__0 At $114 for each of three summer weeknights, I was really satisfied with the Intercontinental.
__label__0 The rooms are clean with windows that open.
__label__0 Great value in Seattle
__label__0 It does get booked up on the weekends these days because of all the cruise ships leaving from Seattle.
__label__0 Added to that were the $10/day charge for internet, which I could have gotten for free at just about any coffee shop,
__label__0 There is no bellhop;
__label__0 and that some fees usually apply,
__label__0 The hotel sent a car to the airport for us and the car alerted the hotel we were coming.
__label__0 On arrival we were given a map and directions to les rambles, the receptionist also told us which streets close to the hotel to avoid.
__label__0 Though we were quite pleased with the room, it did show some wear... peeling paint, a few mold spots near the patio door, and more mold on a few of the cushions on the day bed.
__label__0 First, there were two uniformed associates outside, a doorman and a bellman.
__label__0 There are so many things right with this hotel, starting with the location ,right in the heart of mid-town, near the Empire State Bldg and Macys in a neighborhood filled with small markets, pubs ,restaurants AND right next to a subway stop, to the price, and of course the wonderful staff.
__label__0 The amenities are great.
__label__0 and we then were locked out of our room for a further forty minutes
__label__0 We went to Bannigans next door which is adequate for a supper and a beer.
__label__0 I went to the Moore with a few co-workers as a getaway to see Seattle's sights.
__label__0 The location is perfect and close to everything Boston has to offer.
__label__0 We chose the Laurel Inn because it takes pets and provides parking, but found that it has a lot more going for it.
__label__0 It was like sleeping on a board
__label__0 and it was "because it wasn't." I asked if this was acceptable service to them
__label__0 From 2PM until 4PM, I was told our room would be avaiable in 20 Minutes.
__label__0 I was informed by several associates and managers that the owners of the hotel , it is my understanding that Marriott owns the people but others own the building, refused to inform guests of the renovations.
__label__0 Stayed here for 3 nights in July 2004.
__label__0 I called, and spoke with Matthew Sims once again just to be laughed at and told to have a nice day.
__label__0 I was very happy with our stay here.
__label__0 Great price too
__label__1 Take rooms on side or rear.
__label__0 The hotel was extremely clean and well kept.
__label__0 We had a one bedroom suite on the fourth floor adjacent to the Golden Door Spa.
__label__0 Pool is a bit small but adequate, the gym well equipped but not used much.
__label__0 The last bus from the centre to the hotel leaves at 02:45am
__label__0 Beach: Not much to say here but lovely.
__label__0 The beach had numerous palm thatched cabanas.
__label__0 Our suite was decorated tastefully with Chagall prints and very comfortable.
__label__0 Staff neither gushing nor aloof.
__label__0 We went at 8:15 and it was very nice.
__label__0 We were surprised and disappointed at the condition of our room.
__label__0 you have to get on a bus which will take you to a station on the U-Bahn so we ended up catching a taxi to the hotel instead which came to about 25 Euro's which is cheaper than most taxi's to other European cities we have been to.
__label__0 My husband actually got up once, walked to the soda fountain, glasses in hand, and refilled our sodas... and the workers who saw him do that said nothing.
__label__0 The hop on hop off tour buses also stop nearby so for us the location was ideal.
__label__0 I booked this hotel through Hot Wire and called immediately requesting a nonsmoking room, a king bed and a room away from the elevator/ice.
__label__0 Fantastic Value on Waikiki
__label__0 First Class hotel
__label__0 We did have a BIG problem with a member of the night staff.
__label__0 I will never stay here again.
__label__0 There were robes (not very large, soft or fluffy) and slippers, small, thin towels (in fact my friends had to share a towel).
__label__1 My recommendation - spring for the extra money - the full ocean view is well worth it
__label__0 and I was told they would be,
__label__0 and people had taken to scratching profanities into it.
__label__0 Hotel Metro Never Fails
__label__0 Stayed for 6 nites , fortunate to be upgraded to Junior Suite, no isssues with room size ,standard rooms noted as small ?,.
__label__0 Every guest is treated with near-honor.
__label__0 This hotel is exceptional value for money.
__label__0 After we arrived, the bell men took our luggage into the hotel, and our car was parked for us.
__label__0 The every morning at 8:00 AM housekeeping would knock.
__label__0 All restrooms in Restaurants were nice and cleanIn all we paid for a 5***** Hotel and got 3*** Service.
__label__0 The room itself was ok
__label__0 found lovely tapas bars and ate with the locals.
__label__0 There are escalators from the main entrance up to the lobby and they are surrounded by lots of greenery and flowers.
__label__0 Essentially they took 3 rooms and knocked down the walls to make a suite.
__label__0 We were given a king bed in the old tower.
__label__0 The rooms were absolutely perfect.
__label__0 They do everything to help you enjoy your stay.
__label__0 but it was fairly modern,
__label__0 I think this was because of the spree river
__label__0 This was a refreshing change and something staff at the supposed super resorts in Dubai ,I have Madinat Jumeirah in Mind, should take note of.
__label__0 but I found this hotel quite bad.
__label__1 Also bring comfy shoes, ALOT of walking, take advantage of the golf carts to bring you to the other hotels at night.
__label__0 It seemed that we were a nuisance to most we came in contact with
__label__0 We were getting married in San Francisco and had heard great things about the PA.
__label__1 If you get there in the morning you can easily have 300 yds of sand to yourself.
__label__0 So, I will now have to dispute those charges since the connection was bad and I did not get access at all except for the first few mins it needed the credit card number.
__label__0 that it hardly matters where you stay in the city-
__label__0 The beds were extremely comfortable as is the trademark of the Heavenly beds.
__label__0 This surprised me since Ohana has some completely non smoking properties.
__label__0 But we were drawn to the design of the Art'otel.
__label__0 The Westin is really centrally located so I took off to find dinner and found a bunch of places within a block or two of the hotel.
__label__0 Im not saying this isnt a good hotel for the price and location, but I would look around before I would stay here again.
__label__0 The Hotel is less than 1/2 block from the closest U Bhan station - but is situated in a quiet street.
__label__0 As I said, its not exactly a tourist hotel but then again Singapore isnt exactly the most thrilling place on earth either.
__label__0 Most importantly the staff were very friendly and polite and the concierge cant do enough for you.
__label__0 but I don't have experience them.
__label__0 He seemed harried and annoyed at me asking too many questions.
__label__0 Tiergarten is great for a leisurely wander in the evening.
__label__0 The rooms are very nice and the beds very comfortable.
__label__0 Now, if you are one of the luckies that has an extra $40 per night to spend....don't hesitate.
__label__0 I arrived about 10 am and was told my room wasn't ready.
__label__0 A taxi will cost about 10 euros.
__label__0 I could have done without this meal.
__label__0 and also in the other bedrooms of the hotel where fellow Portuguese travelers stayed.
__label__0 However, exceedingly frustrating was that the alla carte restaurants were never more than 35 percent full, that we saw, during any dinner time.
__label__0 It was in the middle of the tourist section.
__label__0 Lovely park nearby too.
__label__0 The staff in my view is one of the best group of hotel employees in the world.
__label__0 I paid $53 per night for the Monarch, it was worth all of $20.
__label__0 The horseback riding which is included is a joke..
__label__0 The location is very close to the train station ,easily walkable,, the San Lorenzo market is a block away and everything else is easily walkable.
__label__0 Enjoyed a great local package deal with the hotel (check out their local website first for rates).
__label__0 We have been to Sandals Jamaica, Cuba and Cancun and this is by far the best we have visited.
__label__0 and we were able to walk to places,
__label__0 The water pressure was horrible and the jets did not work.
__label__0 We just got back from teh Royal Sonesta.
__label__0 Who knows when it was last washed...
__label__0 On the good side, it was in a great location, and I never felt unsafe.
__label__0 Entering the room we had to discover - it was a smoking room.
__label__0 Excellent restaurants within walking distance the Metreon for movies.
__label__0 When I pointed out the mistake, he returned with sausage, then disappeared.
__label__0 We still cant believe we stayed at such a beautiful place with such great service for the amount of money we paid.
__label__0 They are quick with a hello and the hugs are a plenty.
__label__0 However, they overbooked the property when I got there and would only accomodate me in a smoking environment.
__label__0 Probably the most enjoyable aspect of both our stays was the staff.
__label__0 The onsite restuarant was also excellent - supported by good advice on local eating establishments when we wanted to venture out.
__label__0 After a long day we opted for room service in the evening which was very good.
__label__0 We were moved to a slightly better double room (two beds purshed together) but still in the old part of the hotel.
__label__0 That way you avoid the queues and walk right in like an expected guest- free tour excellent.
__label__0 This is the second time that we are staying at Lanson Place, Hong Kong.
__label__0 We were a bit annoyed because the location of the hotel had been our primary reason for booking.
__label__0 The CPI is in walking distance to all of Condado as well as on the bus route for taking a trip to Old San Juan or to Isle de Verde.
__label__0 The young fellow at front desk was a pleasure to talk with.
__label__0 Small hotel near the Ala Moana marina and shopping centre.
__label__0 This is a FABULOUS hotel.
__label__0 A Fine Establishment
__label__0 The location was just perfect, very close to Victoria Station in a very nice and quiet neighbourhood.
__label__0 If they are working on improving customer service , as previous reviews have stated, they have a ways to go.
__label__0 Yes, we liked it,too.
__label__0 The front desk staff was nice.
__label__0 The lobby was a little small and got crowded one monrning whena larger group of people arrived.
__label__0 and the 100  200 buses stop there.
__label__0 The room was equiped with ONE small bottle of water and ONE robe and this continued each day.
__label__0 a construction crew convened.
__label__0 I highly recommend Hotel Metro and will likely stay there next time I visit wonderful New York City.
__label__0 The evening beer, wine and soda coupled with veggies and snacks was really nice and the breakfast in the morning was worth its weight in gold
__label__0 I have no problem with renovations.
__label__0 Had booked this hotel for a 10-night stay ,got a great deal via
__label__0 I only regret that I didn't wear my new Trip adviser bill hat!
__label__0 We recently spent 12/9-16 in this resort and if there is a down side to it the only complaint would be that our ceiling fan broke on day 2 and apparently replacement units are hard to come by in the Dominican Republic and so we lived without it for the duration, not in surmountable.
__label__1 If you want out of the hustle more modern surroundings, this is your place.
__label__0 Attractive decor.
__label__0 The hotel had fun modern decor, and the staff were very friendly, intelligent, helpful, and uniformly young ,nearly all under 40 years,.
__label__0 two people need to take turns walking around the room.
__label__0 but I could see the shuttle bus driver was not impressed by my hotel of choice.
__label__0 but in a 5* hotel I expected one to be there.
__label__0 In the mornings, there is a complimentary continental breakfast set up in te lobby.
__label__0 We were on the 7th floor so noise was not a problem.
__label__0 What do you do with two rooms when you're alone?
__label__0 I will definitely return to The Toren on a future trip--just with my husband this time
__label__0 I stayed at the RIU the last time I visited Miami.
__label__1 I felt relaxed and comfortable there--I recommend it.
__label__0 Staff were top-notch, and quality of service second to nothing.
__label__0 Great, clean rooms and bathrooms.
__label__0 Don't get me wrong.
__label__0 It was so much fun and there are plenty of bars around the park to go to before and after , Game On and Cask n Flagon were our favorites.
__label__0 We would have to drive there or they could call us a cab.
__label__0 We will never book this hotel again!
__label__0 We ate in the attached bar Red Fin, and the food and wine were very tasty.
__label__0 but next time would stay somewhere less expensive.
__label__0 and then have to step over debris and rolled up carpets to find the room.
__label__0 Every night, and I mean every single night of our stay, a minimum of four of the listed restaurants were closed, and two were actually just one place named twice.
__label__0 Staff is excellent.
__label__0 and the location was perfect.
__label__0 The rooms were beautiful, not large, but definitely enough room for two.
__label__0 but that negative first impression still lingers.
__label__0 We liked the Japenese and the Steakhouse the best.
__label__0 2 facts we didn___t like.
__label__0 Fantastic Fantastic hotel.
__label__0 A bit pricey for a can of Sprite.
__label__0 However, I strain to compare this boutique hotel to the others I have visited on the west coast.
__label__1 You can park your car yourself and save money doing without valet service.
__label__0 Everything else in the room was fine.
__label__0 Great place to stay
__label__0 Excellent hotel, superb staff.
__label__0 ,In fact, upon my return home I started to redecorate my house because I enjoyed the minimalist aspect of the decor at BP.,
__label__0 toilet had been used but not flushed...
__label__0 It was not too heavy in my room since I aksed for non-smoking one.
__label__0 And tipping made no difference ,we would NEVER consider not tipping,.
__label__0 Thankyou for the opportunity to review and we hope this message will help you do what is necessary to avoid anymore of the same.
__label__0 Only one almost useless pillow per person though (think no thicker than a cracker) and no availability of additional bed linen as most other hotels would normally provide.
__label__0 The one bar round the corner had one old pensioner propping the bar up on a Friday evening.
__label__0 This is one of the nicest hotels in the Dallas/Ft.
__label__0 Thanks to Del ,valet area, and Kieth ,front desk, we were taken care of.
__label__0 Fast food restaurants are opposite the Gedaechtnis Kirche if you are absolutely desperare for cheap fare late at night.
__label__0 The carpet from the 1970's has blue bows on it and looks like something from your grandmother's house.
__label__0 Our only complaint - and this is a really odd one - is that our room smelled of what we could only describe as cabbage.
__label__0 and we had looked forward to a high level of service due to the fact that we work for a 5-star hotel ourselves.
__label__0 so it was wonderful for just drive up, have valet take car, bel-hop grab bags and be in room, with bags, in less than five minutes.
__label__0 Right across from the International Market Place and close to any shop or bus stop or anything you wanted.
__label__0 I had a deluxe king room on the 7th floor.
__label__0 The hallways smelled a little funky, but tolerable.
__label__1 The rooms can be a bit small but I suggest ocean view only since the other rooms face high rises and this defeats the purpose of being in a tropical setting.
__label__1 Dont let the price fool you- its better to spend a few extra bucks for cleanliness, a walkable neighborhood without someone asking you for money or cigarettes or whatever they may be looking for.
__label__0 Liked the room, and the location, but didn't care for the staff of the hotel.
__label__0 the staff are friendly and helpful,
__label__0 They have nice meeting room space, and the rooms are reasonably priced.
__label__0 Next time I visit NYC I will definitley be staying here again.
__label__0 We were told to go,
__label__0 Good service overall.
__label__0 Among the best, for sure
__label__0 The service from the staff is more than excellent.
__label__0 For the length of stay, I would have appreciated the hotel to have offered the best rate, and been able to amend when we arrived.
__label__0 It was extremely humid so I imagine its quite difficult for things to dry properly there... hence the mold.
__label__0 So far the riviera maya in mexico has the most beautiful water that ive been too.
__label__0 The water pressure was low, the bed was average, the decor was spartan, and the bathroom was quite small.
__label__0 Room service breakfast was very good.
__label__0 NOT A NEW ROOM, NOT A SUITE, NOT A TOP FLOOR...but breakfast.
__label__0 Knowing the area, I knew I wasnt going to have too much of an ocean view.
__label__0 The room price was actually pretty reasonable.
__label__0 Location is perfect neww the cable cars.
__label__0 One of the smallest rooms in any Best Western I have stayed in.
__label__0 The pool is amazingly HUGE.
__label__0 The trip was definately worthwhile.
__label__0 however you can still enjoy stunning views of the aquarium.
__label__0 I have searched for the design,
__label__0 The staff are very attentive and the service was very good.
__label__0 but most bathrooms are in urgent need of remodelling (the existing ones are dating back to the 60s!).
__label__0 It was hard to believe that you were only a couple of hundred yards away from the Grand Canal, you heard nothing, not even the church bells
__label__0 There were 21 restaurant and 22 stores right on site.
__label__0 10 minute walk to museum where the david is, 10 minute walk to duomo, 20 minute walk to uffizi and most other nice parts.
__label__0 Loads of choice and well presented.
__label__0 A few minor down sides were tin roof ,we had 3rd floor room and heavy rains were LOUD,, roosters making noise quite often ,yes, even in middle of night,, and rental charges for everything ,bikes, towels, chairs, etc.,
__label__0 The pool was average at best.
__label__0 Pleased with stay
__label__0 The gym has exceptional equiptment .
__label__0 The best meal I had was at the Seattle Tap Room in the airport.
__label__0 bed was good.
__label__0 The check-in is amazingly quick and can be done without talking to anyone, if you choose.
__label__0 The location was terrific.
__label__0 No amenities at all...
__label__0 Breakfast rooms were inside or outside: cereal; scrambled eggs, bacon, cheese, ham, breads, pastries, yogurt, fruit, jams, bottled water and good coffee.
__label__0 I am not in any way saying dont go, it is a very beautiful country, most people are nice, but, there is not a lot of places to go like in Mexico, where you can take a bus and you are at the shopping mall in 10 min.
__label__0 The RDL was literally a block away, we could be there in about 5 mins.
__label__0 Instead of duvet there a blanket placed between two sheets, swimming pool is very very small but also very very dirty,
__label__0 The reception staff and cleaners were really friendly and helpful, all spoke excellent English which was helpful as our Catalan was pitiful.
__label__0 I would stay here again.
__label__1 If you go over by the to the left of the resort by the shops there is less sea weed.
__label__0 and the room itself was quite comfortable--but very small.
__label__0 The lobby bar was a bit slow in the evening unless you asked for rum and coke, pina colada or beer.
__label__1 The beer is okay when cold ,dont forget the bubba keg, and there is always a very happy and gracious bartender to get you whatever you want.
__label__0 The pool is indoors upstairs and has a strong chlorine smell that wafts to the fancy ballroom.
__label__0 The staff was amazingly helpful, the restaurants were some of the best Ive ever been to in my life ANYWHERE
__label__0 The crepes were my favourite part of breakfast.
__label__0 We also received champagne and chocolates our first night.
__label__0 Great location, rooms questionable
__label__0 though so the room smelled fine.
__label__0 I wouldn't pay that, but try to get a rate that includes breakfast!
__label__0 The rooms were clean
__label__0 I would trade the breakfast off for the location which again is excellent.
__label__0 Breakfast was not included
__label__0 The other thing is that the inroom wifi is outrageously priced at EUR9 for 2 hours.
__label__0 but never before have I been offered a dirty, smelly room and then upcharged for a "renovated" (i.e. clean) room.
__label__0 Our room was on the 26th floor with a view of the empire state building from the bed
__label__0 It is a three star hotel.
__label__0 Where was Management?
__label__0 Beds comfy, room spotless, good sanitary appliances as opposed to usual British plumbing
__label__0 but the area around the bath had mold growing on it.
__label__0 Paradisus severely lacking.
__label__0 a very important point since the street in front of the hotel is heavily trafficked at most times.
__label__0 Though, we are fully aware that european hotels are less in quality compared with the ones in Asia or US.
__label__0 handy hotel for metro.
__label__0 The room was equipped with a security box in the wardrobe and a very efficient mini bar, not to mention the wall mounted flat screen TV.The bathroom was spotlessly clean, and equipped with a superb shower cubicle.
__label__1 Suggestions: Woodland Park Zoo (fantastic and worth the 10 minute bus drive out of downtown); Anthony's Pier 66 (excellent seafood restaurant on the waterfront) Enjoy your stay at the Moore!
__label__0 Same exact food if you are at the cafe, room service or catering a banquet.
__label__0 We are regular guests at various Embassy Suites and Hilton products.
__label__0 The best service of the whole stay was from the bell-man.
__label__1 5h on  a platform to look down  Really: NOT TO DO - the bar in the Moore: rough.
__label__0 One of, if not the best place Ive ever stayed at
__label__0 Tipping - We tipped the maids $2 each day, $2 at the a la carte restaurants, and $2 per bag to the bell boys as they dragged our suitcases up 4 floors when we first got there.
__label__0 We've been calling the hotel nightly and every employee we speak to is unable to fix the problem;
__label__0 and it had a very strong, musty odour (mould perhaps?) At the front desk we were told that because they were fully booked, they could only offer us another room in the same grade, or a "renovated" room for an extra 30 Euros per night.
__label__0 I had booked a quiet singleroom with a bathtub, however, when I arrived they said I will receive the familyroom, for unknown reasons.
__label__0 I booked about a month in advance on their website.
__label__0 The location (awesome) and the breakfast (awesome) raised this hotels grade to average to me.
__label__0 So a very nice hotel, albeit not a great value.
__label__0 The bathroom was quite small but it was nice and clean.
__label__0 Rooms are spacious, clean and elegant.
__label__0 My husband and I stayed at the Westin for three nights.
__label__0 and the two hotels are very similar in terms of service and room standards,
__label__0 The location was great.
__label__0 In conclusion, this is no *****star hotel.
__label__0 Colleagues ask me why when I can stay at one of the massive chain hotels, also on the approved list.
__label__0 Very disappointing experience there!
__label__0 and furnishings are well thought out.
__label__0 Granted, as you enter the lobby you feel that you are entering into a great hotel.
__label__0 but that just seemed like a mission since we only had one full day in Seattle at the tail end of this trip.
__label__0 We requested the renovated Union St Tower and were really happy with the room - decent downtown view, new furnishings, very comfortable and contemporary.
__label__0 Found the staff helpful and the taxi drivers knew where the hotel was, so no trouble finding it.
__label__0 The hotel is close to several subways on different routes.
__label__0 Worth a taxi sometimes...
__label__0 Those are things that are important to me.
__label__0 ,These people work twelve hour days, dont get paid over-time and only get paid about $200 USD A MONTH,.
__label__0 My friends and I ,3 young women, stayed at this hotel at the beginning of August.
__label__0 Wont stay here again
__label__0 We asked for another room, no answer.
__label__0 Just enough to start the day
__label__0 For what we paid for those rooms, they should have been courteous enough not to ream us on parking.
__label__0 We had a very large room with two queen beds and a large ,and comfortable, sofa bed.
__label__1 If you are looking for a fancy, corporate Marriot or Sheraton, this is not the place for you.
__label__0 Reception staff were first class, concierge service was equally as gracious with an ambundance of local knowledge from advice as to where to get a good pint to the best place for toys, complete with a beware the quality reminder.
__label__0 No frills - nice mini bar in room but VERY expensive.
__label__0 The Centre is safe because it's either packed with cars during the day or closed at night.
__label__0 Fantastic Hotel.
__label__0 embassy which sells pizza and 2 huge litre glasses of beer for 15 euro.
__label__1 Do beware that a soda at the bar will cost you $3.56 before tip
__label__0 I really enjoyed my stay here,
__label__0 I selected the Toren based on its location and the previous reviews.
__label__0 I will not be returning.
__label__0 What a transformation
__label__0 This is not exactly a tourist hotel but it is clean and comfortable.
__label__0 The breakfast includes fresh island fruits, juices, coffee/tea, pastries, yogurt, and hard boiled eggs.
__label__0 My main gripe is that when you are paying $300 a night for a room you would expect to have free internet in your room.
__label__0 recommended by a friend
__label__0 The room was massive, and the bathroom was incredible
__label__0 Why we were glad that we found this hotel was the fact that we were looking for a retreat that we could come back to after a busy day of exploring the more bustling areas of the city.
__label__0 Breakfast was always busy.
__label__0 The room was very clean.
__label__0 The lobby also has a nice lounge area with a fireplace.
__label__0 and the free internet with printer on the mezzanine.
__label__0 I selected a 4 star in downtown Seattle on priceline for $99. The reservation was accurate
__label__1 The location is okay for but for better restaurants and sight-seeing, stay closer to Postdamer Platz or Mitte.
__label__0 I first stayed at the Hotel Metro about 8 years ago and over the years have returned when visiting NY either for business or pleasure.
__label__0 Booked online via the official website for a Superior room.
__label__0 Had difficulty locking the door to one room,
__label__0 I asked for the sheets to be changed three times
__label__0 Tea bags were provided in the room.
__label__0 A great choice!!
__label__0 I spent 11 nights in the Wyndham Boston, and found it to be an excellent hotel.
__label__0 The hotel had responded that, that wouldn't be a problem.
__label__0 Even going down the metro escalator steps at a good clip with my husband behind me, someone slipped in between us and opened my backpack.
__label__0 We stayed at The Benjamin from Feb 18-24.
__label__0 All our previous selections had been a great sucess,
__label__0 and you waded around in the shower water even with the poor water flow from the shower.
__label__0 Made you practically run to and from the elevator to get away from it as fast as possible.
__label__0 We were unable to stop at the hotel before the game.
__label__0 Just returned from a 3 night stay.
__label__0 The room was great, huge bed, lovely terrace overlooking the Gran Via, huge tv and lovely bathroom.
__label__0 Easy.
__label__0 A twin bedded room, and I mean twin and small beds.
__label__0 We complained to management three times
__label__0 When I asked the clerk at the front desk, he said that the hotel was under construction
__label__0 however upon arrival the reservation was no where to be found.
__label__0 OK, the first night, everything was seafood which I dont eat.
__label__0 People are more friendly and helpful than in Cancun.
__label__0 Even after I read this hotels excellent reviews, it still exceeded my expectations.
__label__0 This review is real, and our experiences not exaggerated.
__label__0 This resort you know your eating beef.
__label__0 As I read in recent reviews there is difinitely a lang barrier if you do not speak spanish, but there is always someone around that does speak english.
__label__0 and it was very cold.
__label__0 For $200 I would like a turn down and chocolate, decent room service and not have to spend a fortune on the phone or internet acess.
__label__0 We had reserved a non-smoking room
__label__0 The hotel was build in the Eastern Germany Days, but its renovated in most parts.
__label__0 4* NH Central Station
__label__0 It was a sportsbar type place
__label__0 Overall the hotel is quite ok,
__label__0 Ill definitely be back.
__label__0 likely because we were drunk when we went to bed so we didn't notice anything.
__label__0 I will definitely stay that this hotel on our next trip to Amsterdam.
__label__0 Restaurants - food great and a nice selection.
__label__0 The rooms were great
__label__1 Drinks: Unless you like really sweet drinks, you might want to consider bringing your own mixers..
__label__0 Great location, perfectly nice hotel
__label__1 and we had a balcony and a great view of the Space Needle (I'd recommend asking for a space needle view, if you book).
__label__0 The room was at the back of the hotel and overlooked an overgrown garden with a block of flats looking directly onto the rooms.
__label__0 Two very dissapointed world traveller.
__label__0 Though, there are a significant number of places to eat within walking distance.
__label__0 We stayed in the economy size room which was VERY small but I knew to expect that as the hotel makes that clear.
__label__0 There were also plenty of restaurants and pubs nearby.
__label__0 Room was excellent, we requested to be close to the beach so we were abit far away from everything else.
__label__0 After many years it was wonderful to come back to Boston.
__label__0 The concierge was very informative and the front staff very polite.
__label__0 Reception was full of flowers, and an enduring memory of the hotel will be the scent of lilies, gorgeous
__label__0 They also have a nice pool and spa
__label__0 Some good, some bad
__label__0 There were three of us travelling together, my parents ,who were making their first trip to NYC, and me.
__label__0 Late review for Berlin Markt.
__label__0 A great value in a prime location
__label__0 However, the worst thing was the level of service (or rather the complete lack of it).
__label__0 The beds were extremely comfortable, and the rooms surprisingly quiet.
__label__0 Our pillowcases were stained,
__label__0 2004 2005.
__label__0 I finally got the attention of a young gentleman ,Alex, to see the obvious which is just to find me a comparable room with their other properties.
__label__0 but the covers only just fit the width of the single beds
__label__0 First and formost this hotel is a nice property, how ever the rooms are not at all as they tell on the website.
__label__0 Now if they could only move the hotel 15km to the northeast....
__label__0 If we knew that then we would of been happy to have a room in the old tower.
__label__0 Parking at $28 was obscene and the $1.50 for 6 oz.
__label__0 The rooms are recently renovated, and much improved.
__label__0 I stay here every business trip to Sydney
__label__0 At 10:00 p.m. the fax was slipped under my door.
__label__0 The lobby and cocktail bar were a lovely touch and very relaxing.
__label__0 The place has a lot of potential, so I think that once they actually start renovating the rooms it will be a great place.
__label__0 After finding a concierge who knew where Fishermans Terminal was she advised taking a cab, which we did.
__label__0 The rest of Barcelona is really out of reach on foot.
__label__0 the beds were improperly made,
__label__0 Hotel is beautiful but rooms are a little outdated.
__label__0 Or just buy better earplugs than I had :,
__label__0 Another pair of chocolates lay on the pillow.
__label__0 This hotel was recommended by friends and we are very greatfull they told us about the hotel Aalders.
__label__0 We paid a wedding rate so I am not sure how it fares from a value proposition.
__label__0 The room was a bit smaller than the typical hotel room, but it was clean and looked well kept.
__label__0 The rooms were average European size and the bathroom was very modern with plenty of hot water.
__label__0 There is no gift/sundry shop due to the construction
__label__0 Huge bathroom and bed plus work desk and internet connection.
__label__0 Nice boutique hotel in a fabulous city
__label__0 we stayed at this hotel for a week.
__label__0 One evening, dinner took 3.5 hours after arrival.
__label__0 We travel on a budget and were lucky to get 2 nights at a discount rate
__label__0 The hotels there could have been anywhere in the world, only the fact that the word Bali appeared on signs gave you any hint as to where you were.
__label__0 You do get towels, sheets and soap, but that's it.
__label__0 I needed to print something,
__label__0 And, finally, on weekdays between 5 and 8 p.m. they serve complimentary wine and cheese accompanied by piano music.
__label__0 The lobby isn't very impressive, and we were a bit worried as we headed up to our room,
__label__0 Cocktail, maybe some fruit or the best guacamole you ever had.
__label__0 Location.... perfect; staff.... warm, welcoming and professional; room... perfectly appointed; food... sublime.
__label__0 Even Portobello - which is in the direct opposite of London - only took less than _?��_��__��_��___ hour by tube.
__label__0 We think not,a first class hotel set in a tropical paradise of luxuious gardens, white sand beaches and swaying palms filled with coconuts
__label__0 The a la carte restaurants: You make reservations at the front podium in the main buffet area.
__label__0 What time are they getting up???
__label__0 Arrived pretty late for our 4 night stay, because of flight delay.
__label__0 as are the rooms.
__label__0 when we arrived we were greeted by the front staff who helped us to bring our luggages up to the lobby.
__label__0 id defo say a good hotel for the money,
__label__0 Overall, I'd stay somewhere else on my next trip.
__label__0 I was a late arrival to hotel.
__label__0 room was attractive, clean, adequate size and very quiet even though faced on La rambla. restaurant was convenient and good for all meals though lots of small restaurants in area provideding easy access for meals.
__label__0 The food is just part of the deal and it has to be expected to be a bit lower quality compared to cruise ships.
__label__0 Again, the bathroom was small and the toiletries provided were average at best.
__label__0 I have stayed here several times for business over the last couple of years.
__label__0 We ate there during most of our stay.
__label__0 During our stay, despite many requests we were never able to persuade the staff to put a sailboat in the water.
__label__0 This hotel is on a main street, walking distance to Hollywood Blvd and in a safer part of Hollywood than many other hotels.
__label__0 The hotel is an easy walk to downtown shopping areas and Seattle Center attractions.
__label__0 When I arrived in Amsterdam, I went to the hotel and was told that they had no reservation for me, were not expecting me, and that they were full for the night.
__label__0 Decided on the Moore Hotel,downtown as I'm both thrifty and poor and on reading previous reviews, seemed to suit my budget.
__label__0 Resort was 98% full, which explains a lot.
__label__1 If you think you are going to a American/Canadian 4-5 star resort you would be fooling yourself.
__label__0 Perfect hotel at a perfect location
__label__0 Room service is very quick,
__label__0 The staff was the best.
__label__0 First night there was no top sheet on the bed only a thin comforter.
__label__0 Additionally, room service for a pot of coffee took 1 hour.
__label__0 I went back and forth between the Giraffe and The Muse, finally deciding on Giraffe just a few days before my trip.
__label__0 The bathroom also had a paper towel dispenser like in a public restroom and strange pink goo in the soap dispenser, which looked like it hadn't been changed since the track lighting was installed.
__label__0 On a positive note, the bed was very comfortable
__label__0 We arrived at the car part (mid term 5 mins from Terminal) at 12 midnight.
__label__0 Bed linen was for a queen size bed.
__label__0 But the rest of the hotel, forget about it.
__label__0 The location was also very accessible both on foot and trains to many Berlin Attractions in the centre of Berlin.
__label__0 It was not newly refurbished by any means.
__label__0 1. At first we got an unrenovated room.
__label__0 We paid just ���149.
__label__0 A buck goes a very long way.
__label__0 We got one of the suites on the 4th floor,
__label__0 For the elderly or overweight it is a task to get in and out of speed boat.
__label__0 I had very high expectations from what I had read about the resort in the Internet.
__label__0 The parking was great.
__label__0 but the luxurious touches I would have expected from a hotel of this standard were in my opinion poor.
__label__0 It was nice to finally eat at a restaurant that wasnt buffet.
__label__0 When we were shown to our room we were given a twin bedded room in the old part of the hotel.
__label__1 The only warning I have to offer is if you want to sleep past 8 AM, make sure you hang the do not disturb sign on your door.
__label__0 There is no way I could stay beyond 1 week at the Majestic as the food choices were getting quite boring and routine after a few days.
__label__0 It is 20 minutes walk to the hotel from there or 5 minutes by cab.
__label__0 We walked to the Sagrada , the Ramblas and beach from the hotel and we also used the metro.
__label__0 but the Dahlia Lounge directly opposite is fantastic.
__label__0 That means certain areas had not been cleaned in over 6 days...AVOID THIS RESORT.
__label__0 The rooms are very dark
__label__0 We also tried the Portage Cafe down at the Watertowns sister hotel, University Inn, and while the atmosphere was pretty cool, the service was horrible ,waitress was rude and apparently at the end of her shift, and the menu was mostly organic/health food so it was different from what we are used to.
__label__0 and they just changed the sheets once
__label__0 We live in a Seattle suburb and wanted to stay downtown for a wedding.
__label__0 We decided to book an extra night online and arrive on a Wednesday.
__label__0 We felt very welcome and comfortable right from the beginning.
__label__0 Oh well, A side note about the elevators.
__label__0 The cuts of meat are different and they try very hard to have something for everyone.
__label__1 But if you prefer to stay in a cozy and comfortable bed and breakfast type of hotel, the Avenue Garden is the perfect fit.
__label__0 Well so much good had been said about this hotel I knew we would be happy staying here.
__label__0 Included breakfast was wonderful.
__label__0 Excellent bedding and appointments really set this place apart from other rooms in this town.
__label__0 We had a direct view over the zoo and to the Fernsehturm.
__label__0 We asked for robes
__label__0 The hotel is well located and well priced.
__label__0 Something else I laughed off... they just brought me another plate of sushi.
__label__0 and this was by far the noisiest.
__label__0 This hotel is in two parts the new and the old.
__label__0 You had to pick and chose.
__label__0 My bf tried the tub, which he very much enjoyed.
__label__0 and the bed took up the majority of the room.
__label__0 Also all doors seem to have to slam to close.
__label__0 However, it is noisy.
__label__0 For great morning coffee and pastries try La Bergamote on 9th Ave at 20th.
__label__0 I know how to Assembly a computer and write web page , but I dont know how to get hot water safely.
__label__0 and the front desk kept a good eye on their lobby and the comings and goings of their patrons.
__label__0 Wild Ginger, McCormick and Schmicks, Top pot donuts, and skating along the sound helped to make it a great working vacation.
__label__0 The hotel is really modern but has an old school charm, for example dark oak walls and marble floored bathroom.
__label__0 Pleasantly surprised
__label__0 They were no help to us at all.
__label__0 There was an unexplained,
__label__0 We stayed at The Westin Grand Hotel
__label__0 Also, anyone bothered by a really hard mattress would not enjoy this hotel.
__label__1 If you want Wolfgang Puck, you should stay home to get it.
__label__0 We were charged city taxes of 5.66 euros per night per room.
__label__0 Sadly the hotel advertisements give the impression the aquarium is part of the hotel,
__label__0 The Supreme buffet is pretty good for breakfast, but many items are cold.
__label__1 Brazilian - I would recommend this.
__label__0 With Identity theft on the rise - I told them I didn't have a problem showing ID - but I wasn't going to let them write my Drivers License down.
__label__0 very inflamed bites which resulted me seeking medical advice about ( not from anyone at the hotel though, I hasten to add!!) Because of the mozzie problem, we ended up having to go through the night with the window shut in a room where the temp was 75 degrees(thermometer in room) so woke up with headaches, sweaty and feeling generally yuk!!
__label__1 Breakfast was quite pricey at 18euros each, but it was a buffet you could eat as much as you like, so if you have a big appetite, perhaps its good value, and if you didnt want to pay 18euros then dont eat it...
__label__0 A couple who ordered food after us were given complimentary drinks because of the wait, but we werent.
__label__0 Resort does not take care of its beach though.
__label__0 Stayed for one night at Casa Alta to do a bio tour.
__label__0 Dolce Vita Italian Restaurant - some of the dishes were good.
__label__0 The hotel had two positives: the concierge service and the location.
__label__0 For NYC, this was truly an exceptional touch to our stay.
__label__0 My husband and I stayed at the Park Hotel and enjoyed our time in Amsterdam.
__label__0 the lobby is outrageously crowded and bustling with groups.
__label__0 We asked at guest services for recomendations for children friendly restaurants
__label__0 However, I was told that many of the hotel rooms are very small, I dont know if this is true.
__label__0 Add me to the list of those who love this hotel
__label__0 Not exactly my idea of exclusive service and definitely not mentioned during booking or in the brochure.
__label__0 The other bad reviews must have gotten older rooms before they were renovated.
__label__0 We had a room facing Magazine street which had 18ft ceilings and windows to match - beautiful.
__label__0 Some of the resturant staff rude and obnoxious.
__label__0 When we checked into our room we received the most wonderful platter of fruits, nuts and banana bread and a fantastic display of fresh flowers.
__label__0 Beside the location the best thing is the atrium lobby ... very old fashioned, but a great spot My favorite hotel in Berlin
__label__0 The staff was very friendly and always willing to help with any questions.
__label__0 The shower sliding door is barely big enough for a normal sized person to get through.
__label__0 I gave him an earful and the next thing I know we were upgraded to the Penthouse suite.
__label__0 The rooms were clean and well maintained.
__label__0 Excellent location.
__label__0 and what I am receiving.
__label__0 We called and a sheet was dropped off for us to make our bed, as there was no housekeeping staff available.
__label__0 it was a credit card driven system charging 1Euro for 3 minutes online time and extra for every printed page.
__label__0 And the ridiculously overpriced spa where she had a number of treatments, all preceded by the ringing of a small bell.
__label__0 My room was on the top floor and the ceiling leaked badly.
__label__0 When I made the reservations, I told the hotel that we would have a late arrival but please save a room on the higher floors with a view for us, as we would be there 2 nights.
__label__0 and still had traces of what used to shield the balcony along the side so could be quite dangerous as these are very sharp.
__label__0 and then it was served cold.
__label__0 I think is the month the lady at the front desk said.
__label__0 I made a reservation to stay here in August 2007 and just got charged for the night I canceled.
__label__0 This hotel aint cheap, but it is in the middle of a very touristy area.
__label__0 If 8-10 people were in there, forget about working out.
__label__0 I beleive they charge 24Euros for it if it is not included.
__label__0 The service at the Alexandra Hotel was rude and slow especially on reception.
__label__0 There are some amazing , and not touristy , restaurants a short cab ride away on Kapahulu Ave. that offer a variety of reasonable ethnic cuisine.
__label__1 If you want to have the most relaxing and wonderful vacation ever come to Secrets
__label__0 If thats your thing, youll love it.
__label__0 Its location made up for its weaknesses,
__label__0 We did not use the pool or jacuzzi.
__label__0 Staff are exceptionally helpful and courteous.
__label__0 They met alot of people there.
__label__0 This hotel truly exceeded my high expections given the reviews on here.
__label__1 I was happy to get it, but a working minibar would have been preferable.
__label__0 I thought I should share my experiences with readers on this site.
__label__0 We were able to bike all the way to Blue Beach but it took an hour and was difficult since bikes were stuck in low gear.
__label__1 But for a true represenation, go to the five star alliance website.
__label__0 I called a number of times
__label__0 and all of it felt very outdated.
__label__0 One of the great things about this hotel and any great hotel, is the staff.
__label__0 Rooms were clean and comfortable.
__label__0 The time was well invested
__label__0 Staff were always pleasant and helpful.
__label__0 However, when we got there,
__label__0 The courtesy bus was excellent and always available. A great hotel
__label__0 it seemed a bit like that to me.
__label__0 Certainly coming again.
__label__0 I otherwise probably would not have been able to stay there for four nights ,it isnt cheap,, but with work paying for it, I got to splurge a little.
__label__0 A few things made my experience here good but not great.
__label__1 If you do end up here, be sure to specify a room at the back of the hotel.
__label__0 The reservation system allowed only you to reserve for the current day or the day following.
__label__0 Plenty of TV channels in many languages.
__label__0 breakfast consisted of bread, 3 different cold cuts and juices so you better be early at the breakfast table otherwise they do not re-stock.
__label__1 You can also use the MTR which is 4 mins from the hotel.
__label__0 My husband and I work for a luxury hotel company so,
__label__0 Bar prices very good.
__label__0 The hotel is immediately adjacent to the airport and it is perfect for early morning departures
__label__0 The hotel was not much of an improvement.
__label__0 We enjoyed our stay last week at the Magic Castle.
__label__0 The second day, I was unable to take a shower because the water was either very hot or cold.
__label__1 I really advice the hotel
__label__0 It was nicely done, but not Balinese at all, and we felt a little bit stark.
__label__0 Lack of service and nightlife
__label__0 There is much better out there.
__label__0 Stayed at the Nikko for 3 nights to attend a conference.
__label__0 When we checked out the next day she yelled from the front office window at us, while we are on the street.... that she was charging us for extra people....and they did
__label__0 The rooms were clean and comfortable and good sized.
__label__0 Not on a beach but very elegant lobby.
__label__0 The room was clean, but nothing special.
__label__0 My daughter said there were not enough outlets in the room for all the electronic appurtenances we travel with: two cell phone, pda and iPod chargers, curling iron etc.
__label__0 The mosquitos were not a problem either.
__label__0 Far cry from business type hotels
__label__1 make sure you have plenty of $1 bills or 50/100 peso notes the really do deserve their tips.
__label__0 But the buffet was delicious and diverse enough to keep our palettes satisfied-
__label__1 If you want an upgrade room, join the Guest Select program, and you will be sent a coupon for a free room upgrade coupon.
__label__0 The shower was hot and the water pressure strong.
__label__0 It is an excellent hotel at an excellent price
__label__0 Also, I will seriously consider this as my base hotel for visiting Amsterdam in the future, despite the fact that it is a brief train ride from the center of town.
__label__0 Saturday evening and I'm winding down-Seattleites are winding up-the noise level rises to a crescendo-its now 2 a.m.A water pipe ( a prominent celing to floor fixture) in the room,not to be outdone,comes to life with a gurgle
__label__0 Only downside was lack of air conditioning in rooms, but in May, it was fine and could open windows to let cool air in when it got warm.
__label__0 With last minute it was room only so no idea what the breakfast was like.
__label__0 They are building a new casino on site looks like it will be nice and when everthing is done it will look awsome.
__label__1 Dont hesitate to stay here unless you are upper class American and only expect the very very best.
__label__0 The lobby is beautiful.
__label__0 Rooms: Very nice, clean, clean, clean.
__label__0 The staff are friendly and the rooms, while small, are clean and well furnished.
__label__0 OverallIve been a very lazy trip advisor for years.
__label__0 The worst thing we encountered was the number of panhandlers downtown and at the wharf.
__label__0 My only complaint was that one night the television stopped working for no apparent reason, and the maintenance man was unable to fix it.
__label__0 For all the wealth that flows here, you will NOT feel out of place or of a lesser class.
__label__0 Room service was fantastic (gourmet larger than life BLT sandwiches and delicious kebabs  dips).
__label__0 This Sheraton is definitely not a 4-star hotel
__label__0 The tour bus goes from the end of the street and is close to Zoo Station.
__label__0 Now, I am not by any means saying that the food is bad, the food is very well prepared but I did not like most of their food because I am not use to eating European style food.
__label__0 In short....
__label__0 We enjoyed the ease of proximity to museums and good restaurants.
__label__0 I would stay here again - particularly once the pool reopens ;)!
__label__0 We could just bypass all of that with the elevator.
__label__0 And then there was the awkward design of a single swingdoor functioning alternatively for the separate toilet cubicle and the rest of the bathroom.
__label__0 The hotel has a nice location within walking distance from the convention center, space needle, waterfront, and Pike Place Market.
__label__0 Too much attention on 'fabulousness' throughout the hotel (the public spaces are sleek and unwelcoming) and not enough on basic guest comfort.
__label__0 The room had just been renovated and we were one of the first to stay in it.
__label__0 Stayed for three nights in July and wished it was longer
__label__0 In the morning we adults had an icecold shower, the kids refused to do so....
__label__0 The lobby of the hotel is small
__label__0 My only complaints:1, The cart system, while a great idea, was a bust for us.
__label__0 From the moment we arrived, the staff was very nice.
__label__0 and if you stay on the 30th floor or above,
__label__0 we waited 45 min for breakfast
__label__0 There is no free shuttle bus to Luquillo Beach which is about 10 minutes from the resort and simply mediocre nightlife inside the resort and not much too do in the municipality or province of Rio Grande where the resort is located ,you have no choice but to pay a taxi $140 to enjoy San Juans exciting nightlife ,.
__label__0 There seemed to be drag racing on the street outside until late in the morning,
__label__0 Sometimes the staff on the concierge desk spoke almost no English which was frustrating.
__label__0 It was beautiful
__label__0 Overall Hotel California offers a fantastic value.
__label__0 Flight was long, and there was not much direction as to how to get to the bus.Food was great.
__label__0 Thats a little too much if you ask me; overall, the city is still almost empty which is a shame.
__label__0 If you cant make an italian meal, dont advertise you can
__label__0 Staff was helpful and nice, breakfast was adequate, free internet access was a nice treat.
__label__0 The furniture is dark brown and very old and battered
__label__0 I read all the review and i thanks to them i decided to stay here.
__label__0 but if this is not included in your hotel package stay away.
__label__0 The location is great,
__label__0 and you had to walk through the bathroom to get to 1/2 the bedrooms.
__label__0 The bathroom was small.
__label__0 My room was not cleaned until very late in the day even
__label__0 We have just returned from four night stay at the SoHo from our friends wedding.
__label__1 If you go to this hotel don`t book a standard room.
__label__0 Can't beat the view on the 35th floor.
__label__0 We even got a free upgrade to a room with a ensuite.
__label__0 I told the desk person to find it
__label__0 The lounge had a great breakfast and offered drinks through the day including wine, etc. at evenings with appetizers.
__label__0 and of a good size and the bathroom was very nice.
__label__0 Of course, the valet was pricey, but we read the reviews ahead of time and worked it into our budget.
__label__0 Staff was not especially friendly,
__label__0 Definately would recommend, especially for the price.
__label__0 The free internet was a godsend.
__label__0 The only little complaint I had was that the room was a corner ,#827, and the left and front were all windows so the TV was actually to the right of the bed which made watching in bed difficult.
__label__0 I stayed here seven nights while attending a conference at the convention center.
__label__0 Mercato St. Lorenzo is just steps from the hotel.
__label__0 Never again!
__label__0 I know that that is what they do but come-on, $22 USD for a raw hamburger with fries?
__label__0 What more can you ask for?
__label__0 I dont know if this is a common occurrence when vacationing but it happened to them.
__label__0 Our first room was very small, the upholstery and lampshades(!) were stained, the furniture desperately needed to be refinished,
__label__0 I ended up spending $69 a night, which is a steal for downtown Seattle.
__label__0 Nice hotel, great location The Luna
__label__0 My husband and I spent the weekend at the W New Orleans ,Dec. 11 - Dec 12, 2004,.
__label__0 Free parking, which is a huge plus in Amsterdam.
__label__0 It was a couple who got married just 2 days ago.
__label__0 I went with my 15 year old daughter and a friend of mine.
__label__0 Next year, we are trying somewhere else.
__label__0 Got it via Hotwire for around $130/night (more like $155 including taxes)
__label__0 There is free wireless Internet access in the rooms and another nice touch is the free glass of wine served between 5 and 6 - this ensures the guests gravitate to the lounge and creates a warm, friendly atmosphere.
__label__0 we were very surprised to find that the hotel was not only in shambles from being under construction,
__label__0 A Quiet and Quaint
__label__0 All other spots were great.
__label__0 Terrible from start to finish
__label__0 Although the bed linen was clean there wasn't much going for the room at all.
__label__0 I cant wait to go back, my husband and I considered the hotel a high point of the trip.
__label__0 staff were less than helpful.
__label__0 Wait staff at the bar was very pleasant.
__label__0 Little terrace was lovely for sitting and relaxing.
__label__0 After reading all the reviews we decided to stay Friday night Oct 26th at the Four Seasons.
__label__0 We have been to Mexico many times, other areas as well, and have never experienced such horrendous service and apathy.
__label__0 You have to leave your car with the valet and the price to have it valetd is $27 per day plus tax and tips
__label__0 And this was true in my bedroom
__label__0 We travelled with Sunwing Vacations out of Toronto.
__label__0 The White House is about two blocks from the hotel and you certainly cant see it from the hotel.
__label__0 I stayed in a business class room on the sixth floor.
__label__1 The roof top pool, ok is on the small side but the beach is only 5 minutes walk away if you need more water
__label__0 I chose the Palace hotel after doing quite a bit of research on Berlin Hotels.
__label__0 It is possible to walk to the nearest station but it will not be that comfortable if you have luggage with you.
__label__0 and the smoke wafts through the hotel.
__label__0 When I asked for a non-smoking room I was told they were fully booked and I couldn't change.
__label__0 This was obviously not one of the renovated rooms.
__label__0 But as soon as you entered you could see the renovations
__label__0 The Gran Melia is world class.
__label__0 We ate in the Cafe/restaurant where the food was very good and again, the service top class.
__label__0 In fact there was one member of the staff who was outright rude.
__label__0 The price was certainly good.
__label__0 A very nice touch indeed.
__label__0 and we all checked in together and paid the same price!
__label__0 and I have never once had to wait for an occupied bathroom.
__label__0 Driving and parking is such a hassle, I would recommend using the metro.
__label__0 Meridien right after they took over from the Park Hyatt so things were still a bit chaotic-everything still said Hyatt.
__label__0 and they also did not have that...
__label__0 Needs no explaination.
__label__0 We booked a one bedroom suite which was on the 8th floor.
__label__0 I really recommend the Westin.
__label__1 I do recommand Kaffee Einstein.
__label__0 The rooms are simple, almost bare, and it does feel like the building has seen better days. There's no overnight parking which is my only real complaint about the place especially since parking is so dang expensive.
__label__0 most seemed a bit scary!.
__label__0 Nearby are a host of shops cafes and restaurants.
__label__0 Will probably never stay anywhere else in
__label__0 While it is not a full breakfast buffett, it sure is a nice to have something in your stomach before leaving the hotel.
__label__0 Had to get a room for a wedding in Hollywood and this property was available in what I knew was a relatively safe location and was at a reasonable price ,direct from HI website,.
__label__0 you come to the end of a regular-looking hotel corridor, pass through a lounge, and into a narrow, dark and musty corridor with doorways just about your height and barely wide enough to fit your carry-on luggage ... well,
__label__0 and it was pleasantly furnished, clean and comfortable.
__label__0 Reversed charge without a problem.
__label__1 If you are at all sensitive to noise, then it is very important that you get a room in the back of the hotel.
__label__0 More historical and cultural sites are within walking distance than we could possibly see in our 5 day stay.
__label__0 We stayed here for 2 nights after a cruise and were quite pleased.
__label__0 we checked into our 4th floor room and were very surprised when we opened the patio curtains only to find that we were looking directly at a cement wall about 2 feet away from the porch.
__label__0 Berlin has an awful lot of construction going on so choose carefully.
__label__0 That is a promise....
__label__0 Check in was smooth and friendly, the room spotless and quiet, the bed heaven, the bath products really nice, and best of all the location is fabulous - right in the World Square shopping area in Chinatown.
__label__0 Snorkeling really wasnt worth the effort.
__label__0 The rooms are beautiful.
__label__0 I'm not a terribly critical person, but I really hated this hotel.
__label__0 We never had lunch there, but Im sure it was good also.
__label__0 I had to call 3 times for the key and 2 for the lightbulb.
__label__0 Not a 5 star hotel in any way.
__label__0 Booked via e-mail, paid 95 euro per night in a double room without breakfast.
__label__1 My suggestion to anyone considering the Moore: If you want the low price, stay outside of DT since you will have to pay for parking anyways, or break the bank and stay at a nicer place!
__label__0 We had a great time in Berlin
__label__0 Room-service fast and delicious, great selection of food.
__label__0 and hadn't paid for breakfast.
__label__0 my husband is usually the one with the back pain!
__label__0 We just returned from a 3-night stay at the Hotel Warwick.
__label__0 Well, we paid only $130
__label__1 Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel.
__label__0 I do have to mention the staffs were excellent in all departments of the hotel, Very helpful.
__label__0 The experience was first class all the way.
__label__0 my last stay will likely be my last, despite the location, which is closest to my office.
__label__0 We were asked when we left if we could think of anyway the stay could have been better, we honestyly couldnt hink of anything at all.
__label__0 Our bathroom had a tub that overlooked the bay.
__label__0 while the location was great.
__label__0 The second room, pictured here, was much better.
__label__0 All in all a OK hotel, but not nice and cosy.
__label__0 We booked directly through the Marriotts website many months before and secured a favorable rate using the Senior discount.
__label__0 Not that big of a deal but maybe spend the $$ fixing these instead of a celing mounted radio that is useless
__label__0 Curtains made the room completely dark - perfect for sleeping in!
__label__0 We had booked a non-smoking room but were given a smoking room instead.
__label__1 I would recommend this hotel to anyone who likes a bit of style and comfort.
__label__0 We used this as our main transportation for the first two days and we saw basically everything without getting too overwhelmed.
__label__0 The menu was pretty good with a choice of steaks, pizzas, pastas and salads.
__label__0 Two of which were fine, one simply didnt do his job or meet our requests.
__label__1 If you are flying in I would suggest not renting a car as down Seattle can get crazy  parking is expensive.
__label__0 Great Location and really clean
__label__0 We were very pleased with the Hotel Andra, which is downtown in the Belltown area.
__label__0 If it turns up, we will call you.
__label__0 At the time I checked in, the fron desks said we dont have your reservation and there is no room available
__label__0 I was told nothing about this at check-in
__label__0 Kind of small and very crowded with families both times we went.
__label__0 Big comfy robes, cool ambiance, and a blissful sleep.
__label__0 Despite the intitial problem, it was dealt with in a more than satisfactory way and we would absolutely stay there again.
__label__0 We would definitely recommend this hotel to our friends.
__label__0 We had to walk up the stairs to the parking garage and get our confirmation from our luggage and only then did they find the reservation.
__label__0 The hotel is in a good location near the train station and within 5-10 minutes walk to the Mercato Centrale and the Duomo.
__label__0 Service is so so.
__label__0 The room and amenities are what you would normally expect from a 4-star Sheraton.
__label__0 It is very romantic, and the service is just outstanding
__label__0 They have an ironing board, iron, and hairdryer in each room and many things you can request from the front.
__label__0 when we saw secrets excellence at punta cana we instantly fell in love.
__label__0 (There is a small grocery/wine store across the street that is open until late, which was really nice!) The staff was not friendly, nor helpful.
__label__0 In there guest information stated that rooms had access to the internet
__label__1 Reception has safe deposit box if you need it.
__label__0 Luckily there are coffee shops on every corner once you leave the hotel.
__label__0 and the draws for clothes were below the mattress.
__label__1 Bottom line: pick another hotel, the Starwood Group has a white elephant on their hands with this smelly grand hotel.
__label__0 I and my daughter cannot think of one negative experience.
__label__0 Breakfast was very good, you could choose between coffee or tea, orange juice or cereal, fried egg, grilled bacon and baked beens, two boiled eggs or ham and tomato, and also they gave you toast with butter, jam and marmalade.
__label__0 One bad thing was that our shower curtain smelled of mildew.
__label__0 Once they realized that we were from America the price tripled for an average three hour excursion.
__label__0 The neighborhood was a bit scary at first with a few rundown houses and homeless folks, but it wasnt bad at all.
__label__0 Comfy, plush, great bedding.
__label__0 Elegant 1920's furnishings made the lobby a comfortable place to relax after museum hopping with a drink and a book while watching the world bustle by outside the window.
__label__0 We ended up getting a reservation at La Uva, for Wed night at 6pm ,oh well,, but we did not get another reservation the rest of the week.
__label__0 Great hotel away from the crowd
__label__0 The location was the best.
__label__0 meanwhile the lovely modern shower fixtures fell off the wall every single morning
__label__0 The service is also very good.
__label__0 The Cafe across the street, Cade De le Presse is delicous Order the french toast
__label__0 We had a Luxury Jacuzzi Gardenview Ste.....The best room ever.
__label__0 The bathroom was amazing.
__label__0 We arrived at the Paradisus around 4pm on the 18th and were greeted with a strawberry fruit drink while checking in, in the expansive, gorgeous open air lobby.
__label__0 It's a quick walk to the Public Market, downtown or the Seattle Art Museum.
__label__0 but it never happened.
__label__0 There was some construction going on while we were there it was a little distracting to the eyes.
__label__0 Tiny room (upgraded!) that looked out on a small interior space--had to keep curtains drawn at all times to prevent office workers across the airspace from looking in.
__label__1 Id suggest staying at this hotel but requesting a room that faces the main street and/or stay on the top floor.
__label__0 Some helpful and **FREE** amenities of the hotel include a very nice business center, and a small, well equipped gym on the second floor.
__label__0 It was easy to find, parking for free is a bonus and boy oh boy was Versa a wealth of information
__label__0 Really unprofessional.
__label__0 Service was excellent.
__label__0 I agree with another reviewer, that they have rooms for those that book a cheap rate
__label__0 When we changed to a renovated room were were delighted with the bathroom
__label__0 We did not want to leave.
__label__0 though I had the Please clean my room sign hung on my door since early morning.
__label__0 The beds were extremely comfortable ,new,.
__label__0 But for $60/night in downtown Seattle you can't expect luxury.
__label__0 The nice restaurant is gone (but there are many close to the hotel).
__label__0 We wanted to make this trip special, fun, and the resort ruined it.
__label__0 It is reasonably priced for its location.
__label__0 Id stay there everytime
__label__0 The entire hotel was spotless.
__label__0 Still, it was a great value and the location cant be beat.
__label__0 He got an extra guy to help with all of our gear.
__label__0 We were to attend the Mariners game on Saturday night and were running late as we were coming in from Eugene.
__label__0 The Intercontinental was fine
__label__0 Like someone has already pointed out; they seemed to struggle keeping up with things.
__label__1 The room is big for HK standards and there is a small kitchenette if you need to heat up food in the microwave or cook a meal.
__label__0 If you're lucky you might just come across a great beer garden near the spanish?
__label__0 I am absolutely sick that we are now stuck at this hotel.
__label__0 Hotel staff acknowledge this and have a LAN conversion kit which didn't work either.
__label__0 The hotel was nice enough - beautiful gardens, lovely pool, nice rooms ,but annoyingly damp - all the bedding smelled damp which was very unplesant,, but Nusa Dua itself was a dreadful disappointment.
__label__0 We have never been disappointed.
__label__0 Mexican - This was okay.
__label__0 and our window was directly opening to the car parking at the same level.
__label__0 We used Prieto, but found the Apple tours to be better organized.
__label__0 Yes, the air conditioning unit is noticeably noisy - I got used to the sound and didnt hear it within minutes, but if you get bothered by this sort of thing its something to note.
__label__0 The food in the restaurant was cold,
__label__1 For the location, you are much better off at the Hyatt Regency.
__label__0 It had a beautiful entertainment cabinet with a tv, dvd player and Sony Playstation.
__label__0 As too are the room doors so you cannot hear any other guests or morning maid service in the hallways.
__label__0 We were asked to have one night in the Intercontinental and come back to the Hilton for the remainder of our stay.
__label__0 and the food was really not good.
__label__0 The room was clean and HUGE
__label__0 I would have been perfectly happy if we had been offered this to begin with, and would have given the hotel a higher rating,
__label__0 Have recently returned from a four night stay in the lenox a great experience.
__label__0 The main entrance to the suite was awe inspiring.
__label__0 service was slow, and each time I ate in there (the first when we didn't know any better and the 2nd 2nd time was because of the food coupons) - either the silverware was dirty or the water glasses
__label__0 When we pointed out in so many words that this was something he ought to have checked out before turning us away and forcing us to make a 15euro call back home, he gave us free tickets to the Aqua land as a compensation.
__label__0 Depressing and not to be recommended.
__label__0 I think that their star rating should be brought down a notch or two.
__label__0 The staff was friendly and the food was good.
__label__0 We wanted a reasonably priced hotel in the middle of Seattle,
__label__0 It probably needs it again.
__label__0 So much for friendly staff
__label__0 The beds were as promised Heavenly with a pillow that could be moulded to suit any height preference.
__label__0 Talked with the doorman, Nick, who recommended a great dinner spot - the Queen Italian Restuarant.
__label__0 He was apologetic and claimed this was the first he'd heard of bed bugs in the Moore.
__label__0 and we will bring it to you.
__label__0 The goods: Location: Great.
__label__0 The TV in our room was damaged with poor sound quality and the bed slightly uncomfortable.
__label__0 We arrived in our car after a long journey from Las Vegas, and we were very tired.
__label__0 We stayed at the Hotel Casci on the first 2 nights of our 2 week trip.
__label__0 we were really looking forward to staying in a 5 star hotel.
__label__0 To our surprise they upgraded us the a bigger room.
__label__0 For me, the best feature of this place is the outstanding service by the staff.
__label__0 There were not enough tables for everyone
__label__0 Great hotel; Great service
__label__0 Ah well, we just kept the light closed and laughed it off
__label__0 I am very particular
__label__0 and we found out there were only 2 rooms occupied on our floor so it was very quiet!
__label__0 51 total--it is not worth the money at ALL.
__label__0 They dont have a menu posted so you have no idea what is even offered.
__label__1 Finally, if you stay here, be very careful when going down into the metro and all of the time you stay on the metro.
__label__0 The double room was in fact 2 twin beds so you will have to move them together
__label__1 Brilliant Hotel - would recommend to anyone.
__label__0 I was told that all windows are being replaced with double-paned glass.
__label__0 Great location, cost effective
__label__0 We stayed on the seventeeth floor.
__label__0 The beds were heavenly as promised, and the dual shower was great too.
__label__0 Once we did it we started noticing others doing the same thing which does sound like furniture moving.
__label__0 The rooms were clean and tidy and the free breakfast each morning was great.
__label__0 Lovely Small Hotel
__label__0 Security is also very evident and appreciated.
__label__0 Our favorite beach was Blue Beach and Playa Luna.
__label__0 The uber-efficient cleaning staff will attempt multiple times to clean your room if you don't have the sign displayed.
__label__0 but all the instructions for the audio/video equipment are in German
__label__0 I stayed at the Westin Berlin 3 or 4 times.
__label__0 We bought an octopus card at the airport for HK300 which included round trip train from the airport to Hong Kong station and 3 days of unlimited MTR rides.
__label__0 Pike's Market, shopping and restaurants are all close by.
__label__0 We didnt get to eat at the Mexican restaurant,which we heard was outstanding, because it was only open two nights we were there and we had reservations at the other two restaurants those nights.
__label__0 Service was very nice, and the beach was awesome
__label__0 and boy were we wrong!
__label__0 However, just a couple of small things - one of our triple rooms was really small, only fit as a double and there was no mirror in the bedroom at all, just the bathroom mirror so it was a bit of hassle when 3 women were getting ready to go out.
__label__0 and that that room was booked.
__label__0 Flights Virgin ,Direct booking, Truly Rubbish service both ways and I like Virgin.
__label__0 I dont know how people can say the Health Club was nice.
__label__0 There are plenty of nice hotels in Seattle.
__label__0 The hotel is well positioned for MRT and all modes of transport and the taxis certainly are cheap.
__label__0 Shuttle from airport worked well.
__label__0 Truly truly gob smacking pioneering customer service with little touches everywhere, amazing gracious service.
__label__0 What a DUMP... there are much better accomodations for the same price
__label__0 The Moore Hotel said that unless they wrote my drivers license down - I wouldn't be allowed to rent a room.
__label__0 The restaurant attached to the hotel, however, is quite mediocre and very noisy, with unresponsive staff.
__label__0 Absolutely loved this hotel and its staff
__label__0 To make it even better they should add robes
__label__0 Great Service And Lovely Rooms
__label__0 Also worth the price was the Jeep Safari, be prepared for drivers that know not what traffic lights or stop signs are or know which side of the road to drive on assuming the one or 2 roads we were on were even paved.
__label__0 Staff are superb throughout the hotel.
__label__0 The furnishings and fittings are still in good condition.
__label__0 The room was on climate control
__label__0 Breakfast was included in the price although nothing to shout home about,
__label__0 I just got back from staying at Hotel Vintage Park and their staff is excellent.
__label__0 When i was settling into room, front staff said they located a two queen room
__label__0 the breakfast is excellent, friendly staff and lovely lobby with pianist.
__label__0 The beach was within easy walking distance.
__label__0 I did however get an extremely strange feeling in the room, and was not keen to stay for a reason that is unknown to me
__label__0 The true disappointed came when we checked into the room.
__label__0 The window of our room is facing the back of Medici Chapel, a warm scene in the morning of winter season.
__label__1 If you're going to Seattle, look hard at spending a little extra for another hotel - and you'll probably even end up right in the center of downtown.
__label__0 Yes, you must overlook some of the workmanship, but the hotel is beautiful, the pool was awesome and the beach is spectacular.
__label__0 It was supposed to be a designer hotel,
__label__0 The staff was very friendly and did their best to please us.
__label__0 there is nothing here that special,
__label__0 The elder lady was nice, but the  next evening, the younger ( not young !
__label__0 The decor is modern and relatively new.
__label__0 Only minor point was that they are strict about no ironing in the room and no in room tea/coffee in normal double rooms.
__label__0 If we choose to return, we would stay in the new tower and park the car across the street.
__label__0 Once we had seen the picture, we were hooked and when we saw it, we knew we had made the right choice.
__label__0 5 minutes later he is finished and leaves.
__label__0 No shampoo provided in the room, Shower Gel dispensers don't work well.
__label__0 But, they seem to have only one person on reception and one on bell duty at any given time, including prime check-in/check-out times.
__label__0 There is a 2 hour cocktail hour everyday from 6-8 where you can get free drinks and snacks, while tipping of course, and breakfast is also free and a huge variety of items to choose from.
__label__0 but instead they spent their renovation money on new bedspreads.
__label__0 These wonderful people and anyone else whose names I didnt get, made this a wedding and honeymoon well never forget.
__label__0 It was our fourth stay at the hotel and this hotel has it all.
__label__0 In the first 2 days we were moved to 4 different rooms because of various problems ,original rooms safety box was broken, then we asked to be moved to a more quiet section, then the new room they gave us wasnt made up and when no one came after 4 hours we went to the reception desk where they upgraded us to a Tropical Junior Suite for the all the inconvenience.
__label__0 The second time we asked for transportation we were told our destination was too far away.
__label__0 Walking time to many sights (Unter den Linden, Gendarmenmakt, Deutches Museum, Checkpoint Charlie, Nikolaivertel etc. was less than 15 minutes - while virtually everything else was easily accessible by U-Bahn, starting almost next door.
__label__0 Entry was via a buzzer system operated from the reception area, then a security card key to your suite.
__label__0 But this place delivers for all intents and purposes, no doubt.
__label__0 Its in a good position to see the sites of old East Berlin and close to public transport to go further afield.
__label__0 Also as I was staying only one night-how bad could it be.
__label__0 Within walking distance of Pike Street, Needle, Jazz Clubs, Fine Restruants, and just plain city kicking around.
__label__0 Being able to walk to Pike Place Market, which took about 5 minutes, helped us out because we had limited sightseeing time in Seattle.
__label__0 LOVED the Hotel Lungarno
__label__0 Due to the comfy chairs I usually fell asleep.
__label__0 I would recommend the HHV only because I dont know how you could have a bad experience here.
__label__0 Go see the Budda and take cable car either there or back.
__label__0 We waited thirty and it still had not arrived, so after two calls down ,and snotty clerks, we just left.
__label__0 The location is good for touring.
__label__0 Desk staff was helpful with questions.
__label__0 The room is modern and has a good size.
__label__0 and the waiter was great.
__label__0 Tables where not cleaned, and even the food was short in the last hour,
__label__0 There was no space near the tub to hang a towel.
__label__0 The hotel bar is unique with a revolving central carousel.
__label__0 The new is 4 star
__label__0 It was newly renovated, clean and had a modern design.
__label__0 They said this problem can normally happen and just sent us to the other hotel with the same owner but was much more far away ,quite not responsible,.
__label__0 He seemed less than apologetic and asked for payment for the wine!
__label__0 Indeed, what irked the most was that the room was full of overpriced bottles of mineral water that they could have offered to guests during this time to use.
__label__0 The regular junior suites are amazing.
__label__1 Note that if you plan to rent a car, many rental places have minimum 3 day rentals during high season.
__label__0 We were nearly at the top so views, while not spectacular, weren't bad since you see above most everything other building.
__label__0 We also had the pleasure of going to a hotel called Ala Moana Hotel.
__label__0 This isnt some one time accident.
__label__0 It was roomy, clean, in a great location; they serve a great selection of breakfast items FREE; and the service we got from the staff at the desk was prompt and very friendly.
__label__0 We found the lack of available reservations, and the logistics of the reservation system in general ,you dont find out if you have a dinner reservation until the afternoon - or evening -
__label__0 Everyone we traveled with was 19 and older and I must say I am happy we chose the Bavaro.
__label__0 we stayed one night at the loews hotel miami beach where we have stayed many times and then moved to this hotel for 2 nights.
__label__0 Both a great day out.
__label__0 I was quite pleased with this hotel.
__label__0 I have just returned from a weekend in Berlin, where I stayed at the Berlin Mark Hotel.
__label__0 I would certainly stay there again.
__label__0 we stayed at the Ritz Carlton  paid a similar price to the Hilton; on our next visit we will certainly go back to the Ritz Carlton, as it is that bit more special.
__label__0 and sauna area- they are dangerous.
__label__0 I contacted them via their web site and reserved about six weeks in advance.
__label__0 No noise from the construction.
__label__0 The bathroom have a open sewer of a kind, next to the bathtub that exhales the most noxious odor.
__label__0 I was booked in here for 4 nights [ a single female traveller].
__label__0 See my review of Senator Gran Via where I stayed the preceding week.
__label__0 This is unusual and may be due to size of the rooms but for such a well thought out hotel, I thought this was a significant issue.
__label__0 good liquor selection; self-serve, soft-serve ice cream at the outdoor bars.
__label__0 All in all this hotel should be classified three star
__label__0 Loved our Room
__label__0 but the pool was rather cold and we therefore only used it once.
__label__0 I will not name him, but when we had a problem with our room,
__label__0 Nothing wrong with that, however, little has been done to update the facilities to provide for modern conveniences, save for the free high speed wireless internet.
__label__0 Close to the hotel are the 100
__label__0 My working sister appreciated the free wi-fi.
__label__0 and wired internet was $10.
__label__0 Actually a standard room with a connecting door into a parlor room.
__label__0 I had to ask for bathrobes which were advertised as part of the room package, but they were delivered promptly.
__label__0 great property Great hotel--very detailed.
__label__0 Really liked the room and had no problems with noise.
__label__0 Still, the location is the best
__label__0 We were finally given an alternate room, which did not have as good a view as originally ordered, but was OK.
__label__0 Rooms were great, as well.
__label__0 My request to speak to the Manager was ignored as was a letter whilst I was staying there.
__label__0 They also rent beach chairs, coolers and beach towels.
__label__0 trucks and buses could be heard at all hours of the day.
__label__0 we decided to opt for that.
__label__0 Thanks to your reviews, I was able to eliminate some of my potential choices and to pick the Hotel Metro, where we got a family suite with 2 bedrooms- one for Mom Dad, and one for the teen-age girls.
__label__0 The bugs are still there and now the room smells like raid.
__label__1 Make sure to go to Aberdeen and take a sanpan ride.
__label__0 Caribe Hilton is one of the first Hiltons in the chain, built in 1947, and continually upgraded.
__label__0 Tinker to improve, yes.
__label__0 I wouldnt come back here if I measured this trip solely based on food but check the other reviews for comments on the two reservation only restaurants ,Le Gourmet and Matsuri, because the food their might be really good.
__label__0 The room was spacious although a little outdated.
__label__0 Checked in at 10pm and the front desk staff was very courteous and cheerful and checked me in promptly.
__label__0 I am not sure that this is the fault of the hotel though.
__label__0 We picked this hotel because of the great deal we received on the internet.
__label__0 That was awesome
__label__0 50% more expensive than in a restaurant.
__label__0 We had breakfast in the restuarant and it was good although there are plenty of other good restaurants and diners nearby.
__label__0 Ok lets start, check in went well, until we found out we had two double beds instead of the king we asked for when we booked the trip back in nov.Not a big deal.
__label__0 but I would have spent a lot of time in it to make up for the deficiencies of this place.
__label__0 They only have one place to eat
__label__1 I was here many times before and have seen all kind of rooms , make sure, you get an renovated one with Heavenly Bed,.
__label__0 I cant describe how perfect our stay at this hotel was....I cant wait to go back
__label__0 I mentioned my foot at check out the next morning
__label__0 My friend and I stayed at the Elan in late February.
__label__0 Towels were small and very rough.
__label__0 The Seattle Sheraton has no sense of customer service.
__label__0 Breakfast had a lot of variety and was very good Would definitely stay there again
__label__0 Immediately we were meet by the Hotels bell man at the taxi door
__label__0 It is a bit out of the way though, all the way at the of the Rocks.
__label__0 It is close to public transportation, close to many of the city attractions and close to the start of the marathon.
__label__0 You do not have to go far to experience excellent offerings.
__label__0 They suggested restaurants and treated the kids like family.
__label__0 They did have one room available, but it was leaking as well.I spoke to the manager, Joanna Turmo, about my room.
__label__1 We would recommend the Laurel enthusiastically to our friends, unless they need to be downtown.
__label__0 We ate at Cafe du Monde, Johnny Poboys, and Mothers.
__label__0 Great location, views
__label__0 There are only about 2 blocks which I would consider bad,
__label__0 The lobby is somewhat chic and the neighborhood is a very typical Hollywood neighbor hood.
__label__0 But the rooms are small and not very functional.
__label__0 No need to look further Just returned from a three-day stay over the July 4th Holiday.
__label__0 We found the staff ,especially the reception and bar staff, extremely friendly.
__label__0 Staff very nice, but couldn't change the room.
__label__0 Again no indication of any willingness to help.
__label__0 The beach staff at the Flamenco were interested only in selling us the motorized sports that were not included in our package.
__label__0 This door wasn't even full-length, so it must be a real problem for American couples with their hang-ups about bodily sounds when on the toilet.
__label__0 but I didn't have time to take advantage of it.
__label__1 Travellers considering staying at the mediocre Hostelling International Seattle should seriously consider staying at the Moore instead.
__label__0 front desk had attitude.
__label__0 I've stayed at the Sheraton Seattle numerous times on business over the last 3 years.
__label__0 and others were not at all.
__label__0 Every single employee treated us as royalty, or better yet as their family.
__label__0 The bathroom door has a hole for a handle,
__label__0 The poolside food was vertually inedible, soggiy cold sandwiches, and watered drinks.
__label__0 They work and work and work to make this resort clean and comfortable.
__label__0 Great place, lovable staff
__label__0 while i took my (occasionally cold) shower.
__label__0 we took our parent with us and we all truly relaxed and enjoyed every moment.
__label__0 Very nice reception.
__label__0 you can buy drinks from outside the hotel for l.60 euro. bed sheets were never changed during that week and room was never cleaned.
__label__0 Easy walk to the Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag and Check point _���_Charlie_���.
__label__0 Refills were offered twice during our entire stay in the main dining room.
__label__0 Overall a very good hotel and efficient front desk staff who had good English speaking skills.
__label__1 So dont trust the staff, and be prepared for them to try it on and cause problems.
__label__0 The hotel is well located and the renovated rooms were adequate in terms of size and amenities but I would not rate them 4 star.
__label__0 Yes, the public spaces are nicely designed,
__label__0 We were in Block 6 ,Elite Club section, and were treated to an oceanview room on the first floor.
__label__1 Bigger rooms , bar at ground floor, bigger reception, but then it wouldnt be the hotel that it is .
__label__0 The spa facilities are also nice but cost an extra __�_7 per day.
__label__0 Always ready to help or offer advice.
__label__0 Overall the hotel is nice and a good deal.
__label__0 and I would be happy to stay there again.
__label__0 Across the street is a gourmet market--Ralph's--that stays open 'till midnight, and a bakery called Dahlia's--known for their coconut cream pie.
__label__0 and of course the street noise became unbearable.
__label__0 I was a little disappointed at the variety of fruit for the most part, but I always found something yummy to try at the buffet.
__label__0 underneath the bedspread, there are 2 twin comforters, which is wierd for a queen room.
__label__0 The room was very spacious with a nice bathroom and nice amenities.
__label__0 Overall, it was a really good hotel.
__label__0 The restaurant (Mark Brandenburg) was over-priced and had marginal food.
__label__0 The room was clean but bare of any decoration.
__label__0 It would comfortably fit two people, maybe three.
__label__0 Unfortunately I ended up in the latter half!
__label__0 We enjoyed our vacation, but we have stayed at several Gran Bahia hotels befor and found it allitle blaw as we knew what to expect.
__label__0 They are wearing uniforms and are there to to a job and most of them do it quite admirably.
__label__0 That was pretty much the only contact we had with her.
__label__0 but this was particularly central.
__label__0 There is absolutely no information in your room about anything to do with the resort.
__label__0 Love Casa Alta Vista
__label__0 Check in was fine.
__label__0 They couldn't spare us one and said they didn't have any.
__label__0 Only problem was with room service close to closing time of restaurant.
__label__0 There was some road noise at night, not from the main road directly below, but from the free-way behind, but this didnt spoil our much needed sleep.
__label__0 In short, if the service at this hotel were up to par, it would be a good choice.
__label__0 Convieniently, the room had its own sink.
__label__0 Most of the items were deep fried.
__label__0 Especially for the price.
__label__0 and the staff was astoundingly incompetent and insincere.
__label__0 I called the front desk and was told someone would be out immediately.
__label__1 If you need to get out and roam, this is not the resort for you, as you are miles away from anything, however there is so much to do right there at the resort I cant imagine why you would need to go anywhere.
__label__0 The steakhouse and the Japanese were the best.
__label__0 I stayed in this hotel in November, 2005.
__label__0 The German restaurant, Mark Brandenburg, simply had the best German food I've ever had (and I've been to Germany about 8-9 times).
__label__1 My suggestion would be to have a donut and coffee for breakfast, you're in Seattle after all!
__label__0 and the staff were happy to move us to a less smelly non-smoking room when we asked.
__label__0 and it was just fine.
__label__0 and despite telling the cleaner it was still not changed.
__label__0 So, after only 2 nights, I lugged my stuff down the escalator with no help, across the street and checked into the JW a day early.
__label__0 My advice to you is stay here.
__label__0 My room was spacious and the interior looked very new.
__label__0 Hi everyone by the adult pool
__label__0 The food was plentiful and very tasty.
__label__0 Great location in front of a u-bahn stop.
__label__0 Aside from my dealings with the owner ,who was less than hospitable and crossed out my entry in their guest book,, the staff were great and the hotel was clean and modern.
__label__0 Nothing.
__label__0 It had a marble countertop, two cushioned bar stools w/ backs, two refrigerators under the sink/countertop.
__label__0 80% of the people IN the hotel couldnt care less about whether guests are there.
__label__0 You can get these at the Union Square half-price ticket window.
__label__0 All reception staff were great and more than ready to answer any questions we might have had.
__label__0 They put us in a hospitality suite with two roll-aways!
__label__0 We arrived via Apple Vacations and check-in took around 2 hours... chaos at the front desk.
__label__1 If you go to Oahu whereever you stay you HAVE to eat at Aarons in the Ala Moana hotel.
__label__0 I turned on the heat and the room was at a comfortable temperature by the time I had finished unpacking.
__label__0 Fortunately, the Sheraton is a few blocks away from great shopping and walking through the snow wasn't bad at all.
__label__0 We were lucky enough not to get the two twin beds pushed together although this was the hardest bed I have slept on.
__label__1 I understand things happen, an apology would have been nice.
__label__0 Bedroom- we had taken a slight upgrade room on the 5th Floor was spacious, well equipped.
__label__0 The wing where our rooms were had bad smell.
__label__0 The service was a bit slow at the steakhouse, but give them time.
__label__0 but rather a ventilation system which did not cool the room down, opening the windows meant that the system switched off
__label__0 Housekeeping did respond quickly and cleaned the entire bathroom,
__label__0 The restaurants were all good.
__label__0 although the marble in the bathrooms could have used a thorough cleaning as they had dirt and rust stains.
__label__0 The pool and gym are are really beautiful.
__label__0 and only stocked the bathroom supplies once for a 3 night stay.
__label__0 We even walked to Pike's Place and the Aquarium one day and the Seattle Center another (yeah, the monorail was down also!).
__label__0 she had trouble sleeping.
__label__0 bottle of water in the vending machine was ridiculous - the picture showed a full size water bottle.
__label__0 and the service provided was unpleasant.
__label__0 Clean Hotel, Friendly staff, no complaints
__label__0 I utilized Expedia and got a double queen for 65.00 a night.
__label__0 We walked just about everywhere.
__label__0 In fact the bathroom showed a bit of wear.
__label__0 My wife and I stayed two nights at this hotel at the end of February.
__label__0 Breakfast was included in our deal,
__label__0 I was told by a counter help that your room is locked in for the 14th floor and two beds.
__label__0 and I the head of the tap came off.
__label__0 and the hallway had bits of garbage all throughout that no one bothered to clean up during our stay.
__label__0 I travel to Seattle and have stayed in a number of hotels there -- notably the Edgewater and Monaco.
__label__0 I stayed for two periods - the first I was upgraded to a suite which was beautifully furnished, clean and except for some electrical problems with operating the Jacuzi, was well above the standard I expected.
__label__0 It must have been decorated by the owner of a hospital.
__label__0 The breakfast room was very well presented, and you can also breakfast outside or in the bar area.
__label__0 We stayed at the Brooklyn Bridge Marriott for one night before boarding a cruise out of Brooklyn.
__label__0 Again, I was not informed of this in advance, nor at check-in
__label__0 The first night was fine,
__label__0 I must give them credit at least they left the mirror on my windshield, so I guess they werent thieves, just vandals.
__label__0 I must say the location in superb.
__label__0 and hand-held shower which was a nice touch.
__label__0 and splutterand keeps this up until 5. a.m an hour after the Seattlitesdecide its time to go home.
__label__0 Can't complain about the rooms.
__label__0 Good clean rooms, breakfasts were more than ample and served well.
__label__0 The housekeeping staff was very thoughtful about when they cleaned the rooms and they did a great job.
__label__0 We checked out the first thing the next morning and went to the Hyatt which was wonderful.
__label__0 Bus to the ballpark is right in front.
__label__0 we had a 2 bedroom room for 125 euro a night including breakfast for 3 people, fab price, hotel in great location for ku dam and also for underground stations,
__label__0 A good value, with a few kinks
__label__0 I did not like the toiletries that came with the hotel however.
__label__0 The food was disappointing in presentation and flavour
__label__0 The rooms are fresh, crisp, well maintained, bathrooms are spacious enough and the open bathroom is easily rectified by simply drawing the blinds.
__label__0 When I was ready to leave for the airport, I just went to the front and the Downtown Airporter bus pulled right up and took me to the airport for just $10.25 ,$17 roundtrip,
__label__0 Is this the Hilton?
__label__0 Stayed 3 nights in March.
__label__0 I had to leave immediately after my conference and the concierge arranged for a cab to be there waiting for me so I could make my flight.
__label__0 The rooms are very comfortable - typical Hilton decor - nice sheets and good showers.
__label__0 A further complaint was the difficulty in finding information related to their parking accommodations which turned out to cost an additional $27/day.
__label__0 We learned this the hard way, after dining there- Front Desk Staff should have told us of this exclusion on day one but forgot ,?,.
__label__0 Also had a fabulous meal at the Metro Grill next door.
__label__0 The shower had no height adjustment bar
__label__0 Monorail station is just 2 blocks away.
__label__0 This is inconceivable, especially given that the rate was $30 more per night than at the JW Marriott across the street and that property is completely renovated
__label__0 loved it!
__label__0 Anyway, having upgraded to the tower room with two queen beds, we had absolutely no complaints.
__label__0 The room was just wonderful and was well furbished with a large bed and a working desk.
__label__0 and a complimentary bottle of water - the tap water was too chlorinated
__label__0 We originally booked a partial ocean view to save money.
__label__0 We looked around at some alternatives but we reckon this is the best value hotel on the beach front and cannot recommend it highly enough.
__label__0 Most people should be able to find what they want...another couple or a group to hang out with, or a quiet corner to sunbathe or read a book.
__label__1 Avoid these rooms - it is very clear why they do not have a photograph of them on their web site.
__label__0 and allowed my bicycle into the room- it was only 2 blocks from the Pike market which had all kinds of healthly foods.
__label__0 A nice place and I would probably stay there again.
__label__0 Not worth the reputation
__label__0 while we were watching TV loudly.
__label__0 The royal service pool was pleasant and very cozy, the staff was very wonderful.
__label__0 Everything worked well though
__label__0 Two lounge chairs were struck in the corner where you couldn't really even see the TV.
__label__0 There is easy access to food downstairs, Starbucks on the corner, ABC Markets everywhere.
__label__0 First, the resort is about an hour from the international airport in Isla Verde and transportation is not included to and from the hotel ,$120 round trip for 2 adults,.
__label__1 I have to comment to anyone who is thinking of going to a Caribbean Resort...YOUR VACATION IS AS GOOD OR BAD AS YOUR EXPECTATION.
__label__0 I was in charge of my event and everyone on my staff found the Hyatt personnel to be helpful, cheerful and accommodating.
__label__0 Love the new design and the subway tiles in the bathroom.
__label__0 more like a bitter sip of bad coffee at the end of a great meal.
__label__1 Weve stayed in San Francisco before and I would recommend the Commodore Hotel or another Experience Rewards hotel in the SF area.
__label__0 The location is perfect.
__label__0 The bed was very uncomfortable  old
__label__0 Too late!
__label__0 It is only a short walk away from the Eiffel tower.
__label__0 Metro and Tram services are excellent and close by.
__label__1 You can also use the star ferry, pennies, on the Kowloon side which will drop you island side adjacent to harbour city mall which is a good spot to take the classic harbour panoramic photo.
__label__0 We used the complimentary shuttle downtown to pick-up our rental car and the driver was very kind as well.
__label__0 My room had a great view of the Ala Wai Canal.
__label__0 There was a Sainsburys supermarket close to the hotel and also a Tesco.I will definitely stay there again
__label__0 Considering I had just arrived ,with my three kids, it wasnt likely I was buying drinks for some stanger in a bar.
__label__0 The last time we stayed in Berlin (June),
__label__0 We enjoyed our stay, but we always make the best of a situation.
__label__0 Our kids loved the Ritz-kids program which we tried for a day and much to our dismay the kids preferred to be in the program than to visit the island with us.
__label__0 The redeeming point was the hotel's location which was superb.
__label__0 Now that I've stayed there I realize it would have been just as cost effective to spend a little more and stay somewhere that provided some comfort.
__label__0 Rooms look worn and bed linens are not changed on a daily basis.
__label__0 The business center has a couple computers and even a printer for guests ,internet service in rooms requires an extra fee,.
__label__1 To get a cheap rate, look around online for the lowest rate, then call the motel directly.
__label__0 The hotel is in a very good location, close to the train station and other city attractions.
__label__0 You go to a mini buffet first for your side dishes and the servers bring you cuts of meat ,shish kabob style, directly to your table.
__label__0 Well definitely stay there again :-,
__label__0 On the positive side the breakfast and the breakfastroom were very nice and the personnel was nice ,untill I complaint about the bugs,.
__label__0 I was served a bowl of RICE drowning in a watery cream sauce with parmesan and canned mushrooms.
__label__0 There are minor marks on the wall and such.
__label__0 This is exactly what a dream hotel stay should be.
__label__0 worst luck!!
__label__0 The receptionist then informed us that dispite booking on Expedia with this hotel,
__label__0 However, the 5th floor had a number of internet terminals and most of the time we did not have to wait to use.
__label__0 Paid $209 for a basic king bedroom.
__label__0 The rooms were spacious.
__label__0 Wouldnt return to New York though, thought it was just the same as any other city.
__label__0 Basically everything we would have expected from a hotel under this brand.
__label__0 Food service French Gourmet - nice presentation but no seasoning, very bland and no taste.
__label__0 We were also right next to one of the Christmas markets, which was handy.
__label__0 Unfortunately the dryers broke after I put my clothing in the washer.
__label__0 In fact, the breakfast buffet gave an American, a Chinese and a finicky 5-year-old great choices.
__label__0 48 hours in Firenze
__label__0 Reception staff were plain rude
__label__0 This hotel was very modern and sleek.
__label__0 this was a lovely start to the holiday.
__label__0 Excellent hotel I booked this hotel based on the reviews.
__label__0 It was also pretty cold.
__label__0 I questioned him why he had taken our wine order surely knowing full well there was no food left.
__label__0 2.- People that are cleaning your rooms and serving your food are always with a smile on their faces and are always polite to everybody and should always be tiped well.
__label__0 I ended up calling and talking to the manager about the reservations department.
__label__0 So no closet, no chest of draws and a room the size of a phonebox.
__label__0 The staff are extremely friendly and helpfull, ready to help with anything, especially your bags, there is no elevator ,heritage building,.
__label__0 Great Hotel My girlfriend and
__label__0 I really wanted to settle it all on the phone
__label__0 We ate in the Americano on our last evening which was buzzing with an afterwork crowd, the restuarant too was busy, the wine list was good and the food was very good.
__label__0 The hotel was selected due to the proximity of a convention I attended at the Mascone Convention Center.
__label__0 I will spare you the details,
__label__0 If you go on the Quervo Fun Fun cave tour, it is not for the faint of heart
__label__0 it was amazing.
__label__0 Good sushi restaurant around the corner and a starbucks nearby
__label__0 The gym has several quite fancy treadmills and some free weights.
__label__0 I probably enjoyed the main buffet the best just for the variety.
__label__0 Would not hesitate to return.
__label__0 The staff was friendly and energetic.
__label__0 Suddenly, the receptionist found a reservation for us which means that they had expected us all along and was about to check us into that hotel when she realised that her colleague had sent us off to another property.
__label__0 We were never kept waiting to get in form more than a minute.
__label__0 Just thought I should mention this as I have stayed at 3 star, 4 star and 5 star hotels in the Dominican and the difference between them is minimal as far as the quality of food.
__label__0 so I think when you read these reviews, you have to take into consideration that everyone sees things differently.
__label__0 I had booked 2 beds for more space so we thoroughly inspected the other bed and slept in that one.
__label__0 Was confused how to get from airport to hotel so emailed the hotel - response was fantastic with detailed maps depending on your choice of transportation.
__label__0 Management was receptive to comments upon check out, but acknowledged that the hotel was having trouble with staffing/noise/growing pains.
__label__0 Rooms were clean , recently refurbished and inexpensive.
__label__0 Hotel was standard 3 stars
__label__1 Oh, and they like to keep your key at the front desk - there is only ONE KEY available per room, so if you're sharing with someone but have different itineraries, make a habit of dropping the key off at the front desk.
__label__0 The Beach and pool area had bugs that bit me but didnt bother anybody else in our group.
__label__0 breakfast was very good.
__label__0 We walked there as well and the walk was not too bad at all.
__label__0 It was so easy but the other women at the front desk were horrible on helping anyone and even one tried to be confrontational.
__label__0 I was pleased with the staff,
__label__0 Room window are large and can be opened for fresh air, and 25% of the rooms have private balconies featuring a small table and two chairs.
__label__0 breakfast was excellent and the beds are fabulous
__label__0 I hope they update their website to advise of this.
__label__0 It seemed recently renovated with an updated decor.
__label__0 Strike one. 
__label__0 The sheets were not changed for three days
__label__1 PARKING: is $43 plus tax per day; watch out
__label__0 The hotel is situated in the only area of the city that has not seen major redevelopment in the past 20 years.
__label__0 Tips for Berlin: Public transport is brilliant.
__label__0 That said, our upstairs neighbours also tried theirs and it leaked into our bathroom.
__label__0 I went down to the reception
__label__0 We stayed at the Royal Hawaiian for two weeks in January 2005 and loved it.
__label__0 I got a much better deal at the Marriott Potsdamer Platz on a previous trip.
__label__0 The hotel is great.
__label__0 There was garbage ,straws, cigarette butts, cups, broken glass, all over the place.
__label__0 But to end on a more positive note: A plus for the flatscreen TV with many international channels, for the in-room coffee- and teamaking equipment, and, last but certainly not least, for very good beds.
__label__0 Thanks to a busy work schedule, I did not get to spend much time in the area around the hotel.
__label__0 When I asked that night, he said we had to call down in the morning....
__label__0 Be warned if you are a bit of a prude as most guests are followers of the naked spa regime!
__label__0 and gloomy with 2 inconvenient steps down and this just about sums up the hotel.
__label__0 We are Diamond HHonor memebers,
__label__0 The breakfast buffet was the best that we had during our trip--and we were in 8 different hotels during our stay.
__label__0 The meat on the skewers were delicious.
__label__1 Be careful not to wander into attic late at night though as carpet is very damp.
__label__0 Located in an area with lots of nice shops and restaurants, particularly in a shopping center only 1 block away.
__label__0 The food was great and always plentiful and was replenished regualrly.
__label__0 These are outdoor and in the open but there is a semi private hut near the 24 hour snack bar.
__label__0 He was the most helpful member of staff we came across our entire stay!
__label__0 When we came back in the afternoon, our luggages had been brought in the room at 2nd floor.
__label__0 I did notice this last time that some of the carpets/fixtures in the room were showing their age but when the price, location and staff are this welcoming, who could argue?
__label__0 As a family member of a Starwood Hotels employee I have stayed at many Westin properties
__label__1 for the standard they boast, you are better off staying in a lesser star establishment where you will get better service.
__label__0 Stay there and enjoy, we did.
__label__0 The hotel is across from Victoria Park, which is great.
__label__0 The rooms are small but clean.
__label__1 If you get a great rate per night, like I did using a voucher system, is OK, but otherwise stay elsewhere.
__label__0 Cost was on an excellent deal only EU.
__label__0 Breakfast was great.
__label__0 Our room was spacious and the bed very comfy.
__label__0 Pleasant stay just before christmas, hotel was quite packed.
__label__1 Buy your tickets at the Wharf, not the concierge - they only have 1-day passes.
__label__0 I guess I had expected more since we had booked this reservation months in advance.
__label__0 The only thing we found that our room did not have were drawers to keep our clothes in, so we had to live out of our suitcases.
__label__0 I think that is not their business to judge
__label__0 While the room was spacious,
__label__0 The shampoo felt like watered down laundry detergent.
__label__0 Most of the people I encountered outside of the hotel were very nice.
__label__0 This is also a source of cold air.
__label__0 However, how this hotel is ranked as high as it is, is a mystery.
__label__0 (It's not in the center of downtown like the other hotels, but it's only a 5 or 6 block walk).
__label__0 but I was still very disappointed with the floor that we stayed on
__label__0 It had actually been received at the hotel at 10:00a.
__label__0 Positives: Location is great for exploring the city (sight seeing, shopping, restaurants/clubs/bars),
__label__0 The design of the public spaces is very imaginative and the art work throughout the hotel is excellent.
__label__0 After a work conference in Monterey ,avoid the Hyatt Monterey - yuck, my husband and I checked into the Omni for the weekend on the advice from two business traveler friends.
__label__0 Hackescher Market with it's bars and restaurants is only an 5 minute walk away.
__label__0 not is it a good experience.
__label__0 A buffet is offered in addition to the regular menu.
__label__0 But when you get there it is worth the wait.
__label__0 Couples may feel more comfortable
__label__0 The staff was also very nice.
__label__0 We chose the Mandarin Oriental as we felt to old for South Beach and we were glad we made the right choice.
__label__0 The Pan Pacific is convenient for getting on the bus line and trolley lines.
__label__0 The room decor was a classy, and yet cosy.
__label__0 Only comment I would make - apart from it being all one would expect, is that I nearly slipped twice on the tile floors around the pool
__label__0 They also gave her some vouchers for a couple of free drinks
__label__0 Our room was approximately $100 with tax per night.
__label__0 They have a decent restaurant just off the lobby,
__label__0 The hotel is modern, clean (very) business hotel,
__label__0 The only good thing I would say about this hotel is that the manager had enough sense to call Expedia to assist with getting our reservations changed.
__label__1 there are two lots on either side of the hotel or try the Bon/Macy's parking lot for something a bit cheaper.
__label__0 We have just returned from six nights at the New York Sofitel.
__label__0 and perhaps a little more 'sensitive' than I should be.
__label__0 There are 2 beaches nearby ,10-15min walk, Dukes opposite the Hilton and the lovely Ala Moana beach park on the other side of the Marina.
__label__0 The rooms were nice and the bathrooms were great.
__label__0 but we decided to add a couple of extra days to see Seattle.
__label__0 I even checked in early to secure a room.
__label__0 and the staff were pleasant and helpful.
__label__0 No kids, no loud music and if I had to offer only one morsel, it was that there was no pool side drink service.
__label__0 we feel this is a below average hilton, especially for it's service.
__label__0 The night guy assigned us a new room on the 5th floor.
__label__0 However you can buy there's $$$$.
__label__1 So, we would recommend this property if you are happy with 3-star hotels or lower.
__label__0 This place was just disgusting.
__label__0 I booked a single room - big mistake.
__label__0 Our room was a bay view - all fittings were excellent and my wife revelled in the bath.
__label__0 Nice hotel with good location near the shopping area, subway station, Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church etc. Rooms are quite small, but clean and modern.
__label__0 The entertainment crew did a great job.
__label__0 Very upset with this hotel.
__label__0 Dressing table, and wardrobe all beautifully decorated.
__label__0 The hotel staff is among the best to be found in Hawaii.
__label__0 We did not do the all inclusive meal plan, but I might consider it if we go back because there are not too many places nearby to eat.
__label__0 The resturant serves a good buffet breakfast for around $12 which is well worth it.
__label__1 We had a very pleasant stay and I would highly recommend anyone to stay there.
__label__0 Thank you.
__label__0 It is well located, near Union Square with lots of shops and restaurants nearby.
__label__0 It's not that good for the center attractions and not well connected to public transports.
__label__0 my room has been clean and pleasant,
__label__0 and they were kind enough to take care of them until I returned the next day, ashamed but extremely grateful.
__label__0 Just got back yesterday from Princess Bavaro hotel in Punta Cana and I can tell you that the hotel is beautiful.
__label__0 The resort is either understaffed, poorly managed, or both.
__label__0 I'd have to schlep my bags (and myself) up
__label__0 There are a bunch of treadmills, a couple of cross trainers and a few bikes ,all with individual tv screens attached, and a whole separate area with weight machines.
__label__0 Just stayed night of 14th November 2006, got a very good rate including buffet breakfast from Hotel.com
__label__0 I am very particular about this kind of thing, and have spent a lot of time at other hotels asking to be moved. Not here.
__label__0 The place was a mess
__label__0 It wasn't all bad though.
__label__0 Did not go to the spa but other women in my travel group said it was one of the nicest they had been to.
__label__0 After reading several great reviews about the Moore on tripadvisor, I decided that this might be the best place to stay in Seattle for a great price.
__label__0 Some of the lack of amenities in the $450/night junior suite in which I stayed:No ironing boardNo pants hangersVery few tissues ,a small package of 4,A 1x1 bar of soapNo face washclothsOne English channel on TVNo alarm clockNo secured Wi-Fi and have to get new username/pswd each day
__label__0 Still the design was cool and memorable.
__label__0 The hotel is located right on the trolley line ,with RTA passes available at the front desk, and the ride to campus or downtown is no more than twenty minutes.
__label__0 The bathrooms are very small and have plumbing problems.
__label__0 the second thing, just over the bridge, is the Hotel Antiche Figure, and what a welcome sight
__label__0 I couldn't have wished for a better spot.
__label__0 The room was bigger than we expected after reading the reviews and along with the bathroom was very clean.
__label__0 We reported this incident immediately to guest services at the hotel, but there was no further response from the hotel.
__label__0 We tried to leave our extra card in the outlet slot so the air conditioning would stay on, but it was taken out by the maid and eventually she took it for good.
__label__0 Very glad we experienced New Orleans.
__label__0 while we were out on the street
__label__0 Each of the meats are cooked separately then combined with the veggies and then soy sauce is put on top.
__label__0 A croissant and coffee around the corner was convenient and good at half the price.
__label__0 In other words, if you don't mind the comfort of your bed and if you are a smoker, you will love it!
__label__0 From house-keeping to reception, they were extremely friendly, professional, and concerned for our well-being.
__label__0 The constant explanation was that it was either too windy or too wavy.
__label__0 The breakfast buffet is adequate .
__label__0 The mirrors even made you look better
__label__0 We loved the eastern sector location with it's delightful walking areas and proximity to museum island and gorgeous neo-classical architecture.
__label__0 There are a lot of breakfast options in Waikiki and unfortunately Waikiki Parc doesnt really stand up.
__label__0 Rooms are very spacious
__label__0 The pool, bar area, hammock grove and beach access were great.
__label__0 Our room was compact but exceptionally clean and comfortable.
__label__0 We didnt get the metro once.
__label__0 The Aveda products were also a nice surprise
__label__0 The staff is helpful and pleasant.
__label__0 You cant go wrong.
__label__0 Terrific Boutique Hotel
__label__0 This is normally a pay-to-see commercial attraction separate from the hotel,
__label__0 She did not say anything good about the shop, but simply said they do diving.
__label__1 This hotel is recommended for budget travelers who do not mind to carry on your own luggages to the room and during check out.
__label__0 Didnt want to spend alot of dough and chose the Mosser.
__label__0 The staff were polite and friendly.
__label__0 They did provide me with one when I ask
__label__0 A simple nasi goreng was charged at 95000 rupiah in the hotel, and around 22000 everywhere else.
__label__0 hotel not a disappointment
__label__0 He put together a dinner at Saltys that included a complimentary limo ride to and from the Hilton - a big win for the kids.
__label__0 The kids had stuffed animals and baseball caps on their beds
__label__0 A member of our group was sent by reception to two local dry cleaners shops to get an outfit for that evening ironed before sending her to their hotel accross the street where they had a laundry facility all the time thus wasting an hour and making her late for her evening function.
__label__0 The room we had was small but had enough room for two people ,assuming you arent spending much time in the room,.
__label__0 After a very promising reception, our room was disappointingly small for a hotel of this rating without any views.
__label__0 We too, noticed the sound of the piano player in the evening, but this isn't the worst sound to have wafting into your room!
__label__0 it doesn't have a very clean look.
__label__0 It took forever to check in- only one person at the counter.
__label__0 The room was ok
__label__0 and I cut my foot on a broken drain cover in the whirlpool,
__label__0 The first time was not long after the hotel opened - October last year and the 2nd was only a week ago.
__label__0 Loved the Outrigger
__label__0 This year the food was barely good.
__label__0 We were also told by the front desk that internet access on our laptop was free, but at checkout $11 per day had been added to our bill.
__label__0 All in all, a very good tourist hotel.
__label__0 For the price, I dont think there is a better hotel in downtown Seattle.
__label__0 Palapa Grill Seafood Restaurant - Grilled fish overcooked, dry and fishy.
__label__0 At check in the ask you what drink you want and they get it for you.
__label__0 Right off the bat, ours got so carried away and the salt shaker smashed into my water glass spraying shards in my sushi.
__label__0 I did find the hotel to be a bit over priced for what we got.
__label__0 but the management ended up upgrading me to a corner room (larger room, HDTV, king bed) and didn't charge us.
__label__0 Staff were friendly and helpful and the public areas of the hotel are stunning.
__label__0 The bed was wonderful.
__label__0 This hotel was very clean, large bathroom and the closet space was great too.
__label__0 There is an adequate fitness center, sauna and pool in the basement and a quaint bar/restaurant attached to the hotel.
__label__0 Approx 8/10mins cab ride to the Bogatell beach , this was roughly 9-10euros, worth it as we tried the metro that was a nightmare experience because of the heat.
__label__0 Overall: A beautiful resort with a friendly ,except front desk managers, and hard-working staff.
__label__0 Our disapointment was compounded with the arrival of the bill __�_146 for just 2 courses and wine.
__label__0 We did notice a room next to reception with more tables and a waitress walking in and out with coffee
__label__1 If you have time take the morning trek with lunch.
__label__0 The location is better,safer,cleaner
__label__0 Everything that we needed was within 1 block or 2: bank, coffee shop, pharmacy, great stores  parking.
__label__0 This was my worst hotel stay ever.
__label__0 There was the space for a kingsize bed alright,
__label__0 Even if this is an urban myth, I dont care.
__label__0 food also of a very good standard.
__label__0 The staff were always pleasant polite and we would definately recommend the Holiday Inn Express all over the world and stay there again.
__label__0 Also close to the Mongkok East station which we took the MTR to Shenzhen for a day of shopping.
__label__0 While not on the beach, I think a lot of travellers put too much emphasis on needing to be beachfront in Waikiki.
__label__0 I stayed at the Union Square Hotel for 2 nights in October 2006.
__label__0 The room service was also quite good, and the staff friendly and (for the most part) helpful.
__label__0 but I would take care if staying during the week.
__label__0 Other staff were also unfriendly and short.
__label__0 The living space was quite nice.
__label__0 I was stayed here from the 27th -the 31st of May.
__label__0 Double bed quite narrow and not as comfortable as expected.
__label__1 You have to confirm your reservation
__label__0 I should have posted reviews about the Atlantis Bahamas, Loewes Miami beach, Mina A Salam Dubai, Westin Times Square New York, numerous eastern shangri las.
__label__0 concierge not helpful and very unfriendly.
__label__0 The center took my $50
__label__0 Since we were going to be spending six nights, we moved to another hotel with much bigger rooms,Inn at Harbor Steps, which I highly recommend.
__label__0 We stayed in this hotel for one night in October 2006 and found it to be excellent.
__label__0 (Eating cakes using a plastic credit card is quite ingenious I think!!) I was plagued by mosquitoes and have ended up with 6 nasty,
__label__0 Say hi to the boys at the beach bar
__label__0 The lobby is beautiful and has a luxurious feel, with a loveably staircase,
__label__0 The room initially looked good until closer inspection showed molding coming unglued and loose caulking in the shower.
__label__0 Pike Place etc. We parked the car and walked/took bus/cab all around Seattle.
__label__0 Once we got our keys, we headed off to our section.
__label__0 I felt like I was in their way when checking in and asking questions.
__label__0 They were kind enough to allow us an early check-in.
__label__0 Overall smashing hotel, could it be improved ?
__label__0 and all of the pipes were messed up.
__label__0 The ceiling light fixtures were about a dozen 1970s-era cans (track lighting) set in rows in the ceiling, directed at the bed.
__label__0 This was very noisy indeed, but with the window closed we heard practically nothing.
__label__0 No restaurant and a basic bedroom which was large but a rather dirty and poorly decorated bathroom.
__label__0 We stayed in the tower facing Union St which has been remodeled.
__label__0 All in all if price is an issue stay here.
__label__0 The food comes out all tasting the same - just salty.
__label__0 We were on the 23rd floor with a great view of the Chrysler Building.
__label__0 The staff was amicable
__label__0 The location is great,
__label__0 Firstly location is perfect close to Boston Common and handy for trains , harvard trip a must, and short taxi rides to anywhere else you want to visit.
__label__0 As it was after business hours there was nothing I could do about the important message that needed a timely response.
__label__0 It was too small, the bathroom is tiny, can hardly turn around in it
__label__0 There isnt much in the train station, but there is a Subway restaurant, some sort of coffee shop ,which may be attached to the Subway,, a small gift shop and both Amtrak and Greyhound ticket counters.
__label__0 Something about this hotel though-somehow its quaintand pleasant in an obscene kind of way.
__label__0 Despite the marginal fruit, I will still give this hotel high marks.
__label__0 This was nice since I could see a portion of the race route and could watch roller bladers
__label__0 and the underground or bus often drop you about a half a mile or more from your target destination.
__label__0 I'm a Starwood Platinum Member and they didn't upgrade me!
__label__0 You are safe and there are more than enough shops in the immediate locality for you to have a browse around.
__label__0 unfortunately this hotel is extremely disappointing.
__label__0 while my husband was attending a convention we upgraded to a club room with a desk.
__label__0 Let me start by saying Im a 30 year old guy and Im not one of these people that have never traveled before and then come straight home to write a review about how wonderful there vacation was, because lets face it, first time in the Carribean, how could it be bad?
__label__0 We upgraded to a room with a view of the Gendarmenmarkt for 20 euros a night.
__label__0 You will have to wait in lines to check in and will never see anyone greeting you at the door.
__label__0 I requested a bottle opener
__label__0 The restaurants are beautiful.
__label__0 To the left of the open foyer was the bar.
__label__0 So on the way home I was once more reminded of my vacation stay at the Newport Beachside Resort when I had to be embarassed and use my high intrest credit card to pay for dinner.
__label__0 Very good internet access in the rooms, and wireless in areas of the hotel.
__label__0 The bathroom was very nice, the bath was really big to lie in.
__label__0 Its about $17 for a salad or hamburger and at the restaurants everything is ala carte, ie: $9 for a baked potato.
__label__0 The rooms were big enough, clean and very confortable,
__label__0 Problem #1, the remote control for the television did not work.
__label__0 Great Stay in Downtown Miami
__label__0 Our rooms honestly were a bit smaller then I was expecting but very clean , nice and AC worked great.
__label__0 I was afraid to look under the mattress.
__label__0 The bathroom was very dated  disappointing, in particular I could not believe the shower was in a 5 star hotel.
__label__0 Its a 5 minute walk from union square and getting on trolleys etc, near some bars and restaurants and the staff are really helpful and really friendly.
__label__0 The air-conditioning is not that
__label__0 Overall the vacation was excellent and we are definitely going to come back in the furture
__label__0 Next time when I am in HK I will probably stay in somewhere more central.
__label__0 The main issue we had was that scuba diving was not available all week.
__label__0 If it's for business, I guess this place is alright
__label__0 This is my first time leaving a review.
__label__0 Stayed here for 2 nights.
__label__0 The drinks and the view at the bar on the roof are great, but the sushi was average.
__label__1 We were in a deluxe room ,dont be fooled, these are the basic rooms, which was really small, compared to the fantastic villa we had in Benoa for less then half the price,
__label__0 Thank you to Michelle who is one of the owner of this hotel.
__label__0 We finally arrived around 2 AM as the police never came to the scene.
__label__1 Visiting the convention center - it's less than 10 minutes walk, grab coffee at the French Bakery at Pike's Place before you head into convention hell.
__label__0 The staff is very friendly and speak excellent english.
__label__0 the one almost opposite -called the Meineke I believe, was good, but we also enjoyed the small restaurant, which you would probably mistake for a bar on the same side as the hotel at the top of the street as you head towards the Ku'Damn.
__label__0 I was told we would need to go to the ironing room on the third floor to iron...which felt wierd.
__label__1 New Orleans is a must for every American.
__label__0 The dessert that is served is the same ones that come from the main buffet.
__label__0 The parking is exorbitant, but drivers dont really have a choice.
__label__0 and the rooms are lovely.
__label__0 Water in the shower went from cold to hot and back again.
__label__0 The hotel staff was generally unhelpful.
__label__0 A very large variety of western and Chinese selections.
__label__0 Our stay entitled us to a bottle of champagne on arrival in the room,
__label__0 Definitely not 3 star material to me...
__label__0 We able to reserve one every day.
__label__0 Everything you need right there.
__label__0 I had two options: 1) Leave my car on the street in the middle of the ghetto(which even the front desk was a bad idea) or 2) pay a parking garage $40 a day.
__label__0 Coolest Hotel on the Planet
__label__0 Otherwise, they have nightly entertainment.
__label__0 Stayed here for an overnight while we were in town for a show.
__label__1 This is much safer and far more convenient than hailing taxis from the street.
__label__0 But this hotel was completely renovated in 2004 and remains well maintained.
__label__0 It will improve.
__label__0 First I was told that there was a military rate,
__label__0 The lighting in the bathroom was horrible, it made airplane lightening look good.
__label__0 We walked back to the hotel to check on the other reservations with the evening concierge.
__label__0 The Moore hotel was clean
__label__0 and she did apologize
__label__0 Our room was located on the upper (old) tower floors and in need of updating.
__label__0 I grew up in LA, but now live in a neighboring county.
__label__0 As for the others, the food was okay.
__label__0 The food is great but the service is incredible
__label__0 Who could ask for more?
__label__0 So we are in our new room, no double glazing and god could you here the traffic.
__label__0 A frustrating and depressing experience.
__label__0 He was very apologetic and expressed that this had been a problem for a number of guests that day.
__label__0 Even getting to and from the airport was a breeze.
__label__0 Beautiful on the outside problems on the inside
__label__0 Both of the rooms we were in were lavishly decorated, sparkling clean, with comfortable beds.
__label__0 The FREE parking garage ,YES, FREE, is also secured pretty well.
__label__0 there were no hot breakfast options available, only a few cold meats, plenty of cereal and bread rolls and a handful of cake slices.
__label__0 and this is on a quite street just behind the KaDeWe.
__label__0 but the Andra is about half the price!
__label__0 I took a chance due to our flight getting in a little late.
__label__0 We paid 118 Euro a night for a double room in this hotel and were pleased.
__label__0 The amenities are Aromatherapy Associates of London - smell of lavender and rose - delightful, conditioner is great.
__label__0 Never got the chance to use them though, preferring to spend our limited time on Berlin's many fascinating museums.
__label__0 Suite available so we were upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite.
__label__0 Finally the room.
__label__0 The room was small ,which I expected,, but nicely appointed and very clean.
__label__0 The service wasnt great but it was OK.
__label__0 I was in town on business and stayed at the Westin for just one night.
__label__0 They performed task with a positive attitude.
__label__0 We stayed in the Kalia Tower which is not one better towers but we were thrilled with everything it had to offer
__label__0 You could be in the sun or in the shade.
__label__0 The bed was comfortable, the amenities average.
__label__0 The decor is very early 80s with some nauseating bright green everywhere...
__label__0 Upon further investigation I found out the resort was operating at less than 20% capacity.
__label__0 We called downstairs and they replied Sorry.
__label__0 Johny does an excellent job with Bingo, always drawing plenty of laughs from the audience.
__label__0 Location is great.
__label__0 When I got there it was about noon
__label__0 On both counts the Alsterhof let me down.
__label__0 I thought the water would be more blue but it wasnt.
__label__0 The master bedroom had a king sized bed, walk-in closet, master bath with whirlpool, shower and toilet room.
__label__0 The breakfast was very poor ,the hotel really economized here, and the coffee was very poor.
__label__0 Simply The Best
__label__0 and the location could not be better.
__label__0 Absolutely a feast for the eye when new.
__label__0 The South side of the hotel faces the delivery entrance of the Resort Quest Hotel next door, and during most daylight hours there are trucks making deliveries.
__label__0 We stayed in a non-ocean front room the first night and were bothered by the door slamming and loud neighbors, which we could not hear once we moved to the ocean-front room.
__label__0 But I would start with the hotel staff.
__label__0 We felt sorry for them.
__label__0 and our room got turned down every night and a free bit of chocolate
__label__0 This is perhaps the beat hotel I have visitied in the United States.
__label__0 but never had a problem getting in for late drinks.
__label__0 It was well worth the extra money for the upgrade.
__label__0 It is 5 minutes walk wheeling our bag from Zoo Station, where we came into Berlin from Schoenfeld Airport.
__label__1 Ask for room not facing street.
__label__0 It is located on the street parallel to the canal right behind the central train station.
__label__0 The public areas are very grand especially the lobby with its huge atrium, sweeping staircase and piano player.
__label__0 Almost everything in Germany had English translations, but not the machines there.
__label__0 We will definately stay there again.
__label__0 The bathroom was huge, spotless and beautiful
__label__0 The staff was so friendly and helpful, and our room was above average, considering the norm for hotels in Europe.
__label__0 I loved this hotel and would recommend it to anyone.
__label__0 Staff was friendly although I often had trouble finding someone at the Concierge desk.
__label__0 Stayed at the 5 Star Hilton Berlin for two nights to experience the Christmas Markets and celebrate my friends birthday.
__label__0 The rooms are quite small, ,although not all the same size for doubles,, and the room was clean.
__label__0 I didn't have any bottled water left in the fridge in my room
__label__1 On your way in, grab one of the oodles of people checking out and get their advice.
__label__0 The breakfast was good - cake, bread, cereal, OJ and coffees.
__label__0 The bedding did not fit the bed
__label__0 They moved us to another room, this room extremely hot....and the air conditioner did not work.
__label__0 Boutique Gem in Waikiki Beach
__label__0 Also, many snack places if you like street food.
__label__0 The Trader Vic's puts our Trader Vic's here in Emeryville to shame, both with respect to decor and food quality.
__label__0 but we didn't find anything particularly special about it.
__label__0 I found the place to be quite clean.
__label__0 A lot of families and couples.
__label__0 and I had to wait until after 2:30 to check in
__label__0 It still can be a charming city again and I am sure that new developments ,I saw a big TRUMP banner on the cab ride over, will help.
__label__0 Overall, we enjoyed our stay,
__label__0 Instead I was in for 8 international calls to the hotel
__label__0 Pros: location, clean large room.
__label__0 It didn't come, so I then had to leave the hotel, walk to a restaurant up the street, where they sold me some bottled water, that I brought back to my room.
__label__0 Good value
__label__0 My bed was supposed to be a king
__label__0 The place is beautifully decorated
__label__0 It was the worse stay we had ever had at a hotel.
__label__0 the service was great the only mistake was one day the room was not clean when I returned that afternoon
__label__0 but the confirmation email I received only contained the confirmation #, not the price, so we have been fighting this for 7 days now.
__label__0 It is with quiet nice, courteous staff, and clean rooms.
__label__0 You can have breakfast and Drinks if you do it yourself and buy the ingredients.
__label__0 friendly, good value
__label__1 If you must stay here check out the room first before you hand over your credit card.
__label__0 I dont see the point in this.
__label__0 The room was beautiful, though small, and everything was neat and clean.
__label__0 The first few days we spent at the Alexis which was absolutely gorgeous.
__label__0 Location in downtown Waikiki cant be beat.
__label__0 We decided to go back and urgue our case.
__label__0 The hotel itself was interesting since it is round, the staff were polite but the hotel itself is understaffed.
__label__0 They are not up to the international standards.
__label__0 Definitely the way to go if youre staying here
__label__0 The only downside , or upside depending on how you look at it, is: This isnt a trendy hotel, like some in Dallas.
__label__0 Stayed here between 13th Oct and 17th Oct.
__label__0 and they had a bunch of baby supplies for us that were helpful.
__label__0 The maids shouldn't be anywhere near that room until we have cleared check-out.
__label__0 However, this resort was highly unorganized and for a 6 GOLDEN Apple rating, we would surely cringe to see a 4-star ratied resort, which must be a sewer with 3 people working per every 1,000 tourists.
__label__0 Not to be age pregidous but, didnt see anyone here that was older 60+ like other hotels in the immediate area as this one.
__label__0 Just stayed 2 nights recently, hardly stayed in the room as we walked all around the Old and New French Quarter area.
__label__0 We asked the concierge if she had a map of Reagan Airports layout and she replied no.
__label__0 you have been given a discount special!
__label__0 Not sure about that - take a trip to Yokohamas Chinatown - but it is very good if youre feeling lazy and cant be bothered to venture out of the hotel.
__label__0 It is billed as being a small luxury hotel but really didn't see it as being any different other than decor.
__label__1 I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone I liked.
__label__0 Nice but not for western tourists.
__label__0 The location was excellent, 5min cab journey to Las Ramblas, which was approx 6-7 euros.
__label__0 A turn down service also added a little more luxury.
__label__0 wonderful wedding my husband and i had planned to get married abroad.
__label__0 The shower also had no curtain, but rather a limited glass door.
__label__0 They ended up giving us two smaller rooms instead,
__label__0 Although some parts of the hotel are OK,
__label__0 One side of the room is all window with a patio window...
__label__0 I believe the hotel is best for business clientle.
__label__0 he was extremely rude and would not hear our issue.
__label__0 Very comfortable bed with a variety of pillows.
__label__0 The coffee in the room of course was great (this being Seattle).
__label__0 The MOORE is good for the money, but NOT in summer.
__label__0 We stayed with a park n fly rate.
__label__0 lots of fresh fruit salads and juices plus all the Jamon and olives you can eat.
__label__0 Rooms very large with big bathrooms and a walk-in shower (unusual in European Hotels).
__label__0 We heard music up until 3 or 4am both nights of our stay, but it really didnt keep us from sleeping.
__label__0 The housecleaning staff was very attentive and always turned down the room before we got back in the evenings.
__label__0 The hotel is older,
__label__0 I really didnt get a chance to experience the staffs level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom.
__label__0 The conference facilities were drafty
__label__0 Also you could feel the springs digging into your back all night long.
__label__0 Anyone with allergies to mold, I would stay away from this resort.
__label__0 Good location for shopping.
__label__0 I would trust these people,
__label__0 Most disturbingly, the room reeked of mildew and the linens seemed old and tired, long overdue for replacement.
__label__0 Just across the street is a ChesseCake Factory which is a much better deal for nearly the same quality of food.
__label__0 From 8 o' clock on it was just a banging of doors and throwing things around in the hallway.
__label__0 Its old and any improvements/repairs all look completely half baked.
__label__0 Very convienent to everything.
__label__0 no chance for me I'm afraid, the traffic noise was just to great, even with plugs!!
__label__0 Its also become kind of a fun joke that we still mention.
__label__0 Call us cheap, but we said no thanks and parked on the street for free since it was after 6pm.
__label__0 everything looks as if it wasn___t replaced or repaired the last 40 years
__label__0 It also offers a small store where supplies at modest prices.
__label__0 However, we would not call this a five star hotel.
__label__0 Cost 5euro.
__label__0 and they should send the staff on a training course in customer relations.
__label__0 Very easy to walk to restaurants, even to walk to North Beach.
__label__0 Pike Place is less than a 10 minute walk from the Westin and is definitely a must see.
__label__0 I struck gold with the Hotel Lungarno.
__label__0 and it was disappointing to end our trip in a place that was so sterile and impersonal.
__label__0 The TV was very small and not at all modern,
__label__0 loved the royal hotel is in excellent location on
__label__0 Went a long way.
__label__0 Thanks for our ruined Aniversary Seattle Sheraton.
__label__0 but you have to wait quite a long time to get seated in this small and crowded breakfast room.
__label__0 So we enjoyed 3 excellent meals, however only one of them was at one of the promised alla carte restaurants.
__label__0 I think the name was Central Market.
__label__0 Tha hotel is well located from Esperanza, the beach and the restaurants.
__label__0 We travelled all over the world and had never such a bad experience.
__label__0 If I were coming to Berlin again, I would probably find a hotel nearer the Brandenburg Gate so its more central to all sites and would be happy to pay a bit more
__label__0 Location was great.
__label__0 We were able to check-in at 10:30am when we arrived and later in the afternoon received our complimentary snack and drink.
__label__0 During our 3 night stay in Warwick, we changed 3 rooms.
__label__0 I had made two reservations: one for the first part of our trip and one for the third leg (after Olympic Penninsula) but decided to cancel the second reservation.
__label__0 The staff was so nice and helpful, they really added to our wonderful week in Seattle.
__label__0 We changed to a nonsmoking 7th floor room the next day, which thankfully was more updated.
__label__0 Thus in order to take a ride in the elevator up through the middle of the huge cylindrical aquarium you must pay an entrance fee to the Aqua Dom which is expensive.
__label__0 and that they were able to hold our luggage in a securely locked room after we checked out.
__label__0 They do have a room for storing luggage
__label__0 Rh.
__label__0 As far as cleanliness, it was just okay - it's the kind of place that makes you feel as
__label__0 Check in time was at 3:00 P.M. and we couldn't get into our room until 6:00 P.M. because "it wasn't ready."
__label__1 Especially good for shopping on the Kurfustendamm...bring an extra bag!!
__label__0 and it is not ideal to be given the option of breakfast in the reception atrium while being gawped at by tourists along with the fish!
__label__0 The hotel is about 5 minutes walk from the famous bombed out church and the start of the K'dam,
__label__0 Stayed at the hotel over Easter 2005.
__label__0 Clean, fast and efficient a pleasure to use, journey time into central/ causeway bay 10 mins max.
__label__0 The location is ok but the hotel like a motel 6 at best.
__label__0 We stood and waited (being British we queued of course!!!)
__label__0 but the location could be right oppposite a building site or miles from the nearest bars and restaurants, or just in the wrong part of town.
__label__0 and the room was small.
__label__0 We booked the city tour thru her ,she did all the calling, and she helped us reserve tickets for Alcatraz.
__label__0 The post before mine is NOT about the Melia Tropical, another resort entirely.
__label__0 I had contacted Henry regarding the hotel using his email address found in other reviews on this site.
__label__0 and the room was very clean.
__label__0 You are NOT allowed to help yourself to the cutlery so we had to wait for that.
__label__0 We stayed in one of the renovated rooms after recommendation from Tripadvisor.
__label__0 But the hotel did not fulfill my wishes, which where a quiet room and a bathtub in the bathroom.
__label__0 The Staff was great and so was the service.
__label__0 I insisted on changing rooms and was eventually given a room on the executive floor.
__label__0 Housekeeping was quick to make up the room each day that I was there and were very friendly when I saw them in the halls.
__label__0 I do not find a large fish tank sufficient reason to go back
__label__0 I didnt have time to really research and simply booked whatever Priceline would honor.
__label__0 My sister who is a picky eater found the food to be good.
__label__0 there was one pump in the shower that was a body and/or shampoo.
__label__0 Maybe I just thought Seattle would be a little friendlier given the great reputation they have as being such a liveable place.
__label__0 As a single female traveler, I could walk around and feel relatively safe
__label__0 The location was perfect--easy to get to all venues, close to the Canal bus stop, around the corner from the Anne Frank House ,go after 7 pm if you can--no line,
__label__0 - Boeing : 45 min busride, 1 hall with poor pieces, 2 videos, 1 was really poor, busride to the factory.
__label__0 The bill was still $20.Desk staff: Well -- After being notified by phone message at 5:00p.
__label__0 Also, the food at the nearby Cafe de Tacuba is excellent.
__label__0 The hotel in it self is quite ok, little run down but nice people and good service.
__label__0 I have just returned from a five night stay in the hotel.
__label__0 Bathroom is basic including a shower cubicle (complete with a large damp patch in the corner).
__label__0 The activity desk was very knowledgeable about the activities that you can do.
__label__0 If it wasnt  so late at night and if I was staying more than one night I would have left.
__label__0 The French Quarter is now full of people getting married by some Dr. Jerry in New Orleans.
__label__0 There is no turndown service as well.
__label__0 You had to either swim up or walk up to get served.
__label__0 Beautiful large rooms with a separate sitting area and desk.
__label__0 What a major disappointment.
__label__0 If I didnt want to go out and see the city so much I would have just layed about in them all day they were that comfortable.
__label__0 but you should be out enjoying the city anyways.
__label__0 Parking was a joke at $26.00 per nite.
__label__0 We had a jacuzzi in the room with a king sized bed and we were 10 steps away from the beach
__label__0 I cannot stop the hot water coming out from the machine.
__label__0 We stayed here for 1 night in August
__label__0 The better hotels should take notice Mosser, Great job
__label__0 The downstairs bar looked really nice.
__label__0 The staff were very polite, friendly and couldnt do enough for you.
__label__0 Fine dining Restaurants like Benihanna, Golden Dragon ,chinese,, Sergios ,Italian,, as well as Regular eating places like pizzerias, delis, hot dog stands.
__label__0 The room is the best feature - clean and spacious.
__label__0 Just returned from a Great 3 night stay at the Westin on a fantastic priceline deal.
__label__0 I'lll see what they do about it.
__label__0 The hotel is located centrally
__label__0 The rooms are so old fashioned, stinky and noisy.
__label__0 Extremely friendly and very helpful staff.
__label__0 The grounds were beatiful and at night the ground lighting created a romantic effect in the landscaping.
__label__0 In fact I could care less.
__label__0 The waiter seemed not too bothered.
__label__0 However, it was not spectacular for a few reasons.
__label__0 Never heard any of the other occupants, great bathroom and toiletries, fantastic amenities for guests in the lobby (including a great coffee/breakfast-to-go/sandwich place with rockin' breakfast sandwiches at affordable prices) and lots of computers, lots of staff, great bellmen...... but at a normal price of about $350 per room a night, an extra $40 for parking doesn't leave you with a great taste in your mouth....
__label__0 The only thing I did not like was the absence of an iron in the room.
__label__1 Dont miss the nearby Palace Kitchen Restaurant and the doughnut shop that are on 5th Avenue.
__label__0 We honeymooned in Hawaii for two weeks the first being at the Hilton Hawaiin Village Resort.
__label__0 So for most people who are not social anxiety-prone this would not be a problem but instead a plus.
__label__0 Hardly 4-star I stayed at this hotel while on a business trip.
__label__0 I did not like the red or white wines.
__label__0 Overall the stay was just above neutral.
__label__0 Housecleaning was fantastic
__label__0 She found a place called Teds IN Buffalo that she could get me into.
__label__0 We final wrote a note on the door but they did not speak english to read it.
__label__0 Enjoy.
__label__0 0
__label__0 The only lapse in the otherwise excellent service was at breakfast the following morning.
__label__0 I was travelling with my husband and step son age 14.
__label__0 Twin room means two double beds.
__label__0 Pretty much faultless, we loved it.
__label__1 Avoid this hotel!
__label__0 I really enjoyed watching the documentary on the hotel tv channel about the history of the St Francis- fascinating
__label__0 The room was 4-star, but the lack of services ,e.g. pool, gift shop, make the entire property a 3.5 star.
__label__0 They charged us more than the quoted price,
__label__0 All roads lead to the Duomo, it is hard to escape its gravity.
__label__0 The suite was beautifully decorated with a sort of Island Pottery Barn look.
__label__0 All in all a pleasant stay.
__label__0 PS. the breakfast is good
__label__1 would recommend.
__label__0 Check-in was quick and very easy.
__label__0 Often we seated ourselves after waiting, waiting, and waiting some more--WITH A RESERVATION.
__label__0 Staff seemed pleasant but not very proactive in resolving problems.
__label__0 We spent New Years Eve in this wonderful Hotel.
__label__0 Among the finest hotels in Paris -- and the world.
__label__0 Rooms: Really nice.
__label__0 I would have no hesitation in returning to this hotel.
__label__0 Used to stay at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel and Towers but when the rates when up found the Radisson online and it is right around the corner from the Boston Park Plaza.
__label__0 Overall, if you have money to burn and are looking for a staff to challenge your patience,
__label__0 Marie celeste hotel
__label__0 Arrived at 8 promptly.
__label__0 We finally got someone to come turn it off about 2:30 AM.
__label__0 (all of them)...
__label__0 I also enjoyed the Japanese where the cook prepared the food in front of you and does a little show off routine.
__label__0 Walls were a bit thin, but we didnt have any major issues.
__label__0 When I arrived to the hotel I was very sick and he send medicine to my room as well as room service.
__label__0 One bellhop guy almost ran over some kids who were standing with their parents in the lobby waiting to check in,
__label__0 I am not particularly drawn to trendy.
__label__1 For the money I recommend this because of it position and has all the things needed.
__label__0 $85 + parking was better than I was expecting.
__label__0 We will be staying at the Windsor Court every time we return to New Orleans.
__label__0 My husband and two children ages 8 and 5 all loved our stay at the Ritz Carlton.
__label__1 Other than the frozen drinks, I would not reccommend a mixed drink here.
__label__0 Seattle Sheraton listed as a 4 Star, Beware not even close, maybe a 2 if that.
__label__1 Give this place a go - just catch up on sleepbefore you do.
__label__0 Easter holidays and all I can say is that the place was great.
__label__0 There were mini crab cakes, shrimp and a big pot of gumbo.
__label__0 So we returned to our stuffy, airless OR very noisy room.
__label__0 He is an amazing source of information.
__label__0 The only other detractor was the bar - off to one side of reception and seemed like a last minute thought - slick service and a list of over 200 martini - we were sorry we didnt stay long enough to try them all.
__label__1 I would not suggest doing this without fins unless you are VERY strong swimmer and even take caution with fins if you are a strong swimmer.
__label__0 The hotel staff were very courteous
__label__0 The towels were thin and scratchy;
__label__0 We loved the location of the hotel and would stay there again!
__label__1 Just make sure you stay in the remodeled section.
__label__0 We were told that other hotels in the French Quarter charge roughly the same price.
__label__0 I spent four nights at Diamond Palace Hotel while attending a conference in San Juan.
__label__0 and other rooms for those that pay the rack rate.
__label__0 We upgraded directly with the hotel.
__label__0 Stayed in a standard room - clean,quiet and very comfortable.
__label__0 My problems werent with the city. 
__label__0 The door of the cigar bar on the ground floor is left open
__label__0 They nickel and dime you though.
__label__1 This is not a hotel I can recommend for any type of group.
__label__0 This gave us access to a great continental breakfast and evening munchies.
__label__0 Also after flying from Montreal we had to wait 20 minutes to be picked up and after returning to the hotel had a wait another 15 minutes to get the car back and we were the only ones there at the time.
__label__0 I am not sure the Villa Kennedy can be topped.
__label__0 Not a bad meal was to be had in any restaurant.
__label__0 I got a $20 certificate for the inconvenience.
__label__0 and they left me on hold twice and couldn't get a manager to the phone.
__label__0 The rate fluctuated with each phone call and I made 3 of them.
__label__0 only down side is no air conditioning, but open the windows its ok.
__label__0 A cigar bar off the lobby worried us until we discovered it did not offend our non-smoking sensibilities.
__label__0 Overall, its a dark, dated hotel let down badly by the unhelpful and rude staff.
__label__0 You are next to the Berlin Dom, the sea life center and the spree river.
__label__0 Spent 3 nights at St Marie in Dec 2003.
__label__1 If youre in the mood to splurge, the Royal Hawaiian ,pink hotel, has a great breakfast but it is pricey.
__label__0 When I saw that on the bar menu the second night, I asked the bartender.
__label__0 We booked a non-smoking room and found that we had been allocated a smoking room of very inferior quality but managed to change to a vastly superior room the next day by the skin of our teeth.
__label__0 I shrugged my shoulders and said why not.
__label__0 Pluses: Theres a little market across the street that was well-stocked, lots of wine, chips, etc.
__label__0 Everything is close.
__label__0 The Lasagna Ristorante on 8th is very good as well.
__label__1 If you have any questions just e-mail me: Jillanson@excite.com
__label__1 One word of caution - drink lots of bottled water and watch the food preparation, making sure your food has been cooked all the way.
__label__0 As I said earlier, she offered to, take care of me, the next time I visited Miami.
__label__0 Old San Juan was a $15 cab ride away.
__label__0 The rooms were slightly outdated, with stripy coloured wall-paper, and country style curtains.
__label__0 I stayed at the Sheraton this time primarily due to an internet price offer and the 4 star rating of the hotel.
__label__0 Asked for another mattress because it was like you are sleeping on a stone.
__label__0 Well, all we saw of the ocean was the roof top of another building.
__label__0 I am only six foot one, so not overly tall, but my feet were always hanging over the end of the bed which is uncomfortable.
__label__0 Upon arrival, checked in went up to the room and was very dissappointed.
__label__0 We just returned from a nice visit to the Copamarina last week.
__label__0 The room we stayed in was large and airy and i loved coming back to the room each night to find the bed turned down and two mini toblerones on each pillow.
__label__0 Had been warned of a noiseless facelift but was unprepared to battle my way through a foyer of painters
__label__0 Situated in a section of Madrid east of the Retiro park, you could be anywhere where high rise buildings predominate.
__label__0 Also, for breakfast, the food was OK but there were no English Muffins, minimal pastries and cereals and just not a big selection.
__label__1 I most warn everybody to avoid this hotel.
__label__0 Very cold reception, couldn't answer a few simple questions for directions to a few of the sights or an ATM.
__label__0 Relocated to Ohana East This property is now a part of the Ohana and Outrigger family of hotels.
__label__0 Free Internet is also provided which is great.
__label__0 On two separate occasions we asked for the so-called complimentary transportation.
__label__0 Rooms are very basic to say the least,
__label__0 nice and the staff was very friendly.
__label__0 The hotel is close to all the major attractions.
__label__0 and he took our luggage.
__label__0 When we saw our room, we were not pleased.
__label__1 Please read this before before booking your break away in this hotel.
__label__0 I tried ordering something from their menu and gave up after repeating my order four times ,I was at the bar 10 minutes,.
__label__0 and it has the unfortunate disadvantage of constantly crowding the lobby with passing pedestrians having a free look from the hotel side.
__label__0 Arrived early and left my luggage at reception.
__label__0 In my opinion it was a great deal.
__label__0 The room was very clean and nicely decorated.
__label__0 I paid 100 Euros for this reservation and upon arrival upgraded to a junior suite for additional 100 Euro.
__label__0 you can order something and go down to pick it up and take back to your room.
__label__0 Yes indeed
__label__0 It is located conveniently close to public transportation and we have always been given good directions at the front desk.
__label__0 I haven't stayed at too many nicer hotels.
__label__0 The teenagers, on the other hand, were happy, and ate at the Crocodile down the street,
__label__1 This hotel is good if you are just looking to catch some sleep
__label__0 And once again we ended up with the Sheraton.
__label__0 Really good location.
__label__0 but it has progressively gone down hill in my opinion.
__label__0 Second of all, we were taken back by the strong smell of pine sol when we entered our room.
__label__0 Any hotel can have problems, and we ran into a few, but the night manager Shieshedo gave new meaning to the word hospitality
__label__0 Then, the display returns the number/letter of the car which will take you to your floor.
__label__0 They are beautiful and spacious, but have hardwood floors, causing the sound to travel easily from one room to the next.
__label__0 and the heater noise was minimal.
__label__1 Remember to buy water from the supermarket near Madame Tussauds, much cheaper than anywhere else.
__label__0 One of the most beautiful I have ever seen...
__label__0 During the day they also have activities you can participate in led by the animation team.
__label__0 Efficient, No frills
__label__0 The rooms are spacious
__label__0 After reading the reviews everyday up until the time I left, I was very nervous about staying here.
__label__0 There's a fantastic deli across the street where we purchased breakfast for four for half the price of a single continental breakfast at the hotel.
__label__0 Check In is at 3 PM, however, we arrived at 10 AM and got our room right away
__label__0 and I asked where the pool is located to be told the pool is closed for remodeling until September or October.
__label__0 Luckily that was my last night at the A-Train.
__label__0 We were a little baffled, as the light repair on the desk had been attended to, anyway we enjoyed the chocolates, but ,later in the evening as we turned on the television we realized that the television had been replaced with a flat screen model.
__label__0 I am wondering if we were being punished for complaining.
__label__0 The brochure advertises that windsurfing, kayaking, and sailing are included.
__label__0 and I felt like I wasted them on this hotel.
__label__0 You almost never see anyone else ,apart from your butler who constantly comes to your door - even entering once without knocking,,
__label__0 Lots of shopping around, places to eat, and close to Pike's Market.
__label__0 TAKE A PORTABLE FAN.
__label__0 and I had to sleep with earplugs.
__label__0 One of the lamps over the sink had blown
__label__0 The place was old and dirty, more like a 2 star hotel with dirty sheets and carpet.
__label__0 Flat screen TV, dvd and stereo.
__label__0 The room was great with a modern updated decor.
__label__0 And yup, parking is expensive everywhere in SEA.
__label__0 Our room was down a long corridor with three dead lightbulbs, which we pointed out but were not replaced during our stay.
__label__0 Decore was nice and clean, beds comfortable and we did have a fridge.
__label__0 Three other couples travelled with us and everyone found the hotel enchanting - and the price modest.
__label__0 The Reichstag Dome, TV Tower at Alexanderplatz, and Pergamon Museum are all worth a visit.
__label__0 Had a room on 9th floor overlooking Coit Tower and the Bay.
__label__0 and at least one more I saw elsewhere - there access costs 1 Euro for an hour!
__label__0 Follow the collection of bikes down to this beautiful area by the lake.
__label__1 Beware - If paying the buffet breakfast was poor value, Ok for cereals and fruit,poor quality cooked breakfast.
__label__0 When we mentioned our room hadn't been cleaned one day they simply dumped clean towels in the room and didn't even tidy up!
__label__0 Hotel itself is very impressive.
__label__0 We we allocated room 5088 which looked over an internal courtyard so very quiet but no view.
__label__0 The service at the hotel was reasonable,
__label__0 This hotel was the only one in our price range that would guarantee separate beds.
__label__0 but there were no annoying noise, at least to our ears.
__label__0 The food was expensive in the hotel.
__label__1 Go to a game, too.
__label__0 Service was okay but not quite the same as a Grand Hyatt or similar.
__label__0 Stow your bathing suit in your carryon, so you can sit by the pool when you arrive.
__label__0 We do not mind it either.
__label__0 As for the bathroom well what can we say.
__label__0 I generally stay at the Sheraton because I liked the rooms
__label__0 Beach Absolutely beautiful
__label__0 Nor would I generally spend over 300 Euros for a hotel (thankfully my Mom was paying for this stay).
__label__0 The worst thing was the beds were so small,
__label__0 all these things, and many more, make it a relaxing haven to return to after a hot, busy days sightseeing, and all so conveniently close.
__label__0 The front desk staff was very helpful and very welcoming, to us and to our standard poodle.
__label__0 Lots of good eating places.
__label__0 Plenty of eating places with varied prices all around.
__label__0 Not so: it is 5 long city blocks away.
__label__0 After seeing a large renovated suite in this hotel, we booked months ahead so our daughter
__label__1 But given the price I would recommend this one unreservedly.
__label__0 ADEQUATE MOSQUITO REPELLANT.
__label__0 Overall, we were very pleased with the hotel for the price we paid.
__label__0 If you get a deluxe room (yes, you are right: deluxe room) you will hate this hotel.
__label__0 None of these Hilton entities have had the courtesy of even responding (no less reversing this charge) in over a week.
__label__0 Parking was $35 a day
__label__0 We will definitely stay at the Pan Pacific again.
__label__0 There are restaurants nearby, and plently of shopping.
__label__0 None of the special touches I am used to a hotel of this rating (I had to ask for toiletries because I had forgotton my shampoo but this is something I normally don't need to concern myself with in a 4 star hotel).
__label__0 We are usually Westin or W people, but decided to check out one of the new rooms here.
__label__0 The only winners are part of the gang themselves 
__label__0 We were supposed to be on the club floor, but had been moved to the union tower as we arrived after midnight I wasnt in the mood to make a fuss.
__label__0 The service lady who managed the area did a great job of keeping it clean and prepped.
__label__0 The following morning I was up at 5.30 am and wanted a coffee once again this was not available until 6am, WHY ?
__label__0 We would not book in summer.
__label__1 The room was fine, but be forewarned, the neighboring Hilton is building a high-rise time share building right next to the Ilikai , Diamond Head side.
__label__0 Some previous reviewers complained about the smoke released from the Cigar bar.
__label__1 and in my oppinion a hostel would be better than wasting your money on a somewhat dodgy three stars.
__label__0 Seriously.
__label__0 Great resort
__label__0 You can reach any part of the city, yet you are far enough away from the hussle and bussle of La Rambla.
__label__0 I guess we could have driven the 30 minutes and tried to find out more about the dive shop, but we had been stuck in horrible traffic in San Juan for 3 hours and simply did not want to get back in the car.
__label__0 We liked this hotel - it is not far from La Rambla and is just across the road from the Metro - Universitat stop.
__label__0 Food was great, pool is awesome.
__label__0 ,2, it is clean and very modern in decor.
__label__0 Awesome Experience
__label__0 though but hot breakfasts are more to my liking.
__label__0 Pet Friendly Find in SF
__label__0 OK in the Oceanfront Rooms
__label__0 Would i stay again?
__label__0 Give me a break.
__label__0 From the front desk staff to the bellmen to the housekeepers --- we felt like we were among Ohana ,Hawaiian for family,.
__label__0 Finally, the manager offered me $50 off my bill.
__label__0 The main bar was enjoyable and the bartenders gave good service while a lady sang spanish songs, enjoyed that very much and tasted a bit of the national culture talking to locals and watching them dance but this was the only nightlife the hotel offered since they have no live bands or dance club.
__label__0 If we were to go back to the Dominican I think we would stay there agin.
__label__0 Great view of the river.
__label__0 It also lists as a boutique hotel which is to make it sound quaint, I guess.
__label__0 A few went on the ATVs and loved it, but a bit more dangerous.
__label__0 I slept like a baby and am extremely particular about bedding.
__label__1 Do not take the Raymond Hudd suite unless you take both of them
__label__0 and didn't even have a wardrobe,
__label__0 If you want a quiet Hotel near tourist sites, this is for you.
__label__0 This room was facing the street
__label__0 The hotel restaurants looked nice,
__label__0 For those concerned about the neighborhood- its SF, get over panhandlers.
__label__0 My only minuses were the bed was a little hard (but still comfy) and the additional fees for the little things...which is typical of the hotels in Seattle anyway.
__label__0 The rooms are very nice and clean.
__label__0 The staff were great, accomodated for everything we wanted.
__label__0 I stayed here regularly for work for about 2 months this year.
__label__0 No clock radio was provided which meant you had to rely on the facilities provided with the TV
__label__0 Unfortunately, I don't think there is a quiet side of the hotel.
__label__0 Lunch at the Beach buffet was OK.
__label__0 Unfortunately, we were not very pleased.
__label__0 On the third day I tackled them again about the problem .
__label__0 This hotel definitely has a hostel-feel to it.
__label__0 though I did find the concierge to be particularly unhelpful.
__label__0 ++++
