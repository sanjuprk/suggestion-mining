__label__0 Very very unfortunate for us that Park Inn was fully booked
__label__0 room was attractive, clean, adequate size and very quiet even though faced on La rambla. restaurant was convenient and good for all meals though lots of small restaurants in area provideding easy access for meals.
__label__0 Im an HHonors member so stay in Hiltons all over, but this is my favorite.
__label__0 The hop on hop off tour buses also stop nearby so for us the location was ideal.
__label__0 It was a sportsbar type place
__label__0 The construction noise was VERY loud.
__label__0 Last time they asked for my drivers license.
__label__1 You can rent innertubes or floats ,about $10 for the day each,.
__label__0 Maybe I just thought Seattle would be a little friendlier given the great reputation they have as being such a liveable place.
__label__0 I will not be returning.
__label__1 Alcohol was top shelf - try a vodka lime juice
__label__0 Tee hee hee)2. Terrible smell of sewers down the corridors of hotel although, thankfully not in our room.
__label__0 The hotel has floor-to-ceiling single glazed windows and even on the 8th floor,
__label__0 The main staff of the hotel were all very nice
__label__0 Excellent family-run hotel
__label__0 Our room was very clean.
__label__0 I had the doughnuts!!!
__label__0 After reading the reviews everyday up until the time I left, I was very nervous about staying here.
__label__0 We always managed to find something and even if it was in the sun, we would take a beak in the shade by sitting on the comfy cushioned chairs sofas that rim the buffet restaurant.
__label__0 We travel on a budget and were lucky to get 2 nights at a discount rate
__label__0 The redeeming point was the hotel's location which was superb.
__label__0 We had an appointment to which we were late,
__label__1 Bottom line, if internet access is a factor, stay elsewhere.
__label__0 So it was kind of easy to accidentally spill some water on the floor (not to mention slip and break your neck).
__label__0 They charged the wrong girl, this time.
__label__0 Would I stay there again -- Maybe.
__label__0 We enjoyed our vacation, but we have stayed at several Gran Bahia hotels befor and found it allitle blaw as we knew what to expect.
__label__0 Bathroom is average looking too, with mold smell.
__label__0 The staff were very helpful and always polite.
__label__0 The room was clean, but nothing special.
__label__0 True, the location is very convenient to the central shopping district and the staff are mostly courteous.
__label__0 The hotel was briefed ahead of time that we would be spending our honeymoon with them.
__label__0 The location is perfect and close to everything Boston has to offer.
__label__0 After 1 night, the mildew was aggravating my allergies, so i asked to be switched to a different room.
__label__0 Alternatively it's around __ï¿½_8 in a taxi.
__label__0 Refills were offered twice during our entire stay in the main dining room.
__label__1 If you want to soak in the hot-tub or swim in the pool at the end of a long day look for other accommodations.
__label__0 I didnt find it quite so fantastic as some of the reviews i read.
__label__0 Our room was a bay view - all fittings were excellent and my wife revelled in the bath.
__label__0 the only instruction given was to turn right outside door and straight down.
__label__1 Dont go crazy worrying about fancy evening wear, pack as little as possible and bring a clip for the hair.
__label__0 Fish shouldnt smell fishy or like garbage.
__label__0 The public areas are very grand especially the lobby with its huge atrium, sweeping staircase and piano player.
__label__0 Each of the meats are cooked separately then combined with the veggies and then soy sauce is put on top.
__label__0 The schizophrenic state starts as you begin walking to your room, what an awful smell in the corridor.
__label__0 You can reach any part of the city, yet you are far enough away from the hussle and bussle of La Rambla.
__label__1 Go to a game, too.
__label__0 I was hungry for a bit more than that and ordered eggs and sausage.
__label__0 Minimalist modern rooms; motorized blinds, glass bathroom, flat screen TV.
__label__0 Efficient, No frills
__label__0 I stayed for two periods - the first I was upgraded to a suite which was beautifully furnished, clean and except for some electrical problems with operating the Jacuzi, was well above the standard I expected.
__label__0 It is nicely decorated, clean and comfortable and the staff were extremely polite and helpful.
__label__0 In fact I could care less.
__label__0 The breakfast selection was terrific and of course the dinner was fabulous.
__label__0 Twin room means two double beds.
__label__0 The bedding situation consisted of two twin size beds that we tried to put together but, one was higher than the other, some way to consummate a marriage?
__label__0 The entire suite was impeccably clean.
__label__0 Overall, the room was worth the price.
__label__0 For us it was a week in hell.
__label__0 we were constantly nickel-and-dimed.
__label__0 The bar and lobby area is great for kicking back - quite small
__label__0 We looked around at some alternatives but we reckon this is the best value hotel on the beach front and cannot recommend it highly enough.
__label__0 When we went the back the unhelpful receptionist's told us that in fact we were expected there and not the sister hotel, we should never have been sent away.
__label__0 Yes, the room is small.
__label__0 The staff is very friendly and speak excellent english.
__label__0 Kind of small, bad furnished and without any air-conditioning.
__label__0 Otherwise, they have nightly entertainment.
__label__0 Its only 60-80 HKD to the Wan Chai bars and central.
__label__0 The only reason I give a 4/5 stars is the ridiculous parking cost.
__label__0 Im not saying this isnt a good hotel for the price and location, but I would look around before I would stay here again.
__label__0 Hector at the front desk was great.
__label__0 I was told we would need to go to the ironing room on the third floor to iron...which felt wierd.
__label__0 They don't realize the power of Trip adviser!
__label__0 I stayed in this Novotel because 1- it is relatively cheap, 2 - of the brand Novotel.
__label__0 Location is not bustling - but it is close to everything.
__label__0 When I exited the room, she appeared to be entering the room to clean, but when I returned at 2:30pm the room was still in the same condition which made me angry because I had returned to the room to rest.
__label__0 I was in town on business and stayed at the Westin for just one night.
__label__0 also 5 minutes walk is Ka De We which is the 2nd the biggest department store in Europe after Harrods.
__label__0 Super Clean
__label__0 Out of all the associates I encountered, only two- a female security guard and the aforementioned bartender, were nice.
__label__0 Waiters friendly but 70% spoke no english and was sometimes difficult to get the right thing.
__label__0 As previously reported, they do provide you with dark chocolate at turndown.
__label__0 The Moore hotel was clean
__label__0 The requested room was "garden view" away from the heavy traffic outside the hotel.
__label__0 The food was good for an all-inclusive.
__label__0 There is an 8 pm light show at the harbor every night.
__label__0 If the price was right and only in a double room.
__label__0 I explained how bad everything was when I left, they replied you will have to talk to hotwire.
__label__0 it ruined our holiday in Berlin!!
__label__0 Found one bar just down the street taking a right out of the hotel which was a good night and one lovely one set in the walled garden area found by walking out of the hotel taking a left and left again and there is a large wall opposite 
__label__0 and they didn't know.
__label__0 Overall, if you have money to burn and are looking for a staff to challenge your patience,
__label__0 My husband and I stayed at the Westin for three nights.
__label__0 The location along the cable-car track put me at one end to Market Street and a connection near the top of Nob Hill brought me into either Union Square or Fishermans Wharf in good time to enjoy the many things that San Francisco had to offer.
__label__0 The rooms are large.
__label__0 Also, the resort did not have top shelf liquor.
__label__0 The trip was definately worthwhile.
__label__0 It had a full Kitchen, dining room area, bedroom with 2 beds and pull out couch.
__label__0 We had booked one of the red rooms, but on arrival were informed that one of the suites was available in an adjacent building down a short Calle.
__label__0 However, while the staff as a whole was great, there was a man on the desk ,name forgotten, that was condescending and a bit arrogant.
__label__0 so it is impossible to sleep on the fith
__label__0 The other manager ,Mr. Valdez, was very helpfull and helped me on my way.
__label__0 I had emailed the hotel before we left for Seattle to get a late check-out.
__label__0 We travelled with Sunwing Vacations out of Toronto.
__label__0 The housecleaning staff was very attentive and always turned down the room before we got back in the evenings.
__label__0 I was first given room #1, very dark and damp, had a basement feel since it was on the ground floor half buried in dirt.
__label__0 had to bust open windows after room was cleaned, too far and ugly to walk to Chinatown or North Beach ,they suggest that you walk through this filthy long tunnel to get there and if you dont its longer ,and just as un-scenic,, super noisy
__label__0 We had a spacious, well-decorated room.
__label__0 It is 20 minutes walk to the hotel from there or 5 minutes by cab.
__label__0 only to find it was closed.
__label__0 Room service breakfast was very good.
__label__0 I requested to be put on a waiting list
__label__0 Also had a fabulous meal at the Metro Grill next door.
__label__1 Beware as in the trip info it says that you can go snorkling but no gear is provided so if you want to snorkle take you own gear.
__label__0 The location of the hotel is good - fairly close to everything.
__label__0 The breakfasts are great - fresh fruit, bagels, muffins, hot eggs and sausage, etc.
__label__0 I really recommend the Westin.
__label__0 Not a good experience
__label__0 The restaurant was also nice
__label__0 We actually stayed at this W twice in ten days.
__label__0 Many nights, our room was not cleaned until 6 and 7 PM.
__label__0 Plenty of food to choose from, some you may like, some you may not.
__label__0 They weren't even apologetic.
__label__0 A very nice touch indeed.
__label__0 On the positive side the breakfast and the breakfastroom were very nice and the personnel was nice ,untill I complaint about the bugs,.
__label__0 Walking the Freedom Trail also helped.
__label__0 The Reception staff were aloof  sometimes quite rude.
__label__0 Chair upholstery needs to be cleaned.
__label__0 We had booked a non-smoking room but were given a smoking room instead.
__label__0 This is normally a pay-to-see commercial attraction separate from the hotel,
__label__0 Second, the staff.
__label__0 The shows are pretty good.
__label__0 Wyndham - Great Location
__label__0 Upon arrival at the Marriott, I knew things were not going to be so swell.
__label__0 We arrived in our room and even though the hotel is smoke-free, I began wheezing from the mold.
__label__0 Getting there by taxi can be a small problem first time but the hotel gives you a map so after the first time, there are no problems.
__label__0 Since we were tired, we ordered rooms service.
__label__0 We wanted to make dinner reservations for two nights and asked whether we needed reservations for a third restaurant.
__label__0 Doesnt feel like Japan hotel, more like a contemporary Hilton.
__label__0 Spent five nights and enjoyed the spacious and spotless very bright rooms, modern steam and sauna area with cold plunge, and complete breakfast buffet.
__label__0 Breakfast was on until 11 every morning and had a great selection from scrambled eggs to pastries.
__label__0 Worth a taxi sometimes...
__label__0 Luckily that was my last night at the A-Train.
__label__0 Who could ask for more?
__label__0 The breakfast includes fresh island fruits, juices, coffee/tea, pastries, yogurt, and hard boiled eggs.
__label__0 We thought that was a little odd for a king room.
__label__1 Room layout good - but would recommend some barrier to stop water from the shower getting the carpet wet
__label__0 and in-room internet was $11 a day.
__label__0 A huge decorated Cristmas tree and poinsettias in the lobby was enhanced by the deep red walls and wallpaper and crystal chandeliers.
__label__0 Excellent bartenders.
__label__0 I particularly like the free continental b-fest of muffins, bagels, cereal and yogurt, and the free gym which I noticed was recently re-furbished.
__label__0 In the first 2 days we were moved to 4 different rooms because of various problems ,original rooms safety box was broken, then we asked to be moved to a more quiet section, then the new room they gave us wasnt made up and when no one came after 4 hours we went to the reception desk where they upgraded us to a Tropical Junior Suite for the all the inconvenience.
__label__0 The check-in man then rang the hotel's reservation office
__label__0 while we were watching TV loudly.
__label__0 and the staff at the front desk were very helpful
__label__0 After I saw where the Crowne Plaza and Marriott was located, I was glad I won the Red Leeow bid, since we like being in the center of touristy things and this was it.
__label__0 Liked the room, and the location, but didn't care for the staff of the hotel.
__label__0 The lighting is a weak point as well, and so is the noisyness between rooms.
__label__0 Think you can do better.
__label__0 This was not the case and we were charged $13 a day for the privelege.
__label__0 The room was clean and HUGE
__label__0 and there were three flights clustered around one very small carousel, hundreds of people jostling and getting angry.
__label__0 as we had paid for the excellence club we were whisked away on arrival and taken to an air- conditioned room , which we both welcomed being from Scotland, and were given a glass of bubbly.
__label__0 but the luxury ends right there.
__label__0 Fortunately, the Sheraton is a few blocks away from great shopping and walking through the snow wasn't bad at all.
__label__0 ,These people work twelve hour days, dont get paid over-time and only get paid about $200 USD A MONTH,.
__label__0 Good hotel We booked our hotel and flight to
__label__0 The upgrade will allow access to free Continental Breakfast and afternoon cocktails.
__label__0 We sat there for a couple of hours every afternoon with a drink or two just watching Venice pass by.
__label__0 That being said, there are some areas that will exceed your expectations.
__label__0 Its a very quick ride.
__label__0 The pineapples tasted nothing like the delicious pineapples we had in Kauai the week before.
__label__0 It was not newly refurbished by any means.
__label__0 If not, stay away.
__label__0 The room, all mod cons, plasma, dvd, stereo, wireless keyboard for the internet ,chargeable,, quiet and reliable air con, nice window seat built into the ledge, reasonable min bar prices, pillow menu, slippers, gown etc.
__label__0 You won't be disappointed.
__label__0 but the room was a little small with a tiny bathroom.
__label__0 That way you avoid the queues and walk right in like an expected guest- free tour excellent.
__label__0 Denver does a much better job by discouraging tourists form giving to panhandlers and putting donation meters downtown to help fund the shelters and food kitchens.
__label__1 But make sure to ask for a high floor if you dont like the noise.
__label__0 Great resort
__label__0 The bath is finished in marble with a deep tub and hand-held shower which was a nice touch.
__label__0 We requested a smoking room on an upper floor with a Space Needle view.
__label__0 I highly recommend Hotel Metro and will likely stay there next time I visit wonderful New York City.
__label__0 Has very nice robes in room, CD player and DVD player.
__label__0 2004 2005.
__label__0 but please see my review of the Condado Plaza.
__label__0 while we went to Momma's Mexican a few blocks away.
__label__0 Close to the Mongkok MTR so convenient.
__label__0 We stayed here for 2 nights after a cruise and were quite pleased.
__label__0 Stayed 3 nights in March.
__label__0 We saw a couple of shows ,International and Michael Jackson, and liked them.
__label__0 The food was disappointing in presentation and flavour
__label__1 Make sure you bring plenty of sun tan lotion-very expensive in the gift shop.
__label__0 We stayed here for 1 night in August
__label__0 Front doors of rooms are old, not very energy efficient or sound proofed.
__label__0 We arrived at lunchtime - ordered food and proceeded to wait a LONG time.
__label__0 The Westin prides itself on its Heavenly Beds and I couldnt agree more with them.
__label__0 there are some places which may have great reviews for the hotel
__label__0 Breakfast was very good, cheese and cold meats, boiled eggs yoghurts, cereals, juice and a wide array of pastries and fresh fruit.
__label__0 The hotel is very tired and is in desperate need of a refurb.
__label__0 Its tough to find the positives after getting so upset about this vacation.
__label__0 They were redecorated in May 05 - so carpets etc. all virtually new.
__label__0 Rooms are tiny and the housekeeping isnt there after 1pm, so if u came back late and wanted to sleep in ur room wont get cleaned that day.
__label__0 We would have asked to be placed in another room if our schedule would have permitted.
__label__1 The location is perfect and I highly recommend the spa at the attached LA sports Club.
__label__0 he was extremely rude and would not hear our issue.
__label__0 The hotel has a Starbucks, Ruth Chris Steakhouse and The Cheesecake Factory.
__label__0 At the resort there is photo studio.
__label__0 We will never book this hotel again!
__label__0 When it was under the old name of Ocean Beach, it was considered a three star.
__label__0 We did Zip Lining which was great and the caribean festival catamaran.
__label__0 From the chromed elevator to the mysterious Murphy bed, the tear drop trash cans and the dimmable light tower, she was intrigued.
__label__0 We bought an octopus card at the airport for HK300 which included round trip train from the airport to Hong Kong station and 3 days of unlimited MTR rides.
__label__0 Otherwise you have no way of knowing what the restaurant hours are, rules about the towels, housekeeping number to call, etc.
__label__0 Slept VERY well.
__label__0 and even doubling up is not enough so sleeping for us was hard to achieve.
__label__0 There was no smell in our room but we were told we could upgrade to a supperior for free.
__label__0 It was newly renovated, clean and had a modern design.
__label__0 Really liked the room and had no problems with noise.
__label__0 However, only 2 of us stayed at the hotel
__label__0 So much is within walking distance,
__label__0 My wife and I stayed at the Coral Princess Inn for 3 days during October.
__label__0 On the same street two or three miles past nice office parks to the west are all sorts of great restaurants.
__label__0 BUT, this hotel made NO mention of any renovations on their website.
__label__1 The only warning I have to offer is if you want to sleep past 8 AM, make sure you hang the do not disturb sign on your door.
__label__0 The food was bascially the same day after day.
__label__0 Alltogether I enjoyed my stay and would book again at anything below $120 a night.
__label__0 My room was spacious and the bathroom had both a deep, clean tub at one end and excellent shower at the other.
__label__0 There was 6 of us and he had no problem arranging transportation for our ride there.
__label__0 Value for the price
__label__0 Breakfast was included in our deal,
__label__0 For example, the primary assailant attempted to murder one of my traveling companions as her hair was pulled and head held under water while her husband who shouted sexual obsenities toward us watched.
__label__0 If we knew that then we would of been happy to have a room in the old tower.
__label__0 they will make any drink you want them too.
__label__0 The bathroom was small, but the kitchenette and large living room more than made up for it.
__label__0 I have found that the Occidental Grand and Bahia Principe chains to be much better.
__label__0 No amenities at all...
__label__0 and we will bring it to you.
__label__0 A buck goes a very long way.
__label__0 When the baby woke me screaming at 4am I wanted to go pick her up myself it took so long before mom and dad got up to respond to her cries
__label__0 The location is a little more than a block to the MacPherson subway station.
__label__0 While not bad for families looking to save a little, it is not the luxurious resort for which it bills itself.
__label__0 and I almost seemed to touch the floor as I hopped on it.
__label__0 We were able to find seating without issue.
__label__0 Also all doors seem to have to slam to close.
__label__0 They were clean, comfortable and quiet.
__label__0 Our room was approximately $100 with tax per night.
__label__0 0
__label__0 and they happily supplied 2 nice comfy ones...no charge.
__label__0 Complimentary bottles of water and chocolates daily was good
__label__0 I didn't hear any noise from outside.
__label__0 I especially want to note the cleaning crew, who took the time to acknowledge us with a pleasant and sincere hello or good morning each time we passed.
__label__0 Also, for breakfast, the food was OK but there were no English Muffins, minimal pastries and cereals and just not a big selection.
__label__0 There is an exercise room which we did not use ,got enough exercise on the San Francisco hills,
__label__0 This gives the impression of it being dirty as soon a you walk in.
__label__1 I highly recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to avoid the giant impersonal hotels, as you will have all the amenities and none of the hassle.
__label__0 A full-length shower curtain would've been a much better option.
__label__0 we would have no problem choosing the Warwick again.
__label__0 After a 30-45 min horseback ride there is a good one-hour hike through some VERY rugged terrain of narrow paths, steep hills and very rocky.
__label__0 One evening I returned to my room to find both windows open.
__label__0 The front desk, however, was a horror show.
__label__0 We played the KoOlina golf course and it is well worth it
__label__0 We do not mind it either.
__label__0 Mostly the sidewalks are being rebuilt.
__label__0 Which doesn't make sense.
__label__0 Had a room on 9th floor overlooking Coit Tower and the Bay.
__label__0 Friendly service great location
__label__0 If you want a quiet Hotel near tourist sites, this is for you.
__label__0 I only wanted oatmeal,
__label__0 Management was rather rude to another fellow union member who wanted to bring in food and drinks for personal consumption.
__label__0 It was better and less expensive than the W Hotel, where I stayed a couple of years ago.
__label__0 We booked the city tour thru her ,she did all the calling, and she helped us reserve tickets for Alcatraz.
__label__0 They recommended a nearby grocery store for late night sweets.
__label__0 But they would not give me the government rate even
__label__0 Just about 3 blocks or so from the French Quarter and directly across the street from Harrahs Casino.
__label__0 The hotel is located about 15-20 minutes from central Hollywood, and is right in the center of Beverly Hills, on Beverwil Drive.
__label__0 If I had known what we would get, I would have asked for a room with a large window.
__label__0 The carpet from the 1970's has blue bows on it and looks like something from your grandmother's house.
__label__0 Very disappointing experience there!
__label__0 When we arrived, we found that there was no self parking available, only valet parking.
__label__0 At night there is not much Adult entertainment.
__label__0 and that they were able to hold our luggage in a securely locked room after we checked out.
__label__1 Boston itself is a really easy city to walk around and I would highy recommend it for a short break.
__label__0 It is really only a 10 minute drive from all the action.
__label__0 The price was ok but after staying- I would expect that the rates should be lowered.
__label__0 Light soothing decor.
__label__0 Even getting to and from the airport was a breeze.
__label__1 Don't eat breakfast in the restaurant, too costly.
__label__0 and great for shopping and the linens and bed were very comfortable.
__label__0 The walkways are lined with brown outdoor style carpet.
__label__0 Marie celeste hotel
__label__0 I used Priceline Name your own price and got a room for a 2 night stay for $101 a night.
__label__0 but the pool was rather cold and we therefore only used it once.
__label__0 This place is in a pretty excellent location really, right opposite the Zoo, specify a courtyard facing room if you want quiet,
__label__0 Say hi to the boys at the beach bar
__label__0 What a difference..
__label__0 The lobby is really fun with a computer area, lots of comfortable seating,
__label__0 The shower sprayed more water over the curtian then into the bath itself,
__label__0 Ours was perfect.
__label__0 A client of mine reserved the room and intended to pay for it.
__label__0 the price and the location.
__label__0 This hotel is on a main street, walking distance to Hollywood Blvd and in a safer part of Hollywood than many other hotels.
__label__0 We stayed at Hotel Andra for two nights.
__label__0 Luckily I managed to purchase earplugs later.
__label__0 They are quick with a hello and the hugs are a plenty.
__label__0 While they made some visible efforts to look for the box -- the fact is that Fedex showed the box signed for,
__label__0 I did not feel safe at this hotel.
__label__0 Getting around is easy thanks to the U-Bahn station practically on the doorstep.
__label__0 Very basic facilities with dated furniture.
__label__0 Parking is valet-only which is $35/night, but they double-charge you w/an additional $35/night for parking.
__label__0 The rooms were quite nice and clean.
__label__0 and all they said was they were sorry.
__label__0 They serve Starbucks and a wicked cheesecake sampler platter ,$13, which easily fed us all - we may not have finished it all
__label__0 The RDL was literally a block away, we could be there in about 5 mins.
__label__1 If you expect no more than that, you won't be disappointed.
__label__0 I was not happy about this but since we were starving our main priority was to eat.
__label__0 I never head anything while staying there.
__label__0 Dolce Vita Italian Restaurant - some of the dishes were good.
__label__0 Good location for shops and the famous tourist sites.
__label__0 When I approached the front desk, I was warmly greeted and notified that we were already pre-checked in; handed our room key; and offered some afternoon hot chocolate and fresh fruit in the lobby.
__label__0 The continental breakfast on offer was ideal with bagels ,cereals ,tea coffee, fresh fruit.
__label__0 Polite staff.
__label__1 If you go over by the to the left of the resort by the shops there is less sea weed.
__label__0 Moderate pricing and quiet location with parking, ,Fee $9 to $12,, yet still close to the Waikiki scene made it a good choice for us.
__label__0 m.on Friday night that a fax was waiting for me at the front desk (the business center was closed), when I went to get it, the staff couldn't find it after 15 minutes of searching.
__label__0 The room was clean, laundry request was excellent but expensive.
__label__0 First it is true that the hotel is about 10min by car from the central station and the building looks terrible from the outside ,used to be an old hospital,.
__label__1 Easy walk to the beach and the aquarium ,highly recommend.
__label__0 and that's the only place I'll stay next time.
__label__1 I highly recommend the hotel, especially at the priceline rate of $55.00 per night ,+ tax and fees,.
__label__0 I was really impressed with their renovated modern lobby,
__label__0 I had to do with the leftovers at 9 o clock.
__label__1 However, if you are simply wanting a nice vacation in relaxing area then the Copamarina is a good choice.
__label__0 The best part about the hotel was the location as it was in walking distance of the Space Needle, The Public Market and for us Qwest Field.
__label__0 It has a nice lobby
__label__0 THe JW Marriot Gofl Resort in KoOlina.
__label__0 Since we were not able to do so we remained at the Flamenco, where the next morning a note under our door informed us that more renovations were planned which interfered with the operation of the both the Mexican and the Italian restaurant.
__label__0 The rooms are exceptionally clean and inviting.
__label__0 I had a nasty fall when the shower suddenly became very hot.
__label__0 Great location, a short walk to shopping  many popular points of interest (e.g. Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag, museums, checkpoint charlie).
__label__0 Another thing is that the cleaning lady just walked into my room on the morning of my last day.
__label__0 Due to the fact that we are experienced cruisers, an all inclusive vacation had alot to live up to.
__label__0 the hotel has the feel of a traditional hotel.
__label__0 The hotel is under construction so the entrance is poorly marked on the side side of the hotel.
__label__0 Probably the most enjoyable aspect of both our stays was the staff.
__label__0 I had booked a double room but got two single beds, with a folded duvet resting at the bottom of the bed;
__label__0 One of the best hotels Ive ever stayed in.
__label__0 The room was clean and well maintained.
__label__0 The room had a small balcony overlooking Park Avenue South and 26th Street.
__label__0 The guest service simply said that we have your inquiry on file.
__label__0 We had a room upgrade and a variety of gifts, free dinner, etc, to apologise for our inconvenience.
__label__0 The hotel is very clean, beautiful and offers friendly service.
__label__0 We would definetely stay at this hotel again.
__label__0 Besides their convenient location, I would mention that the attentiveness, friendliness, and efficiency of the staff with whom we interacted were consistently excellent, and it is this, more than anything, that prompts me to give more than one star.
__label__0 and I thought the location was perfect for us - close to Pikes Place market (can buy anything), the Waterfront (Bainbridge Ferry/shops, seafood restaraunts), Belltown (pubs/clubs), and the Monorail for a trip to the Space Needle area.
__label__0 and just walked in immediately after knocking.
__label__0 I called the hotel and asked why I wasn't called.
__label__0 We would not book in summer.
__label__0 We were relieved to discvover that the buffet at the Palace was much better - excellent really.
__label__0 The best part of the meal was the appetizers: meats, cheese, and the bread
__label__0 Check In is at 3 PM, however, we arrived at 10 AM and got our room right away
__label__0 We also asked if we could keep one room till about 1pm and check out from the other two rooms since our flight was at 5pm and we were planning to leave the hotel around 2pm.
__label__0 and felt like they were poorly washed.
__label__0 From 8 o' clock on it was just a banging of doors and throwing things around in the hallway.
__label__0 We tried the pool to relax ouserselves
__label__0 The front desk service was great - they recommended great places to eat, order delivery, and get a shuttle to the airport.
__label__0 I had to ask for bathrobes which were advertised as part of the room package, but they were delivered promptly.
__label__0 Now, the neighborhood immediately outside the door looks even safer
__label__0 Avoid this Sweat Shop Resort
__label__0 We visited the Bahia Principe next door and were VERY glad we chose the Majestic as their layout is much more preferred.
__label__0 After a long day we opted for room service in the evening which was very good.
__label__0 It appears there is one main kitchen.
__label__0 My working sister appreciated the free wi-fi.
__label__0 Love the pink palace
__label__0 GREAT LOCATION: Close to the theatre district, Boston Common, Newberry Street, and the Long Wharf area.
__label__0 The hotel lobby, hallways and elevators are not at all impressive and very small, but the large clean rooms are a pleasant surprise when you open the room door.
__label__0 Fantastic breakfast with an incredible selection of meats, cheeses, yogurts, breads etc. And, as a non-German speaker,
__label__0 The room was spacious and spotless.
__label__0 No word about it on their webpage.
__label__0 The last bus from the centre to the hotel leaves at 02:45am
__label__0 more like a bitter sip of bad coffee at the end of a great meal.
__label__0 Considering I had just arrived ,with my three kids, it wasnt likely I was buying drinks for some stanger in a bar.
__label__0 you come to the end of a regular-looking hotel corridor, pass through a lounge, and into a narrow, dark and musty corridor with doorways just about your height and barely wide enough to fit your carry-on luggage ... well,
__label__0 Though, we are fully aware that european hotels are less in quality compared with the ones in Asia or US.
__label__0 The mosquitos were not a problem either.
__label__1 Through the resort you can contact a guy named Angel for some of the best scuba diving I have ever done in my life.
__label__0 Because I couldn't even get a glass of water or a bottle of water at this hotel, I will look elsewhere for my next stay.
__label__0 We were finally given an alternate room, which did not have as good a view as originally ordered, but was OK.
__label__0 Dont promise me something that I paid for and I expect to get and then not deliver because its the off season, or your not at full capacity.
__label__0 Stayed recenty to attend a Giants game.
__label__0 And yup, parking is expensive everywhere in SEA.
__label__0 Plenty of TV channels in many languages.
__label__0 only slight criticism was the room where you have breakfast,
__label__0 Internet is $9.95 per day.
__label__0 the service was great the only mistake was one day the room was not clean when I returned that afternoon
__label__0 No better place to stay in Venice.
__label__0 We had booked reservations at Sheraton in Hawaii prior to this experience.
__label__0 Sometimes in Manhattan the hotels lean to business class or carry the attitude that theres more where you came from, consequently you dont get that personal service.
__label__0 We live in a Seattle suburb and wanted to stay downtown for a wedding.
__label__0 Since the mayority of vacationers are from Spain, Portugal, Canadian and Argentinian to name a few, most of the food is guided toards them.
__label__0 and I. I was excited when we first checked in because the lobby is very grand and fairly well appointed.
__label__0 Im going back there this year and will definately stay there again.
__label__0 and they were kind enough to take care of them until I returned the next day, ashamed but extremely grateful.
__label__1 Drinks: Unless you like really sweet drinks, you might want to consider bringing your own mixers..
__label__0 The goodies in the bathroom are very high quaility.
__label__0 The grounds were beatiful and at night the ground lighting created a romantic effect in the landscaping.
__label__0 Resort does not take care of its beach though.
__label__0 Thanks to your reviews, I was able to eliminate some of my potential choices and to pick the Hotel Metro, where we got a family suite with 2 bedrooms- one for Mom Dad, and one for the teen-age girls.
__label__0 Two full size beds in a tiny closet of a room ,1107, with four people, three over 58 tall.
__label__0 my husband is usually the one with the back pain!
__label__0 I stayed there on business for 4 nights in early June.
__label__0 I thought this hotel would be okay since I was not planning on being in it very often and I really just needed a convenient location to sleep.
__label__0 staff were less than helpful.
__label__1 Abit impersonal though, so if you are looking for a place remembering your name Conrad isnt the first place to look, on most important points it clearly delivers.
__label__0 but I haven't found any kind of design in the rooms.
__label__0 At the Moore, you have it all at your doorstep.
__label__0 Actually, I was one day early but since the hotel was about 17% occupied, it wasnt a problem.
__label__0 it is a fairly typical four star hotel, without any features to really set it apart from the rest.
__label__0 We chose the Mandarin Oriental as we felt to old for South Beach and we were glad we made the right choice.
__label__0 The rooms are spacious
__label__0 Excellent fitness room, though I did not use the spa/pool.
__label__0 They gave me a single bed when i asked for seperate queen beds.
__label__0 I know that that is what they do but come-on, $22 USD for a raw hamburger with fries?
__label__0 I will definitely return to The Toren on a future trip--just with my husband this time
__label__0 Its like stepping into my nans living room with brown and orange geometric patterned carpets and 70s furniture.
__label__0 Connectivity from the hotel to all important places is good as it is right in front of the main station.
__label__0 and that breakfast was between 7-10,I put this down to me being tired
__label__0 Wouldnt return to New York though, thought it was just the same as any other city.
__label__0 Two lounge chairs were struck in the corner where you couldn't really even see the TV.
__label__0 We choose to stay at HI Exp when we can because they are reasonably priced and include a substantial breakfast and you know exactly what youre going to get because the quality of the hotels are all very similar.
__label__0 We thought that there was no way that the hotel could still be under construction,
__label__0 The desk staff are great but if you need anything special ask for Leonor who will go out of her way to get what you need.
__label__0 Staff warm,sincere,would like to think its deliberate to employ these type of people, because it works
__label__0 Housekeeping was curteous and kept my room clean and stocked.
__label__0 we stayed at the Ritz Carlton  paid a similar price to the Hilton; on our next visit we will certainly go back to the Ritz Carlton, as it is that bit more special.
__label__0 This hotel ruined not only my weekend, but my vacation and the relaxation I hoped to get.
__label__0 Not the greatest
__label__0 We were unable to stop at the hotel before the game.
__label__0 The rooms were big enough, clean and very confortable,
__label__0 I couldn't believe it was so difficult to get a cup of coffee in SEATTLE!
__label__0 We were very dissapointed: Noisy (nightclub next to building, busy street),
__label__0 The hotel was in a perfect location to explore all the sights in Amsterdam.
__label__0 I had asked for a quiet room.
__label__0 Reception staff smiley and helpfull, okay the room was small but spotless, well comfy beds, great view across berlin and breakfast well and truly fed us.
__label__0 I was charged for 3 nights rather than just 2.
__label__0 The staff was extremely professional and courteous and bent over backwards to accommodate our requests.
__label__0 This was not too miserable
__label__0 With Waikiki Beach right on your doorstep and so many alternatives for evening entertainment, who wants to spend all their time in the hotel any way ?
__label__0 they said they haven't honored that for weeks.
__label__0 Reception staff were plain rude
__label__0 Mercato St. Lorenzo is just steps from the hotel.
__label__0 We all did take a soak in that huge tub, though.
__label__0 First, the location.
__label__0 It was just over 5 minutes walk to Dam Square and a couple of minutes away from Rembrantplein where there were lots of bars, clubs and restaurants.
__label__0 Stayed for 3 nights and have mixed feelings about this hotel.
__label__0 The Greyline tour buses and airport shuttle have a desk in the lobby
__label__0 That evening, I discovered that I had forgotten my laptop power adapter in the Sheraton hotel room.
__label__0 It done its job but didn't make you want to refill your plate a second time.
__label__0 There are escalators from the main entrance up to the lobby and they are surrounded by lots of greenery and flowers.
__label__0 There was garbage ,straws, cigarette butts, cups, broken glass, all over the place.
__label__0 not to bad, quite spacious and looked clean.
__label__0 and dry cleaning was performed timely and skillfully.
__label__0 great hotel 14 of us stayed here for a hen weekend our stay was almost faultless.
__label__0 The bathroom was very dated  disappointing, in particular I could not believe the shower was in a 5 star hotel.
__label__0 Rooms are spacious, clean and elegant.
__label__0 The living space was quite nice.
__label__0 The bedding heavenly--we were on the club level
__label__0 The hotel is clean, the rooms were comfortable.
__label__0 You dont have to ask for anything, some how the staff seems to understand what you need and they do cartwheels to make you happy.
__label__0 The service was above average, but not as excellent as all of the reviews that I had read.
__label__0 The transfers worked smoothly and our accommodation in Vancouver was just as advertised.
__label__0 $85 + parking was better than I was expecting.
__label__0 you are supposed to be dining there, to be very frustrating.
__label__0 The hotel looked very new.
__label__0 I thought that was a nice touch.
__label__0 Service at the Ritz-Carlton has always been excellent and this stay the staff were at their best.
__label__0 Our decision on this property was made based on the information in the Air Transat Holidays brochure and the Occidental Gran Flamenco website, neither of which mentioned any renovations.
__label__0 Okay, this is NOT a glam hotel,
__label__0 The other block (directly above the main entrance) is still trapped in the 1970's time warp that's been mentioned by previous contributors.
__label__0 My teenage daughter and I stayed at this hotel for four nights in early July.
__label__0 but the weekend front desk staff can be rude.
__label__0 The room was very clean, the beds comfortable, had a huge walk-in closet (doubles for a small bedroom, haha) and extremely affordable.
__label__0 Breakfast was large and wonderful.
__label__0 It is billed as being a small luxury hotel but really didn't see it as being any different other than decor.
__label__0 Other problems that cropped up was that we bought some cakes
__label__0 I stayed at the Westin in mid september after having stayed there in 2005.
__label__0 Hotel amenities were excellent.
__label__1 Walk 2 to 3 blocks away and get a muffin, coffee, or egg sandwich for about 6 Euros..
__label__1 AS A MATTER OF FACT, AVOID ALL SECRETS RESORTS, AS THEY ARE BUILDING WITHIN PLAYA DEL CARMEN, AND HAVE OTHER RESORTS.
__label__0 Overall a good expereience.
__label__0 The bathroom door has a hole for a handle,
__label__0 and we certainly got that.
__label__0 There were plenty of choices and I especially enjoyed the seafood - calamari, grouper, salmon, shrimp, were really good.
__label__0 A Quiet and Quaint
__label__0 That was it.
__label__0 The positives on the room are that is was a large room, king bed was nice, it was also very clean.
__label__0 We didn't take the Hotel breakfast at 20 Eu each.
__label__0 The hotel was sold out and I could not move to another room.
__label__0 Be prepared that most Berlin hotels do NOT have air conditioning!
__label__0 In fact, the breakfast buffet gave an American, a Chinese and a finicky 5-year-old great choices.
__label__0 Location was not ideal although in any big city no location is ideal for everywhere anyway.
__label__0 I am more of an open-window kinda person, that's why I requested a quiet room.
__label__0 The hotel is ideally located.
__label__0 Wonderful concierge who recommended restaurants as well as sent me to a bike shop where i could rent a bike to ride around frankfurt for the day.
__label__0 The restaurant they recommended was good.
__label__0 But then it turns out that there where 2 rooms in my room.
__label__0 Over rated and over priced.
__label__0 It seemed recently renovated with an updated decor.
__label__0 lock seemed out of alignment.
__label__0 They had so much energy
__label__1 Brilliant Hotel - would recommend to anyone.
__label__0 Asked for another mattress because it was like you are sleeping on a stone.
__label__0 Stayed here in June/06 for 7 nights.
__label__0 and there was scaffolding hanging outside of our window all three days that we were there.
__label__0 It seemed like they were updating some of the other floors, but they didn't get to that one yet.
__label__0 Cabs to the hotels are a flat $11.00 ,which includes a $1.00 fuel surcharge,.
__label__0 The parking attendants in particular were very helpful with allowing us access to the garage if we needed to get to the car, but weren't going anywhere in it.
__label__0 and they let me print it for free in their business center.
__label__0 Sure enough, they did move us the next day into a beautiful room with a gorgeous view of the Space Needle.
__label__0 We got up in the middle of the night to crank up the AC and open the window, but the temperature didn't change.
__label__0 Our friends book at the priemer and had a private pool and resturant.
__label__0 The only winners are part of the gang themselves 
__label__0 We were forced to pay $10 for a bottle of Evian in the bar one night because there is just nothing near by on foot.
__label__0 The view of the ocean and Palomino Island was breathtaking.
__label__0 Good clean rooms, breakfasts were more than ample and served well.
__label__0 I expect at least they should 1) if the room has not been rented out, send someone to check; or 2) if the room was rented out, send a message to the new guest.
__label__1 The hotel decor is very tasteful and trendy, and while the wallpaper may need a tiny bit of work here and there, as has been mentioned before, its really not a big deal.
__label__0 Staff disorganized and surly.
__label__0 Beautiful decor and great views from the 3 windows in the room
__label__0 the one almost opposite -called the Meineke I believe, was good, but we also enjoyed the small restaurant, which you would probably mistake for a bar on the same side as the hotel at the top of the street as you head towards the Ku'Damn.
__label__0 One evening, dinner took 3.5 hours after arrival.
__label__0 They didn't even offer to have someone carry my suitcases up the stairs.
__label__0 The breakfast is extra ,8.5euro,not a huge choice, 1 roll, 1 croissant each and some ham and cheese, tea and coffee etc.
__label__0 I sent my husband to get me an Aspirin until we buy one at a pharmacy.
__label__0 and also that I had booked a cheapie.
__label__0 There is no fruit complementary despite some website say it is provided.
__label__0 This is unusual and may be due to size of the rooms but for such a well thought out hotel, I thought this was a significant issue.
__label__0 shopping and sightseeing and of course at this time of year there are a few Christmas markets within walking distance.
__label__0 We stayed at the Sheraton for two nights after our Alaskan cruise.
__label__0 but this seems like the only good thing about it.
__label__0 I was really shocked,
__label__0 Terrible Behaviour, good breakfast
__label__0 The staff was very friendly and courteous.
__label__0 He lost everything in the storm.
__label__0 and other traffic noise that it sounded like a freight train was going to come through the wall at any time.
__label__0 It was at this time we tried to contact the Air Transat Holidays representative for Punta Cana, she did not answer at the number we had been given at any time between 7:30 to10:00 pm.
__label__0 It was a perfect location, allowing us to get out quickly to see the sights, and make easy visits back for a rest or to freshen up.
__label__0 Upon arrival, checked in went up to the room and was very dissappointed.
__label__0 Friendly staff, good drinks and draft beer selection and a nice atmosphere.
__label__0 We did not try the food in the two reservation only restaurants so I cant comment on those.
__label__0 The location is simply perfect and the staff must be among the friendliest and most helpful we have ever come across.
__label__0 We had no food related sicknesses during our trip.
__label__0 First I was told that there was a military rate,
__label__0 We gave up and returned the following day for the remainder of our stay.
__label__0 Great room with big bathroom.
__label__0 I am absolutely sick that we are now stuck at this hotel.
__label__1 Its also a great location if you love shopping because Nordstrom and Macys are right up the street as well as 2 big malls, Westlake Center and Pacific Place.
__label__0 Thank goodness there are plenty of alternative hotels for future visits and for us to recommend to others.
__label__0 Easy.
__label__0 Nothing.
__label__0 The decor was nice, different and a bit funky.
__label__0 the hotel is near Alexander Platz,
__label__0 The entertainment crew did a great job.
__label__0 After a very promising reception, our room was disappointingly small for a hotel of this rating without any views.
__label__0 I was hoping for something decent, and at first look I could not complain.
__label__0 I loved this hotel and would recommend it to anyone.
__label__0 My husband and I just returned from Bahia Principe after spending 1 week from May 19th-May 26th.
__label__0 2 days went by where our room was not even cleaned at all, no new towels, nothing.
__label__0 Enjoyed the Stay
__label__0 My three children ages 9, 14, 16 and I stayed at the El Conquistador from Jan 20-25, 2007.
__label__0 We were travelling with 2 small children (57) so booked one room for us all.
__label__0 No attempt was made to look for it.
__label__0 It wasn't all bad though.
__label__0 Turns out that was not what the hotel offered.
__label__0 For the price I paid I wasn't expecting a nice room, but the one I was allocated on the 12th floor I was very pleased with.
__label__0 No view at all.
__label__0 At any rate, I have no idea how they can call themselves 5-star.
__label__0 and the Westin was booked out where i had been staying for 5 nights.
__label__0 Obviously, itll take more than two months to get to the four star level.
__label__0 We were blinded with the wonderful brochure and the webside about this Hotel Paradisus.
__label__0 There were underground stations five minutes away ,Victoria and Pimlico, but the bus was better and not so crowded.
__label__0 It was expensive (parking is $35/night)
__label__0 It needs to decide whether it wants to be 'designer' or just a smart hostel.
__label__0 but you can't beat the location!
__label__0 Then, the display returns the number/letter of the car which will take you to your floor.
__label__0 It was slightly cool outside
__label__0 We were told to go,
__label__0 The building was characteristically New Orleans and made me feel like I was staying with family or friends rather than at a hotel.
__label__1 Definitely avoid travelling by Easyjet at weekend late evenings!
__label__0 I must say that I was very impressed with the service at the hotel.
__label__0 My husband and I stayed at The Moore for 3 nights/4 days beginning on September 15th.
__label__0 but there were some tourists like us as well.
__label__0 I stayed here regularly for work for about 2 months this year.
__label__0 Tips for Berlin: Public transport is brilliant.
__label__0 My room was on the 4th floor, that had dark and claustrophobic hallways.
__label__0 Food is mostly where the Majestic loses 1 star.
__label__0 Stayed at the hotel over Easter 2005.
__label__0 On the other hand, this inflexible halfwall must be a major obstacle for the room ladies when they're cleaning the upper part of the tub.
__label__0 There are lots of great shops around the hotel.
__label__0 Beware that the so-called standard room is so tiny,
__label__0 The obviously new beds and bedding were super-luxurious.
__label__0 My room was not cleaned until very late in the day even
__label__0 We found it worn and noisy.
__label__0 I do have to mention the staffs were excellent in all departments of the hotel, Very helpful.
__label__0 My only complaint is street noise.
__label__0 The breakfast area next to the lobby was excellent with the morning sun beating in.
__label__0 On the third day I tackled them again about the problem .
__label__0 The AC worked fine and the room was very clean.
__label__0 We went every day.
__label__0 The bathroom was dated (compared to other hotels we had just visited), a pretty pathetic shower and a hole in the ceiling.
__label__0 The Hilton accepted this without any drama; one staff in the exec lounge was at first unaware of the hotel policy on assistance dogs; one cleaning woman seemed to be terrified of the dog, otherwise Pema quickly become a favorite with the other hotel guests.
__label__0 The restaurant on property was ok - but did not bill to your room.
__label__0 and even after me asking if I could speak with somebody else and being TOLD to take a seat in the bar as it would take a
__label__1 This makes me not want to recommend this hotel.
__label__0 Breakfast is a buffet continental repast-- the room gets crowded but the food is quite fresh.
__label__0 It was not locked so anyone could walk in.
__label__0 Dont judge a book by its cover
__label__0 In addition, just a stonethrow away, The Palast der Republik was in the process of being torn down.
__label__0 Also after flying from Montreal we had to wait 20 minutes to be picked up and after returning to the hotel had a wait another 15 minutes to get the car back and we were the only ones there at the time.
__label__0 We finally accepted our fate and reconciled to spend the night in the cell block.
__label__0 and we had to cut our vacation short.
__label__0 The kids had stuffed animals and baseball caps on their beds
__label__0 Both are a block away.
__label__0 The decor is in muted tones and interesting textures.
__label__0 Every night the kids were involved in putting on little shows.
__label__0 When I made the reservations, I told the hotel that we would have a late arrival but please save a room on the higher floors with a view for us, as we would be there 2 nights.
__label__0 Since the pod shower only works when it is closed, it is not possible to get warm water flowing before you step into the pod.
__label__0 Whatever.
__label__0 The spa was great, just what we needed after the hot weather we'd had.
__label__0 the rooms were fairly dirty.
__label__0 One thing we discovered very quickly that in Berlin the hotel you choose is all about location,
__label__0 and this was the worst hotel experience I have ever had.
__label__0 I try to book it every business trip to Sydney.
__label__0 I also enjoyed the Japanese where the cook prepared the food in front of you and does a little show off routine.
__label__0 It was about 7 mins away.
__label__0 Maybe that is why there is a discount.
__label__0 great experience except... ...for the concierge problem.
__label__0 Good Value Hotel
__label__0 But the location was just unacceptable for a pleasure trip.
__label__0 By international standards, the price of the room was very reasonable.
__label__0 They agreed to give me a room (hmmm...thought they were sold out) but said they couldn't accomodate all the nights of my stay.
__label__0 We spent 5 days at this hotel in August 2007 and will be looking no further when we return to Honolulu.
__label__0 The room was modernly decorated and within easy walking distance of Grand Central Station and the subway.
__label__0 and I never heard noise (i.e. someone else's loud TV) except for the occasional bus route on the street below.
__label__0 but the parking is $27 a day for guests which we thought pricey.
__label__0 I use TripAdvisor.com regularly so when I saw that the Radisson SAS Berlin had been rated the number one hotel in the city I was confident I would be in for something special.
__label__1 Bus #1 from the train station is most direct but #25 and #33 will get you there also.
__label__0 Beds were clean, towels changed each day, no sign of bed bugs ,despite extensive searching on arrival,.
__label__0 The location was great--close to Pikes Market and great shopping.
__label__0 The other times that we contacted front desk/guest services (very difficult to tell them apart) we were met by unhelpful  unknowledgable staff for very straightforward requests verging on the sarcastic and rude.
__label__0 This is definitely a four star hotel as noted in China ,trip advisor lists it as a 3 star,.
__label__0 The hotel is modern, clean (very) business hotel,
__label__0 We found the staff ,especially the reception and bar staff, extremely friendly.
__label__0 Everything worked well though
__label__0 The hotel was selected due to the proximity of a convention I attended at the Mascone Convention Center.
__label__0 For the rate, it has to be the best value and the best comfort in San Francisco.
__label__0 That made all their restaurants under some degree of renovation with no clear plan on how to provide food services to their guests.
__label__0 The blankets were really, really worn, but the sheets seemed clean.
__label__0 Though, there are a significant number of places to eat within walking distance.
__label__0 We have now stayed at the Nob Hill Motor Inn three times and have been there several nights each time we were in San Franscisco.
__label__1 Remember to bring comfy walking shoes, the Melia Caribe Tropical is huge
__label__0 beds looked horrible and the pillows were on the floor???
__label__0 Each night there was no more than three choices of places to eat.
__label__0 It made me feel uncomfortable both times that I had to witness such rude behavior from the staff, and that would just lead me to believe that this hotel, quite frankly, does not like kids or value them as guests.
__label__0 Most importantly, the staff were very helpful and friendly.
__label__0 He is an amazing source of information.
__label__0 The room was ok
__label__0 I also tried the Spanish, Italian, Japanese and Brasilian restaurants.
__label__1 The roof top pool, ok is on the small side but the beach is only 5 minutes walk away if you need more water
__label__0 Check in was prompt, the desk people were very friendly and the rooms were ok.
__label__0 and I think they never changed the towels.
__label__0 Most of the reviews stated that the staff was very helpful and friendly.
__label__0 Awesome Experience
__label__1 Choose to go to the specialty resturants on other nights.
__label__0 We wanted to make this trip special, fun, and the resort ruined it.
__label__0 Boy, its going to be tough to write this review.
__label__0 Great value in Seattle
__label__0 and there were no bath matts.
__label__0 We will definetely go back.
__label__0 The young fellow at front desk was a pleasure to talk with.
__label__0 Ambassador recently with a couple friends.
__label__0 That was pretty much the only contact we had with her.
__label__0 Loved the vibe of the hotel.
__label__0 Location is great.
__label__1 The only seating times available are 6pm or 8pm but if you show up after 9:30pm at any of the restaurants they will just seat you.
__label__0 Our weekend got off to a bad start when one girl had her purse pinched on the metro ,be very careful, but the reception staff were very helpful and told us exactly what we needed to do and where the police station was.
__label__0 Meridien right after they took over from the Park Hyatt so things were still a bit chaotic-everything still said Hyatt.
__label__0 Not much of a view as all the surrounding buildings are the same height.
__label__0 I would go here if money were of no object (and not otherwise).
__label__0 We enjoyed a great breakfast the next morning in the hotel restaurant.
__label__0 Otherwise there ar places nearer.
__label__0 Furthermore, the glass half-wall glued to the bathtub was inadequate when showering, with lots of water on the floor as a result.
__label__0 I felt I was staying at a **star hotel room.
__label__0 My room on the Club Level was brand new with a soothing updated look and excellent bedding.
__label__0 I was pleasantly surprised that I was given a room with a king-size bed,
__label__1 Room was big, bath was lovely, but watch out for the tile floor after you shower.
__label__0 Very easy to walk to restaurants, even to walk to North Beach.
__label__0 He seemed less than apologetic and asked for payment for the wine!
__label__0 The only downside , or upside depending on how you look at it, is: This isnt a trendy hotel, like some in Dallas.
__label__0 the dining room is elegant!
__label__0 I thought the food was good and we enjoyed the open air cafe and the music at night.
__label__0 I had read that the street was a bit noisy,
__label__0 Every single employee treated us as royalty, or better yet as their family.
__label__0 Bedroom was standard size and decorated in classic style.
__label__0 Now on to my main complaint.
__label__1 You can also use the MTR which is 4 mins from the hotel.
__label__0 We asked for robes
__label__1 Be sure to pick up an umbrella (for free) at the concierge if you anticipate rain while sightseeing.
__label__0 The hotel doesn't have a shuttle so the only other option was a cab which is about $30.The hotel restaurant is adequate
__label__0 Just returned from Berlin, Germany and the Savoy Hotel was quite nice.
__label__0 (We tried the last part and they didn't care)
__label__0 We got a rate of $99 on Priceline.
__label__0 This hotel is exceptional value for money.
__label__0 My mini bar was locked
__label__0 Upon the first request, we were told we would have to wait at least a half hour
__label__0 The entry hall was all marble, as were the two flights of stairs you had to climb to get to our suite.
__label__0 However, they overbooked the property when I got there and would only accomodate me in a smoking environment.
__label__0 The only other issue we had is that you can hear everything in the room next door through the connecting locked door.
__label__0 Great I really dont understand how people can have a bad experience with this hotel, the one thing that made it such a nice place was the staff, they are sooo friendly
__label__0 The hotel is across from Victoria Park, which is great.
__label__0 Nice modern hotel.
__label__0 Some of the lack of amenities in the $450/night junior suite in which I stayed:No ironing boardNo pants hangersVery few tissues ,a small package of 4,A 1x1 bar of soapNo face washclothsOne English channel on TVNo alarm clockNo secured Wi-Fi and have to get new username/pswd each day
__label__0 The rooms were very clean, and we had a beautiful view of the Hudson river from the 22nd floor.
__label__0 The room was clean but bare of any decoration.
__label__0 What respectable hotel, especially one with such expensive rooms, would have the gall to also charge lodging for their guests' cars?
__label__0 I have been to Punta Cana before and stayed at a Riu resort which was nice but I liked this much better.
__label__0 Nothing spectacular.
__label__0 Nice hotel with good location near the shopping area, subway station, Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church etc. Rooms are quite small, but clean and modern.
__label__0 The location is quite good.
__label__0 There is only one restaurant but the hotel is close to the Hollywood and Highland complex with a choice of restaurants Italian, American, Japanese and sort of French.
__label__0 Our room was an oceanview standard with King bed on the 12th floor.
__label__0 This was my 3rd long stay at the hotel,
__label__0 and you have to go through the lobby to get to it.
__label__0 The location is ideal, two minutes walk from the Sagrada Familia and the Linea 5 metro station.
__label__0 On weeknights we had the facilitiies practically all to ourselves.
__label__0 The rooms are elegant and charming with the highest ceilings and the most wonderful hand carved doors.
__label__0 Turn around immediately and return to the front desk, where you will be charged an extra 30 Euros per night for a "renovated" room that, upon inspection, hasn't been renovated anytime in recent memory, but is at least cleaner and does not smell.
__label__0 Very comfortable bed, lovely furnishings, really large wardrobe, nice ammenties.
__label__0 Worst part - Parking - you have to pay,
__label__0 it was a sign i should have checked out immediately - at one point there wasn't even hot water in the hotel for over an hour.
__label__0 It was in the middle of the tourist section.
__label__0 The room was clean and fresh smelling.
__label__0 the only saviour was the ARTOTEL across the street which had a nice bar
__label__0 The owners of the hotel couldnt be nicer or more helpful, gladly answering our questions and making sure our stay was a good one.
__label__0 Unfortunately this establishment falls a bit short.
__label__0 Everything you could imagine from cereals to freshly made pancakes with maple syrup(recommended).
__label__0 He got an extra guy to help with all of our gear.
__label__0 And they are good photos.
__label__0 Clearly a luxury hotel but surprisingly ordinary.
