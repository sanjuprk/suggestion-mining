__label__0 I won't make any effort to stay at the Sheraton again!!/n__label__0 The staff was very friendly,/n__label__0 The room was clean and quiet./n__label__0 There was no apology from them for the mistake or the inconvenience./n__label__0 There was also one ratty, old floor mat./n__label__0 The ones on the front are very noisy./n__label__0 We never had any trouble finding a hut and did not play the towel game./n__label__0 Checked into Alexander Plaza on a Friday afternoon for two nights./n__label__1 So if you want nightlife, you need to drive to it./n__label__0 I would stay again in a heartbeat./n__label__0 So unless you are a really early riser or a really heavy sleeper, the noise factor will be quite a problem./n__label__0 We stayed at the Warwick for a night in October./n__label__0 It is only a few blocks from Pike Place Market and lots of restaurants and shops./n__label__0 There was no coffee maker in the room./n__label__0 The rooms are clean/n__label__0 The lobby was lovely to hang out in, the restaurant was very, very good./n__label__0 It has beds in the pool in the shade and also in the sun./n__label__0 Very large bathroom and lots of hot water and pressure in the morning./n__label__1 But make sure to ask for a high floor if you dont like the noise./n__label__0 P.S Noticed a bar is being added at street level, not sure whether will be hotel run or indepedndent?/n__label__0 The workout room on the 5th floor was nice, and it seemed to be getting regular use from the hotel guests./n__label__1 Stayed here for a conference and would not advise it for people with other options./n__label__0 Interior entrance to rooms./n__label__0 well appointed,wonderful breakfast buffet./n__label__0 I may be too crititical,/n__label__0 Still a good meal, but still something that leaves you wanting the taste of something sweeter at the end./n__label__0 Beware that the so-called standard room is so tiny,/n__label__0 We filled up each morning on fresh fruits, eggs, dim sum, french toast, potatos, noodles, pastries./n__label__0 the butler who was a kind of concierge, and was very pushy in getting us to book excursions from which the hotel was clearly making money - this butler often made us very uncomfortable, and was not knowledgeable about Bali and gave us very poor advice which wasted our time and money./n__label__0 cozy ambience and we enjoyed warming up there after our sightseeing./n__label__0 I had expected more from this hotel./n__label__0 The kids ,7 years old, had a great time and are already asking when we are going to go back./n__label__0 but it was really just a huge waste of space./n__label__0 There was only 1 chair/n__label__0 We tried two other restaurants but the Supreme seemed to have the most options./n__label__0 as an aleternative they sent us to a cheap and ugly motel./n__label__0 Fortunately I caught the error before getting on./n__label__0 Other than that, our room was very clean and quiet./n__label__0 However, there was nothing exceptional about them./n__label__0 But it hasnt put me off the place, and it will definitley be our choice of hotel when we return, which I hope will not be too far away/n__label__0 Check in on a Thursday evening was rapid we chose this hotel on kowloon side as we were there for business./n__label__0 I ended up paying $7 USD./n__label__0 The staff were very helpful throughout the stay./n__label__0 Oh yes my husband also loaded oour luggage./n__label__0 So we proceeded to check in,/n__label__0 We had a nice room on the 25th floor./n__label__0 The rooms are slightly masculine in feel./n__label__0 It is on a one way street and there is no driveway or valet or anything./n__label__0 Parking is terrible, expensive./n__label__0 The service was excellent and we found that the staff went out of their way to accomodate us ,make dinner reservations, give directions, taxi pick-ups, etc.,./n__label__0 A tip for eating in Barcelona - be wary of any of the restaurants on the Ramblas itself./n__label__0 The resort couldnt have been more than 50% full so there was always a shady spot to sit./n__label__0 We got a special deal of 200 euros per night and this made the stay even better./n__label__0 20-25 minutes to Potsdamer Platz./n__label__0 it was so bad some other guests who walked by my husband commented, Hey, we saw you get up and get our own drinks and we were going to ask you to get ours, haha, since you are a better server than anyone working here../n__label__0 The food was spectacular at every restauarant we went to./n__label__0 I cant go into everything in detail, but EVERYTHING was great Want to go back ASAP/n__label__0 Having said that, I would go back./n__label__0 They had so much energy/n__label__0 I never head anything while staying there./n__label__0 On a two night stay that's a big surprise./n__label__0 The staff was unbelievalbly accomodating and attentive to all our needs./n__label__0 Room serviceRoom service needs management./n__label__0 Because I am an inTouch member, a gift of a bottle of water and a bar of chocolate were waiting for me on the nightstand./n__label__0 No apology, no offer of upgrade, no sort of compensation./n__label__0 It is so convenient for shopping and an easy stroll away from the Pike Place Market./n__label__0 Internet is $9.95 per day./n__label__0 Gets noisy in the morning with street cleaners so forget the lie in go to Barneys in Jordaan ,Haarlemerstraaat, for breakfast instead, much more fun ,can I have some more pancakes with extra maple syrup please,./n__label__0 Soap was never replaced during my 5 day stay (they were too small to begin with and I only received one small one for bath and sink)./n__label__0 I was hungry for a bit more than that and ordered eggs and sausage./n__label__0 and jacuzzi were fantastic,/n__label__0 OK the value is good and the hotel is reasonably priced, but the service is terrible./n__label__0 and the room I was given had a single bed (I haven't seen this in hotels for years!) and was smaller than most student accommodation I have seen!/n__label__0 The room did show some signs of wear (nothing major though)/n__label__1 I would highly reccommend a hotel called The Phoenix over this place./n__label__0 The animation team was fantastic./n__label__0 and our last stop was Berlin./n__label__0 They cook up beef, chicken, seafood, cut up veggies and fried rice./n__label__0 but nothing was done./n__label__0 Mostly the sidewalks are being rebuilt./n__label__0 I read that when the hotel was renovated in 2002,/n__label__0 Service was extremely friendly but a little slow./n__label__0 What a place./n__label__0 The brochure and the webside looks fantastic but none of them was there./n__label__0 We bought air mattresses and paddled out in the ocean forever and the water never got rough ,this was summer,./n__label__0 There is a tiny elevator, which is nice if you have a heavy suitcase./n__label__0 So they move us to another room garden view on the 1st floor, dark and smelling very moldy./n__label__0 The staff are all well dressed and well mannered and very professional./n__label__0 Highly reccommend this hotel./n__label__0 We took the train from Schipol to Central Station and then walked the straight road to the hotel./n__label__0 The hotel is lovely - all rooms have balconies and we chose the Executive Suite - lots of space and a lovely bathroom./n__label__0 Will we stay there again-Yes/n__label__0 The upgrade will allow access to free Continental Breakfast and afternoon cocktails./n__label__0 Because I couldn't even get a glass of water or a bottle of water at this hotel, I will look elsewhere for my next stay./n__label__0 We also tried to borrow a movie from the VERY limited DVD collection only to find that the one we wanted and that they thought they had was not in the case and had likely been stolen./n__label__1 Beware of smoking areas for people having breakfast that are very close to non-smoking./n__label__0 We received a lukewarm welcome at check in (early evening) and a very weak offer of help with parking and our luggage./n__label__0 a space heater is included for the cooll evenings as well./n__label__0 Staff Immediate upgrade to larger triple with excellent views./n__label__0 Never again./n__label__0 You enter your desired floor on the keypad OUTSIDE the elevator./n__label__0 We had a studio suite and it was spacious, spotless and nicely equipped./n__label__0 The difference being that if the weather was too soupy to go out, I did not feel cheated stayng in the room relaxing until it cleared up./n__label__0 We found the hotel to be a great location to everything that downtown Seattle has to offer./n__label__0 Everything from our arrival to departure went smoothly./n__label__0 The rooms need a re-do./n__label__0 Do not expect any kind of luxury at Artotel Berlin Mitte,/n__label__0 and we found our selves sleeping on the bare mattress (disgusting) when we woke up in the morning./n__label__0 What it did not have was the requested double bed; instead it had two single beds pushed together with uncomfortable mattresses and tiny duvets./n__label__0 It is on the second floor of a building and really is in great walking distance to the markets, ice cream stores, restaurants, the duomo, uffizi, and the accademia./n__label__0 Plus they are open to 11, perfect after a long day and big dinner./n__label__0 there was nothing they could do./n__label__0 and I think it is just greedy to keep it open but treat it's guests as second class citizens./n__label__0 Unfortunately, the fan settings for the room were either Off or Automatic so it did not help to drown out the city and hotel noise./n__label__0 The small window on the slanted ceiling opened minimally and was of no help./n__label__0 Had a confirmed reservation via hotel website (with a printout in my hand),/n__label__0 We loved our little street-facing room ,the very good windows kept the noise outside, even though it was on the small side, as well as the bathroom and the shower cabin ,overweight people will have problems to take a shower in there,/n__label__0 Internet was one euro every 15 minutes./n__label__0 and the room was either hot from the heater or cold from the draft./n__label__0 Finally, I liked the 3rd floor lobby./n__label__0 Not A Golf Resort/n__label__0 It certainly makes it inconvenient when someone is using the bathroom!/n__label__0 Breakfast available until 10.30 which was also nice./n__label__0 I tried a lot of different dishes and found that most were okay and a few were really good./n__label__0 We also found the location to be very good for sightseeing, shopping, etc as well./n__label__0 My husband and I stayed at the Sofitel New York August 4th-6th./n__label__0 It is noisy on the weekends,/n__label__0 The cost of using the solitary PC in the lobby was extortionate./n__label__0 My husband and I spent 5 days in Florence and 5 in Rome for our honeymoon and I really belabored over picking some good hotels./n__label__0 The nearby restaurants were excellent,/n__label__0 The others were nice and clean... especially liked the one with the pool bar/n__label__0 Breakfast buffet in hotel restaurant had everything you would want to start your day./n__label__0 It wasnt the end of the world since the water dripped into our tub, but it was a bit alarming that the water was coming from a light fixture in the ceiling/n__label__0 There was no bidet in the bathroom which had an awkward toilet cut-off door arrangement/n__label__0 There were plenty of chairs near the pool and we all won at the casino./n__label__0 We loved the beach Bar and julio mayo and Noe./n__label__0 The moment we arrived we knew we made the right choice/n__label__1 This makes me not want to recommend this hotel./n__label__0 Be advised the subway station does not open before 7:15 a.m. on Saturday./n__label__0 THe JW Marriot Gofl Resort in KoOlina./n__label__0 One thing we will remember about the room is that AC was freezing/n__label__0 Staff are friendly and very helpful./n__label__0 We ate at some fantastic restaurants: Tavolata and Union./n__label__0 I had made two reservations: one for the first part of our trip and one for the third leg ,after Olympic Penninsula, but decided to cancel the second reservation./n__label__0 We did not have any problems with AC or moist bedding that some people have complained about./n__label__0 All day tour for about $175 per person, lunch and beer included/n__label__0 The hot has two restaurants, a bar, and a gym./n__label__0 Nice Hotel I just got back from a conference in San Francisco./n__label__0 It looks old and not well kept./n__label__0 but very clean and with a window that could open./n__label__0 The renovated rooms are located to the courtyard and have the same size like the normal rooms./n__label__0 Prices in the restaurant were reasonable for New Orleans./n__label__0 With all lights on, the room was dark; poor lighting except next to the bed; tiny bath with 30x30-inch shower; only one towel until I asked for another; 17 Euro breakfast that was just okay in content; Business Center that was closed of the weekend at 4p on Friday./n__label__0 24 hour snack bar - All they ever had was pizza and popcorn. /n__label__0 Im going back there this year and will definately stay there again./n__label__0 Bathroom nice but on the small size./n__label__0 Mary Jane Rocks at the Magic Castle/n__label__0 It was no bigger than a matchbox/n__label__0 Hyatt failed to take care of us before and after this incident and for that I can never recommend them again./n__label__0 Not once did they smile./n__label__0 The following day my office tried to call and was told that we werent staying there./n__label__0 Singapore is a beautiful clean place and I would have no hesitation in staying at the Golden Landmark on a return visit./n__label__0 My complaints about the hotel: (1) Charging 22 Euros/day for lousy (off/on) internet service is a bit outrageous given the very high room charges, (2) Temperature difficult to adjust in the room (no thermostat),/n__label__0 We also appreciated the size of our room and bathroom---larger than what we have experienced elsewhere in Europe at this rate./n__label__0 To top it off they weren't too apologetic./n__label__0 We were celebrating our 1st yr anniversary and the hotel upgraded our room to a King Premiere and gave us a complimentary bottle of champagne./n__label__0 The shade is provided by the beautiful palm trees./n__label__0 Theres a complimentary breakfast, and I was able to use a courtesy room to shower before my flight./n__label__0 I spent a SLEEPLESS night on a lower floor next to my husband who needed his own bed./n__label__0 The location is perfect, right in the middle of the city, easy to walk anywhere, or hop on transit./n__label__0 Where do I begin./n__label__0 I had a room on the quiet side of the 12th floor./n__label__0 but you only get what you pay for/n__label__0 It was slightly cool outside/n__label__0 Ok the rooms arent decorated to the best of taste, but it added some amusement to our video diary I would stay here again/n__label__0 Our room was an oceanview standard with King bed on the 12th floor./n__label__0 Overall: If you are coming to Seattle on vacation,/n__label__0 Very Good Royal.../n__label__0 The room decor is very comfortable/n__label__0 The food was bascially the same day after day./n__label__0 However, during high season this might not be possible./n__label__0 Hotwire should be embarrassed go carry this hotel./n__label__0 and free shampoo/conditioner is not worth an additional $150+ USD/night./n__label__0 The health facilities in the hotel are good,/n__label__0 This is a really nice little hotel in a great location: theres a subway and Amtrack station 5 minutes walk away./n__label__1 I would stay here again on points of for business, but if it was my own money I might look around before booking it./n__label__0 If you plan on driving, the valet is $8 per day which is comprabable to most 4 or 5 star hotels./n__label__0 but the bathroom was tired and in need of refurbishment./n__label__0 The pod toilet is private enough that you dont feel awkward about utilizing the facility with another person in the room./n__label__0 Back to the hotel./n__label__0 The beds are very comfortable and have more pillows than even I can use/n__label__0 Most drinks are made in kind of a big slushy machine, as opposed to a mixer./n__label__0 He gave us directions  even advised us on portion sizes./n__label__0 When I called to make a reservation for a government conference I was told the hotel was completely sold out./n__label__0 There is nothing really seriously wrong with the hotel,/n__label__0 you wont be disappointed./n__label__0 But, dessert-wise, they had cheesecake, chocolate cake and ice cream./n__label__0 I called the bellman back along with the representative that checked us in and was assured it would be taken care of while we went to get something to eat./n__label__0 and he eats quite a bit./n__label__0 We got into our room at 3pm the bell man took our luggage and drove us to our room in the golf cart./n__label__0 So keep this in mind if you choose to stay here: if, as you look for your room,/n__label__0 The pool was small and most always very crowded./n__label__0 Check in went smoothly,/n__label__0 The staff and in particular, Doreen the acting front desk manager were all superb/n__label__0 Most of the drinks were rum drinks, but you could get other types of drinks on request./n__label__0 In fact, we had to walk to all of our destinations because the Taxi's/n__label__0 The rooms were gorgeous./n__label__0 they gave me the keys of a decent room./n__label__0 The hotel as such was good with a very good breakfast./n__label__0 we were very pleased./n__label__0 The best part about the hotel was the location as it was in walking distance of the Space Needle, The Public Market and for us Qwest Field./n__label__1 Tip, tip, tip and you will not be sorry./n__label__0 I picked this hotel after weeks of reading reviews on this site and others./n__label__0 Room service at breakfast was 1/2 hour late/n__label__0 Because of the large amounts of water, my room flooded, as did many others./n__label__0 The hotel is a five minute walk to the Plaza Espanya metro, but there isnt much in the immediate area in the way of shops, restaurants or tourist attractions./n__label__0 We never got sick thank goodness./n__label__0 The showers were actually very small although there was excellent pressure from the showerhead./n__label__0 Two welcome drinks at their bar./n__label__0 This review could go on forever so I will condense./n__label__0 They said I shouldnt have any problem with the distance since San Fran is a very small city, you can take the bus around./n__label__0 The rooms at the Warwick were nice./n__label__0 Bathroom updated nice./n__label__0 I got there a little too early, as people were still setting up their stalls, but I have never seen such beautiful looking produce and flowers/n__label__0 Opened bathroom door and stepped back from 'strange' smell,/n__label__0 We chose this hotel in part because the rooms feature an outside balcony./n__label__0 It is in a great location - close to Pike Place Market/n__label__0 We have been traveling for the past 15 years to the Carribean and I must say this is one of the nicest hotels we have stayed in./n__label__0 I was here for a week in June,/n__label__0 Read my review and see my photos from that stay./n__label__0 The rest were fine and pleasant./n__label__0 Absolutely fantastic/n__label__0 and one the them had a suspicious rosy mark on it./n__label__0 They are well maintained though ,even if the bathrooms could be helped by a little bleach,./n__label__0 Sofas in room were dirty and damaged./n__label__0 Polite staff./n__label__0 We had an appointment to which we were late,/n__label__0 Lunch Buffet - not enough selection./n__label__0 and the beds took up most of the room./n__label__0 We loved our stay/n__label__0 I walked past the eager young people hoping to get in, feeling grateful those days were behind me/n__label__1 Food in over cooked, at least the water in cafe was drinkable, and don't be fooled by there complimentary newspaper, if you read the sticker the put on it you will see that you will be charged for it to $$$$./n__label__0 but we brought ear plugs anyway./n__label__0 We stayed with our daughters at this downtown Hilton property for three night over the holiday weekend./n__label__0 we had a corner suite so we had plenty of room,/n__label__0 We asked for extra bedding sheets for the kids and they brought them right away, though the next day the maid took them away, and when we called to ask for them again, they brought a whole bed instead - talk about the language barrier/n__label__0 Even though the initial request for extra bedding wasnt made very clearly we were accommodated and looked after properly./n__label__0 There is a lot of sea weed./n__label__0 Also, getting taxis from hotel never took more than 3 minutes when the hotel called, which was rather impressive./n__label__0 and although I didn't get time to drink there - the lobby bar looked really inviting./n__label__0 We had a very large and pleasant room on the 1st floor with a kitchen in a cupboard, a table for 2, a nice wide bed and a bathroom with lots of towels./n__label__0 Maybe because it was on a weekend,/n__label__0 Theyll give you great service regardless of how you do or dont tip but they are not paid very much, work twelve days in a row with three days off in between, and our tips make all the difference./n__label__0 I have found that the Occidental Grand and Bahia Principe chains to be much better./n__label__0 Worth area./n__label__0 Very basic facilities with dated furniture./n__label__0 But they would not give me the government rate even/n__label__0 Bad smell, ugly furniture, bad design, old fahioned, dirty, noisy a/c and not really a heavenly bed I guess./n__label__0 Probably not the best view if you were staying in mid-winter but perfect in the heat of the summer./n__label__0 Secure safe in the room for your valuables./n__label__0 Loved Moskito Boy/n__label__0 Upon seeing my SPG Gold membership card, she checked me in, even though technically Hotwire bookings do not qualify for SPG Gold benefits./n__label__0 The rooms in the old part are described as Classic./n__label__0 and the pillow is virtually non existent/n__label__0 Getting around is easy thanks to the U-Bahn station practically on the doorstep./n__label__1 We highly recommend the Clarendon Hotel and Suites./n__label__0 Good enough, but not that great./n__label__1 However, if you are simply wanting a nice vacation in relaxing area then the Copamarina is a good choice./n__label__0 and new tower were no longer a construction zone,/n__label__1 Most importantly, if you are planning to use the wi-fi internet access, BEWARE./n__label__0 It had a 2 person jacuzzi./n__label__0 Also, the smoke detector in our room was not operational (the device was unhooked and sitting on top of the closet)./n__label__0 Stayed in this hotel 4 nights over Easter 2008./n__label__0 However, only 2 of us stayed at the hotel/n__label__0 I got the feeling that if I didn't get out of someone's way they'd walk into me./n__label__0 The attached restuarant, Lola, served breakfast ,and lunch and dinner, which we did not try,, and seems to be open late./n__label__0 My family and I stayed at the Waikiki Parc for three nights in the beginning of January before heading off to Maui./n__label__0 I tried to get take out coffee from the restaurant,/n__label__0 However, for reference, I stayed at the Seattle Grand Hyatt in January 2005 - that was a fantastic hotel - but costs a lot more too./n__label__0 but don't expect much in the way of character./n__label__0 Perfect location near all the great bars and restaurants, and yet superbly soundproofed so no noise to disturb you if you ever decide to go to bed/n__label__0 On the plus side, hotel does have a GREAT location and is clean./n__label__0 The Moore Hotel is touted as a once grand hotel/n__label__0 Overall we think you get great value for money./n__label__0 The rest of the staff were aloof and didnt really have any concept of customer service./n__label__0 and pleasant staff so they got our business./n__label__0 Just remember: the Moore is a budget hotel./n__label__0 but it seemed quite nice and very popular./n__label__0 but we were on a lower floor with a drab panaroma of the parking lot and some other buildings./n__label__0 but after waiting for 15 mins to get some towels we gave up (a single lady was managing the beauty centre and the whole pool area)./n__label__0 Good location, but there are many other hotels around./n__label__0 Overall I had a great experience at this hotel and if needing to go back, I wouldnt mind staying at this hotel again./n__label__0 A few police/sheriffs officers were present, and very polite and helpful in providing taxi info./n__label__0 I travelled with a friend and stayed at this hotel./n__label__0 Currents can be dangerous and ther are no warnings./n__label__0 The staff at the front desk treated guests like robots./n__label__0 Mike, the manager really does seem to be looking for honest opinions and comments for his hotel./n__label__0 Short walks to K-damm, Savignyplatz, and zoo./n__label__0 It took a telephone call from us to the manager before room service would replace it with the genuine article./n__label__0 Fair enough./n__label__0 A movie at 8pm, a show ,usually a performance of some kind, at 10pm and an on the property disco/sportsbar after the performance./n__label__0 My husband and I just stayed at the Grand Hyatt and loved it./n__label__0 and there were three flights clustered around one very small carousel, hundreds of people jostling and getting angry./n__label__0 The bedroom was a little tight but the living and study space was slightly bigger./n__label__0 You are in another country people./n__label__0 Very nice furnishings, free mini bar, the beer was awful but we enjoyed the water, juice and coke./n__label__0 The rest of the staff was very helpful the remaining days of our stay, but we can never thank Jeff enough for his support that evening./n__label__0 Whatever./n__label__0 They always had smiles on their faces, especially Walter who made everyone around him smile./n__label__0 Personally I would not go back to a Barcelo resort./n__label__0 although not the type I reserved./n__label__0 I fell asleep fast and woke up feeling really well rested/n__label__0 Great Location- ok hotel/n__label__0 I didnt find it quite so fantastic as some of the reviews i read./n__label__0 The rooms are modern and clean./n__label__0 I had no complications at all with check-in or check-out, and I could see the beach from my room./n__label__0 Very energetic and funny./n__label__0 Our room (king bed) was spacious and nicely appointed, very comfortable and with plenty of pillows./n__label__0 I have no real complaints except that the inroom safe had to be paid for on a daily basis which was a little odd (maybe its a German hotel thing)I got a great winter deal on the room but be aware the buffet breakfast (which is very good) is not included in the price and is Very expensive (16 Euros p/p)./n__label__1 Walk 2 to 3 blocks away and get a muffin, coffee, or egg sandwich for about 6 Euros../n__label__0 The room was fine./n__label__0 The loctaion was as good as it gets and overall couldnt be faulted./n__label__0 while we were still in it./n__label__0 Now on to my main complaint./n__label__0 Stayed at the Hilton Times Square 5 nights for a business event./n__label__0 The beds were super comfy and the shower was awesome/n__label__0 The hot tap became very hot/n__label__1 Beware, if you use the Grayline for transportation, allow plenty of time, as they ran up to an hour late./n__label__0 Everything in hotel done on the cheap./n__label__0 I decdied to find another hotel, at a higher rate, and after driving 4 hours on no sleep after working a 12 hour shift./n__label__0 Although there was availability,/n__label__0 but no one was told if this room was an extra room for breakfast./n__label__0 Even refused to call for taxis./n__label__0 (I think), for parking and $12 for internet /per day./n__label__0 The room was wonderfully appointed./n__label__0 The elevators where really really slow, and looked a little shabby./n__label__0 We visited the Bahia Principe next door and were VERY glad we chose the Majestic as their layout is much more preferred./n__label__0 I reported them to Visa./n__label__0 3, There are no bellman so you do have to move your own luggage./n__label__0 They were dark since they were in the back with no view at all but the size of the rooms were amazing./n__label__0 Our room did not face the street./n__label__0 Every single person was friendly, helpful, and genuine./n__label__0 The restaurant on the ground level facing the beach is a bit overpriced, especially for dinner ; the service staff can be a bit surly ./n__label__0 We stayed at Hotel Andra for two nights./n__label__0 Found it as you would expect for a large chain hotel./n__label__0 We recently stayed at the Luna Simone while traveling to London./n__label__0 Just a few tips./n__label__0 With a bit of insistence, she moved us into a 4+-star room./n__label__0 and no-one gave me the wakeup call I asked for./n__label__0 While they made some visible efforts to look for the box -- the fact is that Fedex showed the box signed for,/n__label__0 The next morning ,Saturday, at 7am, I walked accross the street to Starbucks for coffee and then moved the car to the Sutter lot./n__label__0 Needless to say, I will not return./n__label__0 It was about 7 mins away./n__label__0 There are lots of great shops around the hotel./n__label__0 I tried to speak to a manager about this complaint, but was given the brush off./n__label__0 It was an easy walk to Seattle Art Museum and even closer to downtown shopping./n__label__0 The price was alright as well, at least in comparison to other hotels in Seattle..../n__label__0 while they cleaned the room which they had not bothered to do earlier bacause of the check-in mix-up./n__label__0 There are several good restaurants near by./n__label__1 If you are STILL temped to stay at this place: TAKE VERY GOOD EAR PLUGS./n__label__0 The pool was

hardly any view of the ocean at all./n__label__0 The rooms are very TIRED./n__label__0 The inside of the hotel has been recently renovated and is very tasteful./n__label__0 We confirmed it a week or so before our arrival./n__label__1 and if you wanted to take a long stroll you could even walk to the tower./n__label__0 Thanks, tripadvisor, for making reviews available...I did lots of research on-line to get the best place for the best price for our hotel room in New York./n__label__0 We only booked 1 room which was fine as the beds were huge as was the room/suite./n__label__0 If you approach from Lenora St, however, you have to make two lefts to get to the garage which is to the left of the lobby./n__label__0 From that point on my entire impression of the Bryant Park changed from one of disdain to one of admiration for what they are trying to achieve by catering to a wide range of taste levels./n__label__0 Did not go to the Cellar bar, but clearly it attracts quite a crowd./n__label__0 Beds were clean, towels changed each day, no sign of bed bugs ,despite extensive searching on arrival,./n__label__0 I recommend this hotel only if you don't mind blithely throwing money around, and if you bring your own towels./n__label__0 None of us were sick and as far as I know no one else at the resortl was ill./n__label__0 Drinks were great, the trip was relaxing, booked a tour and swam with nurse sharks, stingrays--all in a cage./n__label__0 not as friendly as these posts elude/n__label__0 No attempt was made to look for it./n__label__0 Heres why:The hotel is old./n__label__0 As lots of others have said already, all stuff is great and helpful./n__label__0 and of course the bed was incredibly uncomfortable (same old mattress)./n__label__0 but it has a very nice location./n__label__0 and she was polite was but did not acknowledge the problem until I became very specific about what I expect from a 5-star/n__label__0 The beds we were subjected to were firm to the point of being like sleeping on a sidewalk./n__label__0 It is not that overpriced compared to any full-service hotel./n__label__0 The room had two double beds with lovely bedspreads, nice sheets and great pillows./n__label__0 Having stayed a several all-inclusives throughout Mexico and the Bahamas, the Melia Caribe Tropical was accurately a 5 star./n__label__0 As late June is in the rainy season, the air was quite clean./n__label__0 I thought this hotel would be okay since I was not planning on being in it very often and I really just needed a convenient location to sleep./n__label__0 We had a spacious, well-decorated room./n__label__0 and breakfast buffet was included on the price./n__label__0 Got upgraded to a suite overlooking Victoria Peak, an understandable gesture considering we book all our corporate guests through this place but still appreciated./n__label__0 On reflection, a chest of drawers might be a useful addition to Room 515, but in the scale of things, how minor is that?/n__label__0 A choice of teas was also available./n__label__0 You have to rent the games though./n__label__0 we defintely will try other hotels when we return to berlin next time./n__label__0 I stayed in one of the renovated rooms,/n__label__0 The hotel doesnt have a shuttle so the only other option was a cab which is about $30.The hotel restaurant is adequate but for a really great breakfast walk a block to the Mayflower Park Hotel ,pricey but fabulous,./n__label__0 Sakura Japanese Restaurant -

Republic./n__label__0 and if I ever see another fruit fly it'll be too soon!/n__label__0 This is an upscale business hotel, not a luxury hotel./n__label__0 I booked the hotel online before our trip./n__label__0 but we found it to be very quiet actually./n__label__0 Great hotel Lobby and pretty big hotel with numerous elevators, so you dont have to wait much./n__label__0 There was a little bit if a mix-up regarding my request for a king size bed/n__label__0 Oh yeah- our sheets were dirty too!/n__label__0 The acommodations were simple but very clean with a small fridge and a microwave in the room./n__label__0 I went back to the Westin to pack up and check out./n__label__0 and I found this an inherent problem with German Sofitels./n__label__0 The room was a great room - had a balcony and view of the Boboli Gardens and the Uffizi./n__label__0 I stayed at the Sheraton for four days in May 2005./n__label__0 I really do not understand all the negative comments./n__label__0 even if I had asked for a NS one because I happen to be Spanish/n__label__0 Our room was upgraded to a Deluxe King w/fireplace./n__label__0 If you send packages ahead (as many of us business travelers do) you are charged on a sliding scale based on weight -- that added another $60 to my bill./n__label__1 Walk everywhere./n__label__0 My view ,20th floor, looked west to north and was pretty nice./n__label__0 The bathroom amenities were LOccitane./n__label__0 The rooms are small but very cozy, we would definitely stay here again./n__label__0 We got great deals on both occasions, and could not complain for the price./n__label__0 The suites were spotlessly clean, modern and fully equipped with two bedrooms, two bathrooms, kitchen with some utensils./n__label__0 Many, many thanks to all at the Petite Auberge .. especially, Anna, Mary, Tina, Andy, the day desk clerk whose name escapes me and manager Eric./n__label__0 The front desk staff had a pleasant appearance but did not seem interested in providing any assistance with dining recommendations, transportation, directions, etc. I asked the bellman for directions to a restaurant/n__label__0 I was there for 12 nights and dont have a single criticism of the hotel, except for the crowded breakfast room./n__label__0 I've stayed there four times over the past two or three years and every time I've been,/n__label__0 We would definately stay again./n__label__0 The location was great - we walked everywhere from the hotel./n__label__0 When it opens not sure what will happen to rooftop terrace./n__label__0 Large well equipped bedrooms./n__label__0 After reading ALL of the horrible online reviews of St Vincents Guest House AND hearing a first hand account from a friend who encountered condoms in the hall/stairs, bugs in their bed, urine and other questionable fluids on the walls, we CANCELLED our reservation with several weeks notice./n__label__0 but there is a tram station round the corner./n__label__0 Although most of the reviews of this hotel tell a fairly accurate picture- central, basic./n__label__0 Overall a good expereience./n__label__0 And they are good photos./n__label__0 and the business center was not available because of construction./n__label__0 I chose it because of the positive reviews I read on TripAdvisor,/n__label__0 Despite very careful bookings through our agent Studylink on arrival ,late, with tired students, we found that the hotel had put us in rooms where students were expected to share beds- claiming that this was normal practice./n__label__0 and they seemed to be on a cost-cutting spree here too as they did not replace all the shampoos and soaps daily./n__label__0 and that which is not is easily reached by transit./n__label__0 Quiet for the most part, the room was adequate but could use some minor remodeling./n__label__0 The restaurant staff is wonderful./n__label__0 Rooms needed upgrading badly (and our view was of the roof!) and a good clean!/n__label__0 When we presented our pre-paid reservation through Expedia at the check-in desk, we were told that it wasn't registered./n__label__0 By international standards, the price of the room was very reasonable./n__label__0 We had a gorgeous view of Mt.
