This hotel was very modern and sleek.,0
"Beautiful, well-laid out, albeiit small rooms.",0
"Fantastic breakfast with an incredible selection of meats, cheeses, yogurts, breads etc. And, as a non-German speaker,",0
the staff were uber-helpful.,0
Great location in front of a u-bahn stop.,0
"Our first trip to Berlin, so we were unfamiliar with the city layout.",0
But we were drawn to the design of the Art'otel.,0
"Yes, the public spaces are nicely designed,",0
as are the rooms.,0
But the rooms are small and not very functional.,0
And the location is definitely out of the way (although there is an U-bahn station just a half block away).,0
And we were really put off by the tourist buses and groups.,0
Not really our scene.,0
"If you do end up here, be sure to specify a room at the back of the hotel.",1
The ones on the front are very noisy.,0
"Directly across the street from an informal bus terminus the hotel is also very convenient for the U-Bahn into town and some points in the East on foot, but quite a walk away from the heart of things.",0
"The staff was friendly and tried to be accomodating, but couldn't give me a non-smoking room for the first night, nor an internal room,",0
and I was woken by the early morning firing up of the local bus service (a courtyard-facing room is essential unless you have industrial strength earplugs.)The rooms are small and ill-conceived.,1
Too much attention on 'fabulousness' throughout the hotel (the public spaces are sleek and unwelcoming) and not enough on basic guest comfort.,0
"Having previously enjoyed a great week's stay at the sister art'otel in Berlin (the Warhol-themed City Centre West), we decided to book a 4-night stay at this hotel so we could visit more of the sights on the eastern side of the city.",0
The difference was stark.,0
"This hotel is located in a very quiet district - barely a passing car on a weekday, completely dead at the weekendand with no local facilities.",0
The one bar round the corner had one old pensioner propping the bar up on a Friday evening.,0
The hotel itself is already showing signs of age.,0
"The fixtures and fittings in the room were tired and worn; edges of shelves worn away, carpets badly stained, window blinds torn and damaged.",0
"The room was very much smaller than in the sister hotel,",0
though the bed was amply sized as in all German hotels.,0
Only one almost useless pillow per person though (think no thicker than a cracker) and no availability of additional bed linen as most other hotels would normally provide.,0
The room was effectively air conditioned (i.e. you could control temperature and speed yourself),0
"and this is essential as the hotel's proximity to a very still tributary to the Spree means that the area is plagued by large, voracious mosquitoes.",0
Leaving your bedroom window open is not an option as my heavily bitten body will testify!,0
During my stay I needed to use the internet in order to check-in for our return flight.,0
The cost of using the solitary PC in the lobby was extortionate.,0
"Given the low cost of internet access and PC hardware, all decent hotels now offer such 'business centre' services for free - here,",0
it was a credit card driven system charging 1Euro for 3 minutes online time and extra for every printed page.,0
"As a general tip, if you need to use the internet whilst in Berlin, look up the Easy Internet cafes before you go, there's a huge one in Kurfurstendam",1
and at least one more I saw elsewhere - there access costs 1 Euro for an hour!,0
"Overall, the stay at Berlin Mitte was not what I expected from a hotel chain which calls its most basic room 'Superior'.",0
It needs to decide whether it wants to be 'designer' or just a smart hostel.,0
"For UK travellers, the room was the same size",0
and in the same condition as you'd find in a Travelodge.,0
"If you expect no more than that, you won't be disappointed.",1
"Also, if you're the kind of person who likes to step out of their hotel and straight into the action,",0
this won't ring your bell as all destinations will require at least a half hour walk or public transport journey.,0
"Rooms nices, Staff helpful.",0
"Beds firm, pillows very soft.",0
"No shampoo provided in the room, Shower Gel dispensers don't work well.",0
"Breakfast expensive, supermarket not far, Good value Internet cafe nearby.",0
Close to museum island and U-ban just outside hotel.,0
"Our perfect hotel is one that offers a central location to the attractions we want to see - with spacious, comfortable rooms and good service.",0
"art'otel, Mitte in Berlin definitely fulfilled these requirements.",0
Our room (superior double) was very spacious and extremely comfortable - with a bath for relaxing those tired walking muscles.,0
The onsite restuarant was also excellent - supported by good advice on local eating establishments when we wanted to venture out.,0
The Hotel is less than 1/2 block from the closest U Bhan station - but is situated in a quiet street.,0
"Walking time to many sights (Unter den Linden, Gendarmenmakt, Deutches Museum, Checkpoint Charlie, Nikolaivertel etc. was less than 15 minutes - while virtually everything else was easily accessible by U-Bahn, starting almost next door.",0
Spent 3 nights recently at the Artotel Berlin Mitte.,0
"It was supposed to be a designer hotel,",0
"I have searched for the design,",0
but I haven't found any kind of design in the rooms.,0
"May be the restaurant have something,",0
"but the rooms are poorly decorated, with common furniture.",0
The bed was not very comfortable.,0
In the bathroom there is only liquid soap with two small towels.,0
"Do not expect any kind of luxury at Artotel Berlin Mitte,",0
"it is only a basic hotel, but with a convenient location (50 meters from the metro, 2 metro stations from Alexander platz).",0
The breakfast was good and the staff friendly.,0
We stayed at The Regent in August for two days to celebrate my birthday.,0
"Location.... perfect; staff.... warm, welcoming and professional; room... perfectly appointed; food... sublime.",0
Certainly one of... if not THE best hotels ever!,0
The hotel is ideally located.,0
"If you're a walker, you are close to many attractions.",0
"Room was big, bath was lovely, but watch out for the tile floor after you shower.",1
"No curtains, and water pours off you onto the tile floor which has a drain.",0
Put your towel on the wet floor or you will definitely slip.,0
Desk staff needs to go to a Waldorf class on manners.,0
"Very cold reception, couldn't answer a few simple questions for directions to a few of the sights or an ATM.",0
Room was nice but does need to be vacuumed more frequently than ours was..,0
Pretzels and cookies under the bed.,0
Chair upholstery needs to be cleaned.,0
We turned the cushions over.,0
What a difference..,0
"Don't eat breakfast in the restaurant, too costly.",1
"Walk 2 to 3 blocks away and get a muffin, coffee, or egg sandwich for about 6 Euros..",1
"Liked the room, and the location, but didn't care for the staff of the hotel.",0
Look around the same area for another hotel.,1
Think you can do better.,0
We stayed in the Westin Grand Berlin in July 2007.,0
"In spite of the fact that the reservation we made through the Starwood Hotels website said our rooms would have Westin's renowned Heavenly Beds, we found that only a few suites actually have the beds.",0
The beds we were subjected to were firm to the point of being like sleeping on a sidewalk.,0
"Had we not been told in advance how wonderful our stay would be because of the Heavenly Beds,",0
we might not have been as unpleasantly surprised.,0
The beds and fitness center made it definitely not like a usual Westin stay.,0
The pool was lovely,0
"but the work-out room was small, dimly-lit, and hot.",0
"There were only two treadmills (one of which was broken), a Lifecycle bike, and four computerized weight machines.",0
"There was also one ratty, old floor mat.",0
"Almost everything in Germany had English translations, but not the machines there.",0
"With the highest breakfast prices we've ever seen, it would have been nice to have in-room beverage stations/coffee makers like one usually finds in Westins.",0
There's a fantastic deli across the street where we purchased breakfast for four for half the price of a single continental breakfast at the hotel.,0
The hotel had two positives: the concierge service and the location.,0
The room price was actually pretty reasonable.,0
"This is an upscale business hotel, not a luxury hotel.",0
"The location is great,",0
breakfast was excellent and the beds are fabulous,0
but it lacks character and charm.,0
There was no luggage rack,0
although a call to housekeeping solved this problem.,0
There was only 1 chair,0
and the room was small.,0
This was the last place we stayed after 2 weeks in Germany,0
and it was disappointing to end our trip in a place that was so sterile and impersonal.,0
"The Hotel staff were attentive,",0
"and I enjoyed the location (near Brandenburg, Museum Island, etc), but I wasn't blown away.",0
"I stayed in one of the renovated rooms,",0
and the room itself was quite comfortable--but very small.,0
"My main impression was that the place seemed rather empty, even though I was there during one of the busiest weeks for Berlin tourism (ITB).",0
"If you want a quiet Hotel near tourist sites, this is for you.",0
"If you're looking for that famous Berlin nightlife, look elsewhere.",1
We stayed at The Westin Grand Hotel,0
and it was just fine.,0
We had a great time in Berlin,0
and the hotel served its purpose.,0
"However, it was not spectacular for a few reasons.",0
1. At first we got an unrenovated room.,0
This was not too miserable,0
but we asked to be upgraded in rooms after my back started hurting from the bed.,0
I was under the impression that ALL beds were the so called Heavenly bed,0
and boy were we wrong!,0
"The funny thing is,",0
my husband is usually the one with the back pain!,0
When we changed to a renovated room were were delighted with the bathroom,0
but still stumped at exactly what was so heavenly about the bed.,0
It was hard and REALLY uncomfortable.,0
(We were making jokes about it being left over from the Communist era.,0
"Tee hee hee)2. Terrible smell of sewers down the corridors of hotel although, thankfully not in our room.",0
3. The main conceirge did not give me a warm and fuzzy feeling.,0
He seemed harried and annoyed at me asking too many questions.,0
He recommended the restaurant Stamhouse which is part of the hotel.,0
It was a sportsbar type place,0
and the food was really not good.,0
The main staff of the hotel were all very nice,0
and they had a bunch of baby supplies for us that were helpful.,0
"Not a bad choice, but I wonder if we could have done a bit better...",0
The location is absolutely ideal for a tourist trip to Berlin.,0
"So much is within walking distance,",0
and that which is not is easily reached by transit.,0
"There are restaurants nearby, and plently of shopping.",0
The hotel is a great building.,0
"We too, noticed the sound of the piano player in the evening, but this isn't the worst sound to have wafting into your room!",0
Although I would think they could stop it a little earlier in the evening.,0
Our room was very nicly furnished and clean with a large bathroom.,0
"Our rate inclued and extensive buffet breakfast - VERY nice, with an omlette bar and wide variety of hot and cold foods.",0
I beleive they charge 24Euros for it if it is not included.,0
"I wouldn't pay that, but try to get a rate that includes breakfast!",0
Stayed at the hotel over Easter 2005.,0
This hotel is in two parts the new and the old.,0
The new is 4 star,0
and the old is 2 star.,0
When we arrived we were impressed by the lobby and the friendly staff.,0
When we were shown to our room we were given a twin bedded room in the old part of the hotel.,0
We had booked a double bed.,0
We were moved to a slightly better double room (two beds purshed together) but still in the old part of the hotel.,0
The rooms in the old part are described as Classic.,0
Avoid these rooms - it is very clear why they do not have a photograph of them on their web site.,1
"The rooms are shabby,",0
"the air conditioing did not work (left the balcony door wide open all night in March!), soft furnishings grubby, smelt unpleasant, the toilet broke (still not offered a change of room).",0
"The only positive things to say about the hotel is that it is in a very good location,",0
"the breakfast is excellent, friendly staff and lovely lobby with pianist.",0
Even with these benefits I would not recommend staying in this hotel.,1
I do not know what the quality of the rooms are like in the new part of the hotel.,0
I would certainly never stay in this hotel again.,0
Bit of a dissappointment to be honest.,0
Rooms needed upgrading badly (and our view was of the roof!) and a good clean!,0
The wing where our rooms were had bad smell.,0
When we complained about the smell the staff simply told us to open the windows.,0
Some staff were very nice and helpful,0
and others were not at all.,0
When we mentioned our room hadn't been cleaned one day they simply dumped clean towels in the room and didn't even tidy up!,0
There was also some inconsistency on the service...,0
we were there with family,0
and our room got turned down every night and a free bit of chocolate,0
while the other room never got that...,0
and we all checked in together and paid the same price!,0
Had been warned of a noiseless facelift but was unprepared to battle my way through a foyer of painters,0
and then have to step over debris and rolled up carpets to find the room.,0
Really not worth the money for such a top class hotel.,0
They should have closed for such extensive work,0
and I think it is just greedy to keep it open but treat it's guests as second class citizens.,0
My request to speak to the Manager was ignored as was a letter whilst I was staying there.,0
Would not return as so much choice in Berlin but can say it's situation is ideal for walking to the sights.,0
I stayed at the Westin Grand this past weekend during my trip to Berlin to run the marathon.,0
As a family member of a Starwood Hotels employee I have stayed at many Westin properties,0
and this one was about in the middle in terms of quality.,0
"On the plus side, the location was great.",0
"It is close to public transportation, close to many of the city attractions and close to the start of the marathon.",0
It also was great to have access to the spa and pool before and after the race.,0
I also agree with many posters that the breakfast was great.,0
They also did not charge me for my 7 year old son,0
and he eats quite a bit.,0
"On the negative side, was the fact they did not change towels on one day",0
and only stocked the bathroom supplies once for a 3 night stay.,0
"Additionally, room service for a pot of coffee took 1 hour.",0
I stayed in an unrenovated room with a view out the window onto Fredrichstrasse.,0
This was nice since I could see a portion of the race route and could watch roller bladers,0
and runners go by from my window.,0
Overall the stay was just above neutral.,0
I stayed at the Westin Berlin 3 or 4 times.,0
This time I stayed for two nights,0
and they gave me a room upgrade to a renovated room.,0
Renovated?,0
"Yes, they call it renovated.",0
The renovated rooms are located to the courtyard and have the same size like the normal rooms.,0
"Bad smell, ugly furniture, bad design, old fahioned, dirty, noisy a/c and not really a heavenly bed I guess.",0
Forget about the rooms in this hotel!,0
"Still, the location is the best",0
and the lobby is very pritty and impressive.,0
"But the rest of the hotel, forget about it.",0
Also the food at Friedrichs is boring and very traditional.,0
"If you have the chance, go for the brand new Radisson, Hyatt, Marriott or Adlon.",1
My wife and I stayed two nights at this hotel at the end of February.,0
"The carnival was in full swinging in Berlin, but not in this hotel.",0
"Granted, as you enter the lobby you feel that you are entering into a great hotel.",0
"The lobby is beautiful and has a luxurious feel, with a loveably staircase,",0
but the luxury ends right there.,0
"The schizophrenic state starts as you begin walking to your room, what an awful smell in the corridor.",0
I concur with previous reviews;,0
I felt I was walking through a sewer.,0
Then you enter the room.,0
"A twin bedded room, and I mean twin and small beds.",0
Really separate beds.,0
"Request for change was denied, notwithstanding my Starwood card.",0
No heavenly pillows; no heavenly beds; and no heavenly comforters here.,0
I felt I was staying at a **star hotel room.,0
Then you enter the bathroom.,0
It must have been decorated by the owner of a hospital.,0
"It was all white, with no goodies.",0
"I accept, however, that we had a balcony and a great view unto the Unter den Linden, but that was it.",0
"In conclusion, this is no *****star hotel.",0
"If you get a great rate per night, like I did using a voucher system, is OK, but otherwise stay elsewhere.",1
I stayed at the Grand Westin several times.,0
"If you get a deluxe room (yes, you are right: deluxe room) you will hate this hotel.",0
Lobby and location is perfect.,0
Service is so so.,0
I'm a Starwood Platinum Member and they didn't upgrade me!,0
They said it was a congress like Berlinale or so.,0
"The rooms are so old fashioned, stinky and noisy.",0
Bathrooms are even worse.,0
Dont go for the pictures on the starwood internet site.,1
"In reality, rooms look different!",0
(and much worse!!),0
"The best thing about the Westin, as everybody has already stated, is the location.",0
"But, this is not the only hotel in the area - The Hilton is just a few blocks away as are a few others that are in the 5 star range.",0
The big problem for me was the fact that the rooms have an ever present sewer smell that hits you as soon as you walk in the room.,0
"I was prepared for this as many of the reviewers have mentioned it, but still, it is unacceptable.",0
"I was staying here with my Starwood Points,",0
"so the room and breakfast were included in the award,",0
but my points are valuable,0
and I felt like I wasted them on this hotel.,0
"A curious thing for me was, when I walked outside the hotel, every so often, from Friedrichstrasse to the Brandenburg Gate,",0
that same awful smell would drift by.,0
My take on it is that the sewer system put in by the GDR needs to be replaced.,0
"Bottom line: pick another hotel, the Starwood Group has a white elephant on their hands with this smelly grand hotel.",1
We had a small trip to Berlin this spring and choosed this hotel because it is easy to reach and in the heart of berlin.,0
"Breakfast is one of the best I ever had,",0
but you have to wait quite a long time to get seated in this small and crowded breakfast room.,0
"As this is a quite large luxury hotel, the rooms are really small.",0
"The room we got was nothing special, small, clean, thats it.",0
"Overall the hotel is quite ok,",0
but I had better ones.,0
Just returned from a Great 3 night stay at the Westin on a fantastic priceline deal.,0
I would agree with earlier reviews that this hotel doesn't quite make the 5 star status it claims but is a very good 4 star property.,0
The hotel is located in the former East Berlin and is well placed for most of the sights.,0
Getting around is easy thanks to the U-Bahn station practically on the doorstep.,0
"The public areas are very grand especially the lobby with its huge atrium, sweeping staircase and piano player.",0
Couldn't notice any strange smells in the lifts as mentioned by a previous poster.,0
Bedroom was standard size and decorated in classic style.,0
The room did show some signs of wear (nothing major though),0
but a refurbishment programme is in progress (we had a note apologising for any noise heard though we did not hear any).,0
The beds were as promised Heavenly with a pillow that could be moulded to suit any height preference.,0
The bathroom whilst adequate was a rather basic white tiled room which didn't quite match the granduer of the bedroom and public areas.,0
Everything worked well though,0
and there was a good selection of bathroom products.,0
Staff were at all times exceptionally courteous and polite.,0
Breakfast was not included,0
and at __�_13 overpriced as was the bottle of water strategically placed in the room at __�_4.50. All in all I have no real complaints about the hotel and would have no problems in recommending it.,0
If you are lucky enough to be awarded the hotel through priceline it really is a fantastic bargain.,0
My husband and I stayed at the Westin for three nights.,0
We had booked a non-smoking room but were given a smoking room instead.,0
"Our room was down a long corridor with three dead lightbulbs, which we pointed out but were not replaced during our stay.",0
As soon as I arrived I went to wash my hands,0
and I the head of the tap came off.,0
The fridge door became unhinged as soon as I opened it.,0
"This would have been funny were it not because we were on a rare break and, in addition, the room was tired, smelly, had a stained carpet and a stained armchair.",0
The net curtains had not seen a washer in a long while.,0
The sheets were not changed for three days,0
and one the them had a suspicious rosy mark on it.,0
"However, the worst thing was the level of service (or rather the complete lack of it).",0
We were not given another room and had to wait until the next day for the tap and fridge to be fixed.,0
I asked for the sheets to be changed three times,0
"and I was told they would be,",0
but it never happened.,0
Reception staff were plain rude,0
"and even the manager told me (I still can't believe I heard this) that they had given us a smoking room,",0
even if I had asked for a NS one because I happen to be Spanish,0
and most Spanish people smoke!,0
We tried the pool to relax ouserselves,0
but after waiting for 15 mins to get some towels we gave up (a single lady was managing the beauty centre and the whole pool area).,0
"The following day we were lucky with the towels, but found the poolside furniture dirty,",0
We were never given any apologies or signs of regret for the shortcomings we had to deal with.,0
A frustrating and depressing experience.,0
I had to pinch myself to believe it was actually happening.,0
I stayed at the Westin in mid september after having stayed there in 2005.,0
I have always like the location and was very impressed with the recent improvements.,0
The room was great with a modern updated decor.,0
"Most importantly, the staff were very helpful and friendly.",0
This had not been the case in 2005 when folks seemed cold...,0
so I really highly recommend.,1
"Let's have a round of applause, please, for the Westin Grand, for taking discount bookings to a new low.",0
"I have long suspected that hotels reserve the smallest room, the one with the worst view, or the one by the elevator, for guests who pay a discounted rate ...",0
"but never before have I been offered a dirty, smelly room and then upcharged for a ""renovated"" (i.e. clean) room.",0
"So keep this in mind if you choose to stay here: if, as you look for your room,",0
"you come to the end of a regular-looking hotel corridor, pass through a lounge, and into a narrow, dark and musty corridor with doorways just about your height and barely wide enough to fit your carry-on luggage ... well,",0
you have been given a discount special!,0
"Turn around immediately and return to the front desk, where you will be charged an extra 30 Euros per night for a ""renovated"" room that, upon inspection, hasn't been renovated anytime in recent memory, but is at least cleaner and does not smell.",0
"Our first room was very small, the upholstery and lampshades(!) were stained, the furniture desperately needed to be refinished,",0
"and it had a very strong, musty odour (mould perhaps?) At the front desk we were told that because they were fully booked, they could only offer us another room in the same grade, or a ""renovated"" room for an extra 30 Euros per night.",0
(Fully booked?,0
But they could still find a better room for an additional fee?,0
"I'm not sure that I follow that logic, but whatever.) After our overseas flight we really didn't feel like arguing, so we just paid the extra - no way to say now if the other room in the same grade would have been acceptable.",0
"The second room, pictured here, was much better.",0
"It was larger, cleaner and updated (though the washroom was clearly not renovated, as I've noted in my pictures).",0
"I would have been perfectly happy if we had been offered this to begin with, and would have given the hotel a higher rating,",0
but I consider our treatment unacceptable.,0
"Having said that, I still ranked this hotel a 2 rather than a 1 because the breakfast buffet was fantastic, and the location was very convenient for sightseeing.",0
"The room service was also quite good, and the staff friendly and (for the most part) helpful.",0
I haven't stayed at too many nicer hotels.,0
Nor would I generally spend over 300 Euros for a hotel (thankfully my Mom was paying for this stay).,0
"At the risk of sounding like a line from ""Cabaret,"" everything about this hotel is beautiful.",0
The lobby is beautiful.,0
The restaurants are beautiful.,0
The rooms are beautiful.,0
The pool and gym are are really beautiful.,0
Even the breakfast is a feast for the eyes (as well as the stomach).,0
We ate at both restaurants.,0
"The Trader Vic's puts our Trader Vic's here in Emeryville to shame, both with respect to decor and food quality.",0
"The German restaurant, Mark Brandenburg, simply had the best German food I've ever had (and I've been to Germany about 8-9 times).",0
One needs to swipe ones room cards in order to access the floor rooms.,0
The pool/gym area is open 24 hours/day.,0
"As a Gold HHonors member, we received an upgraded room, which was very quiet, comfortable, and large, but had no view (windows open to an inner courtyard).",0
"My complaints about the hotel: (1) Charging 22 Euros/day for lousy (off/on) internet service is a bit outrageous given the very high room charges, (2) Temperature difficult to adjust in the room (no thermostat),",0
"and we couldn't get it quite cool enough for comfort, (3) Rather thin towels for a luxury hotel, (4) Needless step to the beds; great for tripping on (especially for an older person such as my mother).",0
"So a very nice hotel, albeit not a great value.",0
I would go here if money were of no object (and not otherwise).,0
"We stayed at Hilton Berlin in early June, 2006.",0
"We are Diamond HHonor memebers,",0
so were upgraded to executive room on the executive floor.,0
"The room is average looking, with motel style bedspread and decrative pillows.",0
"underneath the bedspread, there are 2 twin comforters, which is wierd for a queen room.",0
"Bathroom is average looking too, with mold smell.",0
concierge not helpful and very unfriendly.,0
executive floor representitives are cold too.,0
"we stayed at many hiltons worldwide,",0
"we feel this is a below average hilton, especially for it's service.",0
we defintely will try other hotels when we return to berlin next time.,0
Hilton - stay on executive floor (great lounge) get a room overlooking the Gendarmenmarkt (beautiful day and night).,1
They also have a nice pool and spa,0
"but the children at all hours in the pool will drive you to the nudist spa area, which is pretty nice and child free.",0
There are several good restaurants near by.,0
We loved the eastern sector location with it's delightful walking areas and proximity to museum island and gorgeous neo-classical architecture.,0
The Potsdammer Platz is very times square with it's glass and steel highrises and heavy traffic.,0
The rooms are very comfortable - typical Hilton decor - nice sheets and good showers.,0
The concierge was very helpful with local restaurants.,0
"The lounge had a great breakfast and offered drinks through the day including wine, etc. at evenings with appetizers.",0
"Stay - 4 nights / 4 days. Location _��_ Located just off the Gendarmenarkt (square that has the concert hall, and the German and French Cathedrals).",0
"Easy walk to the Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag and Check point _���_Charlie_���.",0
"Room _��_ Room was OK,",0
"we had a corner suite so we had plenty of room,",0
and bathroom was typical smallish hotel fare.,0
"Food _��_ Breakfast _��_ Only had breakfast on the last day _��_ good spread, fresh and presented well.",0
"Dinner at Trader Vics _��_ Again OK, it was nothing to write home about.",0
We had much better meals at the surrounding cafes/restaurants.,0
"Staff _��_ Reception desk staff were fine,",0
"the concierge that we went to see about finding a laundry mat was a bit of pain in the rear,",0
"he sent us to the right suburb but the wrong street,",0
it was around the corner and across the road.,0
Overall _��_ This is a typical businessman_��_s / conference hotel.,0
"Anyone looking for something a little bit special should look elsewhere,",1
its location was it_��_s main attraction to us.,0
Stayed at the 5 Star Hilton Berlin for two nights to experience the Christmas Markets and celebrate my friends birthday.,0
We we allocated room 5088 which looked over an internal courtyard so very quiet but no view.,0
Most importantly the room appeared clean and well maintained.,0
The size of the room was adequate,0
but the luxurious touches I would have expected from a hotel of this standard were in my opinion poor.,0
"There were robes (not very large, soft or fluffy) and slippers, small, thin towels (in fact my friends had to share a towel).",0
King size bed (plus added squeaky springs) with two single duvets.,0
Minimal tea  coffee (one cup per day) and mini bar.,0
The room also had ironing facilites.,0
There was a pool and spa,0
but I don't have experience them.,0
With last minute it was room only so no idea what the breakfast was like.,0
The redeeming point was the hotel's location which was superb.,0
If you can get a room at a good price I would stay here,0
but if paying rack rate there are other hotels with far superior facilities available in Berlin,0
"Hotel is well-situated near main attractions, restaurants and shopping.",0
"Room was clean, well furnished and serviced promptly.",0
The room air conditioning had a hard time keeping up with the warm temperatures in Berlin.,0
The restaurant (Mark Brandenburg) was over-priced and had marginal food.,0
The hotel was overrun with meetings and groups.,0
"There was an unexplained,",0
additional Hotel charge of 8 Euros that appeared on my credit card statement.,0
"I challenged the charge in an e-mail to the hotel, and followed up with e-mails to the Hotel (twice), HiltonHonors and Hilton corporate.",0
None of these Hilton entities have had the courtesy of even responding (no less reversing this charge) in over a week.,0
"Stayed in a standard room - clean,quiet and very comfortable.",0
Hotel amenities were excellent.,0
Staff very friendly.,0
Restaurants - food great and a nice selection.,0
It is in a very good location - tube stop right outside or walking distance to Checkpoint Charlie.,0
A great choice!!,0
Stayed here for four nights.,0
We upgraded to a room with a view of the Gendarmenmarkt for 20 euros a night.,0
The room is avarage in size.,0
Double bed quite narrow and not as comfortable as expected.,0
Bathroom nice but on the small size.,0
"Breakfast was included in our deal,",0
yet each morning they asked for our signature as on their records it appeard as if our breakfast was exclusive.,0
I would have assumed that after their first mistake they'll sort their records but it never happened.,0
Unfortunately i fell ill on our last day there.,0
I sent my husband to get me an Aspirin until we buy one at a pharmacy.,0
They couldn't spare us one and said they didn't have any.,0
Is this the Hilton?,0
There is no turndown service as well.,0
"Apart from all the above the location is great, central and quite.",0
Breakfast is delicious and plentiful.,0
I believe the hotel is best for business clientle.,0
"We, a Scottish couple, decided to visit Berlin for four days and after reading positive reviews regarding the location of the Hilton,",0
we decided to opt for that.,0
"On our arrival, we discovered that the hotel had overbooked",0
and that there was to be no room there for our first night.,0
We were a bit annoyed because the location of the hotel had been our primary reason for booking.,0
We were asked to have one night in the Intercontinental and come back to the Hilton for the remainder of our stay.,0
The Intercontinental was fine,0
and on our return to the Hilton I have to say that the staff could not do enough for us.,0
"We had a room upgrade and a variety of gifts, free dinner, etc, to apologise for our inconvenience.",0
"The staff and in particular, Doreen the acting front desk manager were all superb",0
and truly went out of their way to make our stay more special.,0
"Breakfast choice was great,",0
"only slight criticism was the room where you have breakfast,",0
"sort of reminded me of a works canteen but that aside,",0
choices were good and plenty of food available.,0
"Overall, you could do a lot worse than to go to the Berlin Hilton as the location is absolutely spot on for the underground,",0
shopping and sightseeing and of course at this time of year there are a few Christmas markets within walking distance.,0
"All in all, we had a great time.",0
We found it worn and noisy.,0
Is a remodel in the future?,0
Prices reflect what you get.,0
You may be well advised to try another address...,1
We stayed at the Hilton for two nights at the beginning of December.,0
"The hotel is well place in the city, with a U-Bahn station right outside the door;",0
this makes everywhere very easily accessible.,0
"We were also right next to one of the Christmas markets, which was handy.",0
The hotel itself is fine;,0
"it is a fairly typical four star hotel, without any features to really set it apart from the rest.",0
"The lobby is grand in it's size, and is quite impressive.",0
"We were given a smoking room,",0
and the staff were happy to move us to a less smelly non-smoking room when we asked.,0
"Throughout the stay the hotel staff were all very helpful and polite, and of course all spoke excellent English - as usual compounding my misery at being uni-lingual!",0
Our room was clean,0
and of a good size and the bathroom was very nice.,0
The minibar was well stocked and priced at the usual OTT rate!,0
"The swimming pool and gym were both excellent,",0
although I still cannot quite believe they charge 11 Euros for a Sauna...,0
"Breakfast was excellent, with a very good selection of food and very good service.",0
"The hotel restaurants looked nice,",0
but we did not try them.,0
Probably my main criticism with the hotel is it's size - the hotel is very big and somewhat impersonal.,0
"Checking out at 10.55 on Sunday was not a good plan, as all six queues for reception were enormous - this could of course have been avoided by getting up earlier or doing express check out.",0
"The last time we stayed in Berlin (June),",0
"we stayed at the Ritz Carlton  paid a similar price to the Hilton; on our next visit we will certainly go back to the Ritz Carlton, as it is that bit more special.",0
Stayed 3 nights in March.,0
All amenities associated with a good business hotel at an above average level.,0
"Excellent fitness room, though I did not use the spa/pool.",0
"Great location, a short walk to shopping  many popular points of interest (e.g. Brandenburg Gate, Reichstag, museums, checkpoint charlie).",0
U-bahn station directly in front of hotel for easy transport to attractions farther west.,0
Note breakfast and 24-hours of Internet use were an extra 22 euro each.,0
"Just returned from Berlin, Germany and the Savoy Hotel was quite nice.",0
Be prepared that most Berlin hotels do NOT have air conditioning!,0
The Savoy only has room suites on the 6th floor with air conditioning.,0
We upgraded directly with the hotel.,0
Our suite was decorated tastefully with Chagall prints and very comfortable.,0
The hotel's cleanliness is superb.,0
"The 6th floor however, is NOT non-smoking;",0
"I was concerned about this, but it wasn't an issue.",0
"They have a wonderful hot breakfast buffet that was included in our stay,",0
the dining room is elegant!,0
I would certainly stay there again.,0
"The staff was very pleasant,",0
and the location was perfect.,0
I booked the hotel online before our trip.,0
++++,0
Christmas in Berlin was a wonderful experience here.,0
Little gifts everyday of our stay made it easier to be away from home during the holiday.,0
A huge decorated Cristmas tree and poinsettias in the lobby was enhanced by the deep red walls and wallpaper and crystal chandeliers.,0
Elegant 1920's furnishings made the lobby a comfortable place to relax after museum hopping with a drink and a book while watching the world bustle by outside the window.,0
The German staff was attentive to our requests without exception.,0
Complimentary bottles of water and chocolates daily was good,0
and the mini poinsettia and tin of chocolates made us smile.,0
We enjoyed the ease of proximity to museums and good restaurants.,0
A cigar bar off the lobby worried us until we discovered it did not offend our non-smoking sensibilities.,0
"The bathroom here was spacious, but a disabled person (me) would have trouble with the very deep tall tub.",0
"Another comfortable chair in the room, there's one, would be a plus We only ate one breakfast here because we slept in, but its a bit expensive.",0
A croissant and coffee around the corner was convenient and good at half the price.,0
There are abundant taxis here,0
but the U-bahn is cheaper and gets you most everywhere.,0
Had a great stay in Berlin in May.,0
"Everything about the hotel was good,",0
while the location was great.,0
"Short walks to K-damm, Savignyplatz, and zoo.",0
Enjoyed the hospitality and helpfulness of the Savoy Berlin staff.,0
"Staff gave accurate restaurant and transportation recommendations,",0
and dry cleaning was performed timely and skillfully.,0
Enjoyed the size of the room and bathroom.,0
"But I was quite surprised at the decor of the room - seemed like it hadn't been updated since the 80's. But to us, this didn't matter.",0
"Space, cleanliness, large functional bathroom, and new bed made up for the somewhat odd decor of the room.",0
Also liked the nice touch of having a bottle of mineral water in the room.,0
Comfortable large and clean.,0
Recommended.,0
The Savoy is a very nice hotel with antique furniture but still a kind of trendy look.,0
Rooms are very spacious,0
but most bathrooms are in urgent need of remodelling (the existing ones are dating back to the 60s!).,0
The staff is very friendly and efficient.,0
The only real downside of this hotel is its bar: It is a cigar bar,0
and there are always some people inside smoking cuban cigars which makes the air inside unbearable.,0
"Sometimes, the smoke is drifting through the lobby and makes the whole place very unpleasant.",0
"There is no non-smoking section in the bar and quite frankly, if you are not a smoker yourself,",0
it is better to avoid the bar.,1
They do serve drinks upon request in the lobby and you better ask them to do so.,1
Breakfast is great.,0
I stayed Savoy for two nights.,0
The location is really convenient to use any public transport (400m from Zoo Station)and two blocs away from KUFUDAMM.,0
The front desk was always polite as well as effieicent.,0
"The room decor was a classy, and yet cosy.",0
very good after a long walking day in Berlin.,0
My single room has a huge bathroom and a balcony.,0
Some previous reviewers complained about the smoke released from the Cigar bar.,0
It was not too heavy in my room since I aksed for non-smoking one.,0
"Breakfest is average, It did have a good selection",0
but a bit pricey 19euros since you can have a decent breakfest in any Kaffee in Berlin.,1
I do recommand Kaffee Einstein.,1
"Overall, I will stay Hotel Savoy again for my next Berlin trip for its location and service.",0
"If you're a non-smoker, don't stay here!",1
Although I was on the nonsmoking floor(5th) both the hallway,0
and my room smelled of smoke.,0
Why?,0
The door of the cigar bar on the ground floor is left open,0
and the smoke wafts through the hotel.,0
Housekeeping leaves your windows open to air it out.,0
One evening I returned to my room to find both windows open.,0
The rooms need a re-do.,0
The hotel was remodeling the 6th floor,0
while I was there.,0
"Also, as it's near the Zoo rail station and the windows are not double-paned you will here trains all the time.",0
The location is great.,0
The restaurant staff is wonderful.,0
The front desk staff was great during the week,0
but the weekend front desk staff can be rude.,0
Next time I'd stay at the more modern Ku'damm 101(owned by the same owners) or the Kempinski Bristol down the block.,0
I had a mixed experience in relation to this hotel.,0
Overall found most of the hotel staff to be very responsive  helpful.,0
"We also found the location to be very good for sightseeing, shopping, etc as well.",0
I did however find the following to be very disappointing:,0
The bed was very uncomfortable  old,0
"The air conditioning was turned off, even though it was cold outside our room was as hot as a sauna.",0
The only option was to have the window open all of the time which made sleeping impossible due to noise from the street below.,0
"The bathroom was very dated  disappointing, in particular I could not believe the shower was in a 5 star hotel.",0
"Bathroom hairdryer is impossible to style your hair with,",0
it took me 4 calls to the concierge before an alternative was provided.,0
Sometimes the staff on the concierge desk spoke almost no English which was frustrating.,0
"I am a very frequent traveller,",0
"I would not rate the hotel experience we had as 5 star, something on par with a 3 or 4 star but certainly not 5 star.",0
We stayed at this hotel because it was near to K'damn,0
and this was our first trip to berlin.,0
We had a standard room on the lower floors overlooking the central courtyard.,0
Probably not the best view if you were staying in mid-winter but perfect in the heat of the summer.,0
The room was spotlessly clean.,0
The bathroom was spacious and immaculate also with the novelty of having a speaker system built in allowing you to listen to the TV while in the bath.,0
A turn down service also added a little more luxury.,0
"The spa was great, just what we needed after the hot weather we'd had.",0
Be warned if you are a bit of a prude as most guests are followers of the naked spa regime!,0
Breakfast was fantastic.,0
Everything you could imagine from cereals to freshly made pancakes with maple syrup(recommended).,0
The lobby and cocktail bar were a lovely touch and very relaxing.,0
"K'damn is just across the road, as is the Berlin zoo on the opposite side.",0
Both a great day out.,0
Also the tour bus goes from just outside one of the many HMs located on the K'damn.,0
Tiergarten is great for a leisurely wander in the evening.,0
If you're lucky you might just come across a great beer garden near the spanish?,0
embassy which sells pizza and 2 huge litre glasses of beer for 15 euro.,0
Follow the collection of bikes down to this beautiful area by the lake.,0
Once again beware the naked berliners (conservative Irish person speaking) in the park and also the mosquitos!,0
I chose the Palace hotel after doing quite a bit of research on Berlin Hotels.,0
The time was well invested,0
and I have to report that we were very satisfied with the Palace.,0
"It is 5 minutes walk wheeling our bag from Zoo Station, where we came into Berlin from Schoenfeld Airport.",0
"The hotel is modern, clean (very) business hotel,",0
but there were some tourists like us as well.,0
"Lobby large, sometimes a bit of music, comfortable.",0
"Staff are very helpful, attentive, smiling and say hello to you in the morning.",0
"Bedroom- we had taken a slight upgrade room on the 5th Floor was spacious, well equipped.",0
bathrooms are really nice marble and glass.,0
So clean and fresh everywhere.,0
They were redecorated in May 05 - so carpets etc. all virtually new.,0
Very nice.,0
Tried the spa- which has everything .,0
"Only comment I would make - apart from it being all one would expect, is that I nearly slipped twice on the tile floors around the pool",0
and sauna area- they are dangerous.,0
"I was however given some hotel slippers and a robe (after I asked, not on entry).",0
You must use these or risk breaking your leg.,1
Cost was on an excellent deal only EU.,0
605 for four nights.,0
Which for this hotel was very good value.,0
YOu do have to shop around on the newt to get best deal.,1
"I got mine from Bookings, which had the advantage of not taking all your money up front on a no cancel deal (like some of the others try to do...) Hotel is well placed for Shopping, busses and U S Bahn lines.",0
"Travel for some distance in Berlin is unavoidable since it is so spread out,",0
that it hardly matters where you stay in the city-,0
but this was particularly central.,0
Just one otherword of advice- and not about the hotel.,0
We travelled back to london on a Saturday evening.,0
Got into Luton at 10.35pm by Easyjet.,0
We arrived at the car part (mid term 5 mins from Terminal) at 12 midnight.,0
Easyjet do not arrange for offloading facilities on a Saturday evening,0
"and there were three flights clustered around one very small carousel, hundreds of people jostling and getting angry.",0
Easyjet probably blame groundstaff.,0
Groundstaff couldn't care less.,0
Its Easy's responsibility.,0
Definitely avoid travelling by Easyjet at weekend late evenings!,1
"I doubt they have the capacity at that time to run a bath, never mind an airline -with hundreds of passengers wanting to go home and not wanting to wait as long as the flight time from berlin to get to the car park.",0
Angry -yes.,0
But otherwise it was a very interesting four days. Distances in Berlin are vast,0
and the underground or bus often drop you about a half a mile or more from your target destination.,0
Worth a taxi sometimes...,0
One more thing- if you want to visit the Bundestag it is a good idea to book a tour (in english) in advance.,1
That way you avoid the queues and walk right in like an expected guest- free tour excellent.,0
Good areas to eat in the evening is around Hackescher Markt in the Hof complex on Oranienburger Str.,0
and further upo the same street towards the synagogue direction.,0
Lots of good eating places.,0
Best breakfast place we found (but there are many) was in Fasanenstrasse No.,0
23 (Garden and conservatory part).,0
BUt it is about 15 mins from Hotel.,0
Once or twice is ok.,0
Otherwise there ar places nearer.,0
We didn't take the Hotel breakfast at 20 Eu each.,0
Why so dear??,0
Stayed here for a conference and would not advise it for people with other options.,1
Room was decent size for a European hotel,0
but there were also many negatives.,0
Furnishings were dated and floors were dirty.,0
The hotel phone system was down for three days. Staff was rude.,0
The front desk tried to charge me an extra day that I had cancelled upon check-in - this was a 30 minute hassle.,0
"The location is okay for but for better restaurants and sight-seeing, stay closer to Postdamer Platz or Mitte.",1
My wife and I spent 3 nights at the Palace Hotel in Berlin.,0
The location of the hotel is right on Kurf��__rstendamm and very close to the Zoo and Ged�__nknich kirsche.,0
We stayed in one of the renovated rooms after recommendation from Tripadvisor.,0
This was a good recommendation.,0
We had a direct view over the zoo and to the Fernsehturm.,0
The room is modern and has a good size.,0
The beds are rather hard.,0
The hotel has a high standard: There is a good pianoplayer in the bar area at night.,0
The service from the staff is more than excellent.,0
They certainly live up to the standard of The leading hotels of the world.,0
The only minus is the additional costs.,0
Internet Connection is rated to 22 Euros per night which is very high.,0
The prices in the bar are approx.,0
50% more expensive than in a restaurant.,0
The pool area is fantastic,0
but the pool was rather cold and we therefore only used it once.,0
You have to pay to use the sauna area.,0
If you go to this hotel don`t book a standard room.,1
The room was ok,0
but the bathroom was tired and in need of refurbishment.,0
The shower was in the bath with the shower head hooked up.,0
"This swivelled about when turned on, making it difficult to stand under.",0
"There was no thermostat, just a hot and cold mixer tap.",0
I had a nasty fall when the shower suddenly became very hot.,0
I would not recommend this hotel.,1
One of the reasons why there appears to be a difference of opinion regarding the star rating for this hotel is possibly because the hotel is made up of two distinct blocks.,0
Half of Palace Hotel has been renovated recently and consists of contemporary landings and bedrooms/suites.,0
The other block (directly above the main entrance) is still trapped in the 1970's time warp that's been mentioned by previous contributors.,0
Unfortunately I ended up in the latter half!,0
"Whilst the room was indeed large, clean and functional it lacked the finishing touches that one expects from 5-star accommodation.",0
"The service at the hotel was reasonable,",0
though I did find the concierge to be particularly unhelpful.,0
However one of the redeeming features of the Palace Hotel is its location.,0
The hotel can be reached from Tegel Airport by catching the X9 or slower 109 bus and getting off at the last stop (Zoologischer S+U Bahn).,0
Close to the hotel are the 100,0
and 200 bus routes which pass all the major tourist sites - a far better option than taking a tourist bus.,0
The hotel is situated in the only area of the city that has not seen major redevelopment in the past 20 years.,0
"However it is in close proximity to the major shopping street (Ku_��_damm) and other tourist attractions (e.g. the Zoo, Aquarium, Kaiser Wilhelm Church, the Ka-De-We Dept Store).",0
"If you are going to be making use of the fantastic public transport across Berlin, then this hotel is an ideal (though slightly expensive) base from which to explore this amazing city.",0
"The Restaurants in the hotel are okay, though if not eating in the hotel I would advise you to look further a field as the restaurants/caf�_�_��_s close by are not particularly good.",1
The exception is the 7th floor restaurant at the Ka-De-We.,0
"The health facilities in the hotel are good,",0
though the swimming pool was a bit short for my liking.,0
"However the staff is helpful and provide you with towels, dressing gown and sandals (to avoid you slipping on the floor).",0
The spa facilities are also nice but cost an extra __�_7 per day.,0
"For those looking for things to do whilst in Berlin, I would highly recommend the walking tours offered by Original Berlin Walks (Discover Berlin) and Sandemans New Berlin (Red Berlin Tour and the Free Tour).",1
"The Reichstag Dome, TV Tower at Alexanderplatz, and Pergamon Museum are all worth a visit.",0
The Intercontinental in Berlin was highly disappointing to my fiance,0
and I. I was excited when we first checked in because the lobby is very grand and fairly well appointed.,0
The staff seemed nice enough and helpful.,0
The true disappointed came when we checked into the room.,0
The rooms are very TIRED.,0
The carpet from the 1970's has blue bows on it and looks like something from your grandmother's house.,0
"The TV was very small and not at all modern,",0
and all of it felt very outdated.,0
The worst part though was the temperature.,0
The room was VERY warm all night long (and this was in a cold night in November).,0
"We got up in the middle of the night to crank up the AC and open the window, but the temperature didn't change.",0
"Only when we called the front desk in the morning did they instruct us to remove the wood paneling below the sink in the bathroom (which revealed all of the pipes, etc.) and manually turn down the radiator (which was on 5 - the highest level!).",0
"I would not recommend staying here,",1
"it is not a good value at all,",0
not is it a good experience.,0
The room - on the executive floor - could have used a good dusting.,0
"The bathroom was only partly cleaned, especially the toilet wasn't. Even after telling housekeeping about the problems,",0
"one would figure, they would give the room a very good cleaning the next day - well, that didn't happen.",0
"Just the bath tub and the sinks got cleaned, the mirror, glass partition, tiles were very obviously not.",0
We had reserved a non-smoking room,0
and upon check-in the receptionist confirmed the room as non-smoking.,0
Entering the room we had to discover - it was a smoking room.,0
"People in our party asked for another room, because of the proximity to the elevator and twin beds (mentioned in the reservation) and were told very rudely that's the room we've given to you,",0
so you have to take itThis is no 5-star hotel.,0
"But with their location and being one of the hotels in Berlin offering a great number of rooms, they think they simply don't have to work that hard.",0
Very disappointing experience there!,0
"At $114 for each of three summer weeknights, I was really satisfied with the Intercontinental.",0
I booked about a month in advance on their website.,0
"As stated in other reviews, the location is on the (slightly tourist) bus line 200 and a 5 minute walk to Ku'damm, and 10 minutes to the Zoo Garten Train station.",0
"Note, it was a 15-20 minute walk to a cheap internet cafe (open till eleven-thirty) attached to a dunkin donuts on Ku'damm.",0
This was a decent vantage point and was obviously a safe and quiet neighborhood.,0
Fast food restaurants are opposite the Gedaechtnis Kirche if you are absolutely desperare for cheap fare late at night.,0
"The rooms themselves are very modern, but almost frustratingly so.",0
"The bathroom door has a hole for a handle,",0
and the toilet door is opaque.,0
"So, no real sense of firm privacy is established.",0
"The shower also had no curtain, but rather a limited glass door.",0
So it was kind of easy to accidentally spill some water on the floor (not to mention slip and break your neck).,0
Still the design was cool and memorable.,0
"The breakast buffet was too expensive for our liking,",0
"however, our guide book had a listing of six special places for breakfast in Berlin.",0
"What also bothered me was the fact there was a 3 euro surcharge for dialing a 800 number (so to use a phone card, you had to go to the Telefonzelle across the street.",0
The pool was mid-seized but adequate and clean.,0
The whirlpool was out of this world.,0
On weeknights we had the facilitiies practically all to ourselves.,0
"Plus they are open to 11, perfect after a long day and big dinner.",0
The staff was friendly and completely bilingual.,0
Be sure to pick up an umbrella (for free) at the concierge if you anticipate rain while sightseeing.,1
Alltogether I enjoyed my stay and would book again at anything below $120 a night.,0
I was quite pleased with this hotel.,0
"Like one of the other reviewers, I was also impressed that the room was ready when I arrived in the morning.",0
They even left some sugar energy tablet things on the pillow to help get over jet lag.,0
The price was very reasonable and included daily buffet breakfast and wireless internet access.,0
The breakfast had something for everybody (European and American breakfast foods).,0
The staff were very helpful;,0
"I needed to print something,",0
and they let me print it for free in their business center.,0
"There is a tiny elevator, which is nice if you have a heavy suitcase.",0
"They have a decent restaurant just off the lobby,",0
"and while they don't do room service (contrary to what the hotel information book in the room says),",0
you can order something and go down to pick it up and take back to your room.,0
"One thing I didn't realize until the end of my stay was that there is a grocery store just down the street,",0
"so if you don't want to pay minibar charges,",0
you can go buy your own water and snacks.,1
"As far as location, this was a nice neighborhood and convenient to the subway, restaurants, shopping, etc. I was a female traveling alone,",0
and I felt perfectly safe walking around there at night.,0
"The room was about the normal size for Europe (i.e. small),",0
but very clean and with a window that could open.,0
I didn't hear any noise from outside.,0
"The walls are a little thin, though, so if you're a light sleeper,",0
"you might want to bring ear plugs to protect you from your neighbor's late-night television, discussions, etc. I stayed there for business and then a few days being a tourist.",1
"The only warning I have to offer is if you want to sleep past 8 AM, make sure you hang the do not disturb sign on your door.",1
The uber-efficient cleaning staff will attempt multiple times to clean your room if you don't have the sign displayed.,0
"I may be too crititical,",0
but I found this hotel quite bad.,0
"The rooms are kept clean , but since the hotel is quite old,",0
it doesn't have a very clean look.,0
"Staff was not especially friendly,",0
I have seen better.,0
"They were not unfriendly either,",0
they just didn't seem to care much.,0
Breakfast was tasteless.,0
But the worst thing was the indoor noise.,0
I had asked for a quiet room.,0
From 8 o' clock on it was just a banging of doors and throwing things around in the hallway.,0
Roomcleaning takes place in as loud a fashion as possible.,0
"And since the hotel needs renovation,",0
it all seems to happen right next to you.,0
Another thing is that the cleaning lady just walked into my room on the morning of my last day.,0
She totally ignored the do-not-disturb sign,0
and just walked in immediately after knocking.,0
I was still in bed!,0
That just topped it off.,0
I was so relieved to leave this place.,0
"Beware that the so-called standard room is so tiny,",0
two people need to take turns walking around the room.,0
The hotel claim that this is a standard room for two is based upon the size of the bed which nearly fills the space of the room.,0
Berlin Plaza has no air conditioning,0
and windows open only part way.,0
"On the plus side, hotel does have a GREAT location and is clean.",0
Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in may 2008.,0
"I had booked a quiet singleroom with a bathtub, however, when I arrived they said I will receive the familyroom, for unknown reasons.",0
Sounded good in theory.,0
But then it turns out that there where 2 rooms in my room.,0
What do you do with two rooms when you're alone?,0
Nothing.,0
"There where a lot of closets, but I didn't need them as I was only there for a short stay.",0
"The rooms where spacious, everything was clean and the beds are really good.",0
"The bathroom was a let down,",0
it was really tiny and did not have a bathtub like I requested.,0
Also I wonder how a whole family would manage in this tiny bathroom.,0
"The room was on the corner, facing a really noisy street, which meant I had to keep the window shut at night.",0
"I am more of an open-window kinda person, that's why I requested a quiet room.",0
Even with the window shut you could hear trafficnoise all through the night.,0
"My room was on the 4th floor, that had dark and claustrophobic hallways.",0
"The elevators where really really slow, and looked a little shabby.",0
Then the breakfast.,0
Like someone has already pointed out; they seemed to struggle keeping up with things.,0
"Tables where not cleaned, and even the food was short in the last hour,",0
I had to do with the leftovers at 9 o clock.,0
The next day that problem already occured at 8!,0
"All in all, nothing to write home about.",0
It's clean and the beds are good.,0
"But the hotel did not fulfill my wishes, which where a quiet room and a bathtub in the bathroom.",0
Those are things that are important to me.,0
Instead I got a family room facing a noisy street and a tiny shower.,0
This makes me not want to recommend this hotel.,1
And one last thing; there are no tea/coffee facillities in the room.,0
"This was a big let dow for me,since I am used to having that,",0
"but I heard this is typical german,",0
so I can't blame the hotel for that.,0
"For 88 euros a night (double room), this hotel is an excellent value.",0
"The lobby isn't very impressive, and we were a bit worried as we headed up to our room,",0
"but it was fairly modern,",0
clean and had a nice view down to the road.,0
"I had read that the street was a bit noisy,",0
but we found it to be very quiet actually.,0
Slept VERY well.,0
"This hotel is also dog-friendly,",0
though there aren't any parks very close by.,0
Secure parking is available in the garage next door for 11 euros a day.,0
"Overall, we were very pleased with our pick and would definitely stay there again.",0
Fantastic Hotel.,0
Immacuately clean.,0
Staff extremely friendly and helpful.,0
The location was also very accessible both on foot and trains to many Berlin Attractions in the centre of Berlin.,0
I would strongly reccomend this hotel and would have no hesitation in staying there again.,1
"HI We have stayed in this hotel twice and are staying again later this year, for the value its great is this hotel,",0
"we had a 2 bedroom room for 125 euro a night including breakfast for 3 people, fab price, hotel in great location for ku dam and also for underground stations,",0
"hard rock cafe a few doors away and the breakfast is fab, busy but worth the wait,",0
"id defo say a good hotel for the money,",0
"only down side is no air conditioning, but open the windows its ok.",0
"This hotel is located just off the kurfurstendam str, which is the main shopping street in Berlin.",0
"The area is full of shops, restaurants, and bars.",0
The hotel is close to several subways on different routes.,0
You could basically walk to any major tourist attraction.,0
"The hotel is about a five minute walk to the Berlin Zoo, and maybe a fifteen minute walk to Postdamer Platz.",0
The hotel lobby has recently been renovated.,0
Very nice bar and restaurant/lounge area.,0
The rooms are spacious,0
but eventually need renovating.,0
The only complaint would be the night club down the street which played loud bass pounding music on the weekends.,0
We loved the location of the hotel and would stay there again!,0
Please read this before before booking your break away in this hotel.,1
All together we were a group of 8 on a 3 night stay in Berlin as part of a package starting from Thursday through to Sunday.,0
We decided to book an extra night online and arrive on a Wednesday.,0
"When we arrived at the hotel, the reception staff appeared to be very unhelpful, I would say to state they were not friendly would be an understatement.",0
"So we proceeded to check in,",0
or at least attempted to.,0
"The receptionist then informed us that dispite booking on Expedia with this hotel,",0
"they were not expecting us until the following day, where 3 nights were booked.",0
Instead they told us that we were in their sister hotel for 1 night.,0
"We were told to go,",0
the only instruction given was to turn right outside door and straight down.,0
After about ten minutes of lugging our luggage around we found an old building which later we found was the sister hotel.,0
Walking in the hotel was dirty and dated.,0
Our hotel room was really not an improvement.,0
Very basic facilities with dated furniture.,0
"We had a small fridge with a mini bar, which had a selection of 6 drinks.",0
The hotel was situated in a seedy part of town.,0
The bathroom was small.,0
"The shower sprayed more water over the curtian then into the bath itself,",0
each time after taking a shower the bathroom floor was soaked.,0
We decided to go back and urgue our case.,0
We booked the Berlin Mark Hotel and not the Appt Berlin Mark Hotel.,0
"When we went the back the unhelpful receptionist's told us that in fact we were expected there and not the sister hotel, we should never have been sent away.",0
"Although it was there error, they actually still refused to move us,",0
they told us it was too late to be moved as we had already checked in.,0
"We asked to speak to a Manager for help,",0
they told us to take a seat.,0
"After about 15 minutes we re-approached the receptionist as nobody came out to see us, and were told that there was nothing they could do, despite it being their error.",0
We gave up and returned the following day for the remainder of our stay.,0
The hotel was not much of an improvement.,0
Room was very basic with the same features of the old Appt Berlin Hotel.,0
Breakfast was always busy.,0
Tables were hardly ever cleared from the previous people,0
"and by the time a fresh pot of coffee arrived,",0
or your milk did - it was time to leave.,0
The service was dreadful.,0
"Throughout our stay we would often liase with recpeption staff, but again they were always unhelpful.",0
"They appeared not to want to help you, and was always a real effort engaging with them.",0
Not once did they smile.,0
A memeber of our group was sent to another hotel to iron her eveining clothes - when she returned stating that she could not find hotel they directed her the hotel opposite.,0
They could have done this at the begining instead of sending her on a hike of the backstreets of Berlin.,0
"So, if you are not looking for service, unfriendly staff, basic facilities then I recommend you book this place!",1
"Please do not be fooled by the pictures on the internet - If you book this hotel, please expect an 'Allocation on Arrival' service as you will have no idea where you will be placed.",1
"Nice hotel with good location near the shopping area, subway station, Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church etc. Rooms are quite small, but clean and modern.",0
Plenty of TV channels in many languages.,0
"Nice breakfast, although the breakfast room is quite crowded.",0
They had on some days another breakfast room opened on another floor.,0
They were kind enough to allow us an early check-in.,0
Polite staff.,0
Late review for Berlin Markt.,0
Stayed there for 2 nights at December 2004.,0
Hotel was standard 3 stars,0
and breakfast buffet was included on the price.,0
"Pleasant stay just before christmas, hotel was quite packed.",0
Reception wasn��_t the friendliest but did their jobs well.,0
There was a construction site next to hotel,0
"but there were no annoying noise, at least to our ears.",0
The Mark Hotel on Meineke Strasse is truly not a 3 star hotel.,0
The hotel is very tired and is in desperate need of a refurb.,0
The staff are surly,0
and not interested in any problems you may have.,0
"When we booked the room the description on the website said it came with a separate seating area, despite raising the issue with reception we were basically told this was not so , I guess someone needs to amend the website.",0
The room given to us was on the first floor.,0
Supposedly a non smoking room it came complete with ash tray and matches.,0
The room was not very big,0
and the bed took up the majority of the room.,0
The room was at the back of the hotel and overlooked an overgrown garden with a block of flats looking directly onto the rooms.,0
Although the bed linen was clean there wasn't much going for the room at all.,0
The furniture is dark brown and very old and battered,0
and the sliding wardrobe door seemed to be just about hanging on.,0
As for the bathroom well what can we say.,0
The shower sliding door is barely big enough for a normal sized person to get through.,0
The frame of the shower was also falling to pieces and came off in your hand when you closed the door.,0
The shower had no height adjustment bar,0
and so showering each morning was quite difficult.,0
Also it was difficult to regulate the water,0
and it was either boiling hot or freezing cold.,0
You either had to sit cross legged on the shower floor or stand up and use the shower by hand.,0
The hot tap became very hot,0
and a towel had to be used to turn it off.,0
We complained to management three times,0
but nothing was done.,0
One of the lamps over the sink had blown,0
and despite telling the cleaner it was still not changed.,0
The bathroom had had the tiles painted to give the appearance of a newly refurbished room.,0
Breakfast was hardly worth the effort.,0
There were not enough tables for everyone,0
and some people who couldn't get a table ended up going away.,0
If you came down late most of the food had gone and was not replenished.,0
Coffee was luke warm and not a teabag in sight only various types of Twinings darjeeling.,0
We did notice a room next to reception with more tables and a waitress walking in and out with coffee,0
but no one was told if this room was an extra room for breakfast.,0
In fact the room was used to store suitcases for people checking out of their rooms.,0
It was not locked so anyone could walk in.,0
The main reception area and corridors stink of cigarette smoke as there is a table and chairs positioned along the corridor for smokers.,0
The only good thing we can say it that the hotel is in a very good position just off ku'damm and great for exploring Berlin.,0
Stayed in this hotel over New Year for the past 2 years.,0
2004 2005.,0
Ideally located and a comfortable hotel.,0
"Yes, breakfast is a little busy, but come on folks, be patient!",0
What do some people want!,0
The food was great and always plentiful and was replenished regualrly.,0
The rooms had modern decor and were far more than adequate.,0
"We got great deals on both occasions, and could not complain for the price.",0
It is ideally placed to tour Berlin from.,0
The tour bus goes from the end of the street and is close to Zoo Station.,0
"The nearby restaurants were excellent,",0
"the one almost opposite -called the Meineke I believe, was good, but we also enjoyed the small restaurant, which you would probably mistake for a bar on the same side as the hotel at the top of the street as you head towards the Ku'Damn.",0
Berlin is a top city and highly recommended for New Year!,1
Try out a trabi safari - it is great fun - especially in 3ft of snow in a car with no heating......................,1
or brakes come to think of it!!,0
"I have just returned from a weekend in Berlin, where I stayed at the Berlin Mark Hotel.",0
"The best thing about this hotel is the location: around the corner from the Kurfurstendam, in central Berlin, and close to lots of public transport.",0
"Also, getting taxis from hotel never took more than 3 minutes when the hotel called, which was rather impressive.",0
The hotel is very basic,0
and the room I was given had a single bed (I haven't seen this in hotels for years!) and was smaller than most student accommodation I have seen!,0
The room was extremely basic and the bed,0
"and pillow were far too soft, which made me have a terrible time sleeping.",0
I was also given a smoking room.,0
"I don't recall Expedia (with whom I booked) asking if I wanted a smoking or non-smoking room, so I felt I didn't have arguments to change.",0
When I asked for a non-smoking room I was told they were fully booked and I couldn't change.,0
"Fair enough, but I think there is only one floor in the whole building (of 7 floors) that is non-smoking, so be aware of that when booking.",0
The staff are helpful and nice,0
but the whole place is in serious need of a refurbishment.,0
The decor is very early 80s with some nauseating bright green everywhere...,0
"It was also strange to be handed a key, rather than a card for the room,",0
but I suppose that is just me.,0
Brekfast is plentiful but very basic.,0
Beware of smoking areas for people having breakfast that are very close to non-smoking.,1
"In fact, the hotel reeked of cigarettes.",0
"In other words, if you don't mind the comfort of your bed and if you are a smoker, you will love it!",0
"If not, stay away.",0
There are plenty of hotels to choose from in the area.,0
Very upset with this hotel.,0
We had booked as part of a group for three nights from Thursday,0
and then booked an extra night for the Wednesday night via Expedia.,0
Although this was advertised,0
and showed photogaphs of the Berlin Mark on Meineke Strasse we found this not to be the case AFTER we had arrived at the hotel,0
"and the receptionist simply looked up the reservation in her system, pointed to the crossroads and informed us that the hotel we were staying in was around the corner and four minutes away.",0
"No map, no directions and no further offer of assistance.",0
We went to visit the hotel to find that it was a converted apartment block in a rather seedy part of a very busy road.,0
"No Bar, a makeshift breakfast room.",0
No restaurant and a basic bedroom which was large but a rather dirty and poorly decorated bathroom.,0
We retrurned to the Berlin Mark Hotel on Meineke Strasse to plead our case that we we were under the impression that we had booked that hotel and wanted to be there for the four nights,0
and not have to change the following day as our friends were due to arrive the next day.,0
"Suddenly, the receptionist found a reservation for us which means that they had expected us all along and was about to check us into that hotel when she realised that her colleague had sent us off to another property.",0
In fact BOTH receptionists on Thursday afternoon were very surly and discourteous,0
and even after me asking if I could speak with somebody else and being TOLD to take a seat in the bar as it would take a,0
"while before someone could see us,",0
we were left waiting until I had to go back to the empty desk to see if somebody could talk to us.,0
"All I could be told was that as I had booked through Expedia,",0
there was nothing they could do.,0
"I tried politely to explain that after 25 years int he hotel industry I knew that they could, in fact, transfer a booking within the hotel if they really wanted to - again, to no avail.",0
If you do not expect any kind of service whatsoever then go ahead and book these hotels but be sure what you are getting as they also have a third old building across the street which is a little more convenient than having to drag luggage three long blocks,1
but as it has lots of stairs,0
and no lift it is also below standard.,0
We finally accepted our fate and reconciled to spend the night in the cell block.,0
the only saviour was the ARTOTEL across the street which had a nice bar,0
and pleasant staff so they got our business.,0
"The shower in the bathroom simply sprayed water everywhere in the APART HOTEL (read falling APART Hotel) causing the bathroom floor to flood and cause a very dangerous health  safety hazardBreakfast in the Mark Hotel in Meineke Strasse was absolutely chaotic with surly, rude staff who snapped at you if you asked them to bring tea or coffee pots or more orange juice or bread fort oast.",0
A member of our group was sent by reception to two local dry cleaners shops to get an outfit for that evening ironed before sending her to their hotel accross the street where they had a laundry facility all the time thus wasting an hour and making her late for her evening function.,0
"So, some of the poorest service I have ever experienced, misleading advertising, surly/miserable/rude staff and awful public areas.",0
Thank goodness there are plenty of alternative hotels for future visits and for us to recommend to others.,0
"Hotel location was good,",0
rooms were clean  the housekeeping staff were lovely.,0
Room smelt of smoke when 'no smoking' requested.,0
Room was small - no bath  the shower room was very small with a tiny corner shower.,0
The Reception staff were aloof  sometimes quite rude.,0
Breakfast was very average  waiting staff very average - on the plus side Berlin was amazing the restaurant across the road from the Mark Hotel - The Meineke Restaurant was lovely both food wise  staff wise  there was a little bar on the same side of the road as the hotel but near to Kurfurstendamm str can't remember the name,0
but the late night atmosphere for couples was romantic and welcoming - see as much as you can Berlin it is a lovely city - we will return - different hotel though!,0
unfortunately this hotel is extremely disappointing.,0
"the hotel has had a facelift,",0
but the workings underneath are old.,0
"for instance, my door didn't even close properly - but after requesting to change rooms i found out none of them do!",0
all the doors are warped,0
but instead they spent their renovation money on new bedspreads.,0
it was a sign i should have checked out immediately - at one point there wasn't even hot water in the hotel for over an hour.,0
staff were less than helpful.,0
meanwhile the lovely modern shower fixtures fell off the wall every single morning,0
while i took my (occasionally cold) shower.,0
if you're looking for a high end hotel i suggest you go somewhere else.,1
This hotel is lovely.,0
"However, the maids burst into our room twice on the day we were checking out.",0
"The first time before 8:00 a.m., and the second around 9:00 a.m. Upon reporting this to the reception on checking out, the clerk looked at me and said what is your problem?",0
This is a five star property!,0
The maids shouldn't be anywhere near that room until we have cleared check-out.,0
"No manners, and I can't recommend this hotel as a great five-star.",0
Just returned from a fortnight in Berlin staying at the Steigenberger.,0
Lovely hotel.,0
"well appointed,wonderful breakfast buffet.",0
Staff marvelous and very patient with my bad German though reception staff and many others spoke good English.,0
Room very comfortable with climate control.,0
Well placed for getting around the city.,0
Especially good for shopping on the Kurfustendamm...bring an extra bag!!,1
loved it!,0
Had the pleasure of visiting Berlin for a city break in September.,0
"1st impression were great of the hotel,",0
we were really looking forward to staying in a 5 star hotel.,0
Immediately we were meet by the Hotels bell man at the taxi door,0
and he took our luggage.,0
"Swift check in, so far so good.",0
We had looked to pay for an upgraded to the executive floor,0
but they were fully booked.,0
"In the Bedroom this is were the hotel did not meet my expectations the bedroom we got was definitely not 5 stars, no tea or coffee making facilities in the room, no bath robes or slippers, and for the bathroom, well I've seen bigger bathrooms on airplanes I can stress this enough",0
and it was stiflingly hot all the time.,0
In there guest information stated that rooms had access to the internet,0
but seemly our room did not have.,0
"I had booked a double room but got two single beds, with a folded duvet resting at the bottom of the bed;",0
it had the look of a Young Hostel.,0
"I do have to mention the staffs were excellent in all departments of the hotel, Very helpful.",0
I would not recommend the restaurant either the food in not good quality,1
and service was very slow and offer priced.,0
I do usually stay in 4 star hotel and have stayed in better 4 stars than the  5 star Steigenberger Berlin.,0
I booked online and got a great rate.,0
"Upon check-in, I was shocked at the room we received -- very stripped-down.",0
It was like a 3-star hotel -- of the Quality Inn level.,0
No amenities at all...,0
there was one pump in the shower that was a body and/or shampoo.,0
The towels were so thin and coarse.,0
"I was really shocked,",0
and a bit disgusted.,0
I asked to see the manager,0
and she was polite was but did not acknowledge the problem until I became very specific about what I expect from a 5-star,0
and what I am receiving.,0
"With a bit of insistence, she moved us into a 4+-star room.",0
"Here there were individual amenities, albeit cheap ones -- not luxurious by any means, robes, and the room just seemed genenally cleaner and brighter.",0
"I agree with another reviewer, that they have rooms for those that book a cheap rate",0
and other rooms for those that pay the rack rate.,0
"At any rate, I have no idea how they can call themselves 5-star.",0
"Last two days in Germany so decided to push the boat out and book the *****, got a good price and most importantly the promise of a kingsize bed.",0
"Upon arrival, checked in went up to the room and was very dissappointed.",0
"The room was a bit shabby,",0
several cracked tiles in the bathroom and the bed was not kingsize.,0
"There was the space for a kingsize bed alright,",0
but two single mattresses had been pushed in,0
and there was a gap between the bedside table and the mattress!!,0
I went down to the reception,0
and gingerly approached the subject of the bed size.,0
"There was about 5 Gastapo power dressed receptionists manning the desk at the time,",0
most seemed a bit scary!.,0
"Was it because they thought I had got the room too cheap?,",0
it seemed a bit like that to me.,0
Anyway they sent me off to look at another room which was equally as poor.,0
Back down I went,0
"and when I produced my bit of paper that clearly said kingsize bed,",0
they gave me the keys of a decent room.,0
Their attitude was shockingly bad,0
"and I truly believe they were judging me on my appearance (regular - holiday mode, not powered up though!)",0
and also that I had booked a cheapie.,0
We booked a non-smoking room and found that we had been allocated a smoking room of very inferior quality but managed to change to a vastly superior room the next day by the skin of our teeth.,0
That evening we reserved a table for the Fish Buffet for 8pm.,0
Arrived at 8 promptly.,0
We eventually managed to be shown to our table and ordered wine,0
but only afterwards to discover all the food had gone - nothing left except the dregs!,0
The waiter seemed not too bothered.,0
I questioned him why he had taken our wine order surely knowing full well there was no food left.,0
He seemed less than apologetic and asked for payment for the wine!,0
I complained at reception,0
and we were offered free cocktails.,0
"On the day of our return, with time on our hands, we decided to take the train to the airport and were advised by the bell captain to go via Bundes Platz to Schoenefeld.",0
Taking his advice was a big mistake - there are no trains to Schoenefeld via Bundes Platz on a Sunday.,0
This hotel is badly in need of a manager who knows what is going on in the place.,0
We arrived at the hotel at 7pm,0
and strangely enough there was no porter available to help us with the luggage.,0
Check in was quick and effortless,0
and we were assigned room 553.,0
The room was small,0
and not what we had booked.,0
"The requested room was ""garden view"" away from the heavy traffic outside the hotel.",0
This room was facing the street,0
"and it was HOT, not just warm but VERY HOT.",0
The air-conditioning is not that,0
"but rather a ventilation system which did not cool the room down, opening the windows meant that the system switched off",0
and of course the street noise became unbearable.,0
As a Sofitel Privilege customer (their loyalty card scheme) the room did feature a welcome platter of fruit and some mineral water.,0
What it did not have was the requested double bed; instead it had two single beds pushed together with uncomfortable mattresses and tiny duvets.,0
"Not all the Sofitel international standard, where was the MyBed (Sofitel's incredibly comfortable bed)?",0
Not willing to accept this for __�_145/night I changed room to across the hall but was reminded by the staff that the room standard for the category booked.,0
Well I don't agree with that,0
and I found this an inherent problem with German Sofitels.,0
They are not up to the international standards.,0
The new room (554) at least had a double bed (but alas still two tiny duvets),0
and of course the bed was incredibly uncomfortable (same old mattress).,0
But at least it was quiet.,0
"Positives about the hotel are: the staff (very courteous at all levels), the food (breakfast was excellent and so was dinner in the restaurant) and location.",0
"Negatives: Bed (if you are used to Sofitel beds from around there world don't stay here), bedding (old polyester), house keeping (on both morning the room was not properly cleaned and coffee and toiletry supplies were not replenished; the room was also not very clean with huge stains on the curtains), in room equipment (if you love 70s retro you will love the TV in the room).",1
"This hotel should not be allowed to call itself a Sofitel as the rooms are well below standard, the staff however are right up there.",0
We stayed at the sofitel for two days on a jolly to Berlin.,0
"One thing we discovered very quickly that in Berlin the hotel you choose is all about location,",0
there are some places which may have great reviews for the hotel,0
"but the location could be right oppposite a building site or miles from the nearest bars and restaurants, or just in the wrong part of town.",0
Berlin has an awful lot of construction going on so choose carefully.,0
"This place is in a pretty excellent location really, right opposite the Zoo, specify a courtyard facing room if you want quiet,",0
"there is quite a busy road going past the front of the hotel, Across the busy road is the Zoo,",0
you really want a room at the back of the hotel rather than at the front.,1
"The hotel is about 5 minutes walk from the famous bombed out church and the start of the K'dam,",0
also 5 minutes walk is Ka De We which is the 2nd the biggest department store in Europe after Harrods.,0
"East Berlin centre is about 15 mins by taxi (there is a rank at the front of the hotel)The hotel itself is comfortable and well equipped with a very good range of spa treatments,",0
the room we had was quite large,0
"and the only complaint we have is that the bath towels are very small,",0
The goodies in the bathroom are very high quaility.,0
The bar is quite small but serves everything you need at usual hotel prices.,0
We didnt try the restaurant as we prefer to eat out,0
but it seemed quite nice and very popular.,0
The staff are efficient and very polite and helpful.,0
All in all a perfectly good nice hotel in a very good location which as I said before is everything in Berlin.,0
Top tip: if you fly in,0
and out of Tegel airport dont go through the security,0
"and departures gates until you are ready to fly as there is Nothing on the other side of security, just gates and seats.",0
"small duty free in a cabin, I would definately stay at the sofitel again rather than risk a hotel in the wrong place which would seriously dent your enjoyment of a short stay",0
We booked our stay for the Easter weekend in a standard room.,0
The hotel is very centrally situated and has a wow factor in the reception atrium with its awe-inspiring aquadrome.,0
"This is normally a pay-to-see commercial attraction separate from the hotel,",0
and it has the unfortunate disadvantage of constantly crowding the lobby with passing pedestrians having a free look from the hotel side.,0
Our room was adequate if a little small but was clean and well presented.,0
"Our stay entitled us to a bottle of champagne on arrival in the room,",0
but this turned out to be a bottle of German sekt when it arrived.,0
It took a telephone call from us to the manager before room service would replace it with the genuine article.,0
Dinner on the first night in the restaurant H-eat was less than expected.,0
The food was disappointing in presentation and flavour,0
and our main dishes achieved an unusual condition in that they were both over-cooked and cold.,0
Our disapointment was compounded with the arrival of the bill __�_146 for just 2 courses and wine.,0
"Indeed one of the most consistent things with this hotel is its high prices for less than perfect drinks, food and service.",0
Drink prices in the reception bar were high by comparrison with other 5 star Berlin hotels with which we are familiar.,0
Breakfast had to be queued for,0
and it is not ideal to be given the option of breakfast in the reception atrium while being gawped at by tourists along with the fish!,0
One very unpleasant experience in both the restaurant and the lobby bar area was the mass of fruit flies that became a constant and annoying nuisance.,0
Perhaps the hotel will try to remove the nuisance at some stage - certainly staff seemed not to care.,0
The main issue with the hotel is it's 5 star status.,0
I would question any establishment who uses this label while not providing basic 5 star amenities in rooms.,0
"No bathrobes or slippers, no mineral water, no CD player, one towel per guest per day, no turn-down service, and poor quality toiletries and absence of simple items such as cotton buds, nail files and hair conditioner.",0
"Needless to say, all higher-price rooms offer these",0
but as the place isn't cheap to begin with and it claims to be 5 star why the difference between this and other 5 star operations in Berlin?,0
I do not find a large fish tank sufficient reason to go back,0
and if I ever see another fruit fly it'll be too soon!,0
The location of this hotel is wonderful.,0
"Easy walking distance to shops, restaurants and historic sights.",0
My room was well appointed.,0
I do wish that the staff were more accomodating.,0
I didn't have any bottled water left in the fridge in my room,0
and so I went down to the bar that is just off the main lobby and asked for a glass of water.,0
I was told to Sit down,0
and we will bring it to you.,0
"I did just that,",0
but no one ever came to bring me the glass of water.,0
"I then walked over to the front desk, and requested that some bottled water be brought up to my room from room service.",0
"It didn't come, so I then had to leave the hotel, walk to a restaurant up the street, where they sold me some bottled water, that I brought back to my room.",0
My room was not cleaned until very late in the day even,0
though I had the Please clean my room sign hung on my door since early morning.,0
"In short, if the service at this hotel were up to par, it would be a good choice.",0
"Because I couldn't even get a glass of water or a bottle of water at this hotel, I will look elsewhere for my next stay.",0
"Oh, and on check out, they had charged me for the bottled water that they did not bring me, so of course, I protested , and they reluctantly took it off of my bill.",0
I use TripAdvisor.com regularly so when I saw that the Radisson SAS Berlin had been rated the number one hotel in the city I was confident I would be in for something special.,0
Instead I was in for 8 international calls to the hotel,0
and the central reservations number because the people I dealt with firstly reserved me rooms on incorrect dates,0
and secondly failed to send me any kind of confirmation.,0
I've now resolved the issue and am just hoping that my actual stay will prove less stressful than the reservations process.,0
"Based on the evidence so far, this will be a triumph of hope over experience.",0
Stayed in this hotel 4 nights over Easter 2008.,0
Fabulous location - really couldn't get any better.,0
Only a 10-15 minute stroll to Brandenburg gate  Reichstag down the beautiful Unter Den Linden.,0
20-25 minutes to Potsdamer Platz.,0
Alternatively it's around __�_8 in a taxi.,0
Metro and Tram services are excellent and close by.,0
Hotel is right adjacent to Berliner Dom (Berlin Cathedral) and the Museum Island with a huge choice of museums.,0
Hackescher Market with it's bars and restaurants is only an 5 minute walk away.,0
Hotel itself is very impressive.,0
Rooms very large with big bathrooms and a walk-in shower (unusual in European Hotels).,0
We had a room facing out towards the aquarium - it's beautiful to look at the fish from your balcony at night.,0
"Although the reception and bar area is below your window you cannot hear a single sound as the very thick,",0
floor to ceiling glass balcony doors are soundproofed.,0
As too are the room doors so you cannot hear any other guests or morning maid service in the hallways.,0
The only downfall of an inner room is that you cannot get fresh air through an open window.,0
If you prefer an outside room ask for one on an upper floor facing towards Berlin Catherdral only some 100 yards away.,1
Staff are exceptionally helpful and courteous.,0
Breakfast buffet is superb.,0
"There is a very nice Spa in the basement with small pool, sauna, steamroom and other therapy spa options.",0
Be warned - the sauna and steam room does not permit swim wear i.e. it's nude (and mixed) with a towel for modesty if you prefer.,0
My only 2 complaints are:-1. Whilst the aquarium is positioned in the hotel lobby/bar area it is not actually part of the hotel but belongs to the Aqua Dom next door.,0
Thus in order to take a ride in the elevator up through the middle of the huge cylindrical aquarium you must pay an entrance fee to the Aqua Dom which is expensive.,0
"Sadly the hotel advertisements give the impression the aquarium is part of the hotel,",0
however you can still enjoy stunning views of the aquarium.,0
"2. The pillows are awful, too soft.",0
Unfortunately the hotel does not offer a pillow service and has no alternative to the ones in the room (I asked and failed).,0
The lack of a pillow service is remarkable for a 5 star hotel.,0
The hotel staff was generally unhelpful.,0
Rooms look worn and bed linens are not changed on a daily basis.,0
Soap was never replaced during my 5 day stay (they were too small to begin with and I only received one small one for bath and sink).,0
"It was a huge struggle to get a nice room,",0
rooms were in need of repair.,0
Not a 5 star hotel in any way.,0
Would not stay again.,0
I was stayed here from the 27th -the 31st of May.,0
There are many positive things about the hotel.,0
The location is wonderful.,0
"You are next to the Berlin Dom, the sea life center and the spree river.",0
All other major attraction is about 15mins away.,0
You can take the 100  200 buses which stop a block away from the hotel or just walk.,0
The S-ban  The U-ban are also very close.,0
This is a great starting point to explore the both east  West Berlin.,0
The hotel staff is very fluent in English and very knowledgeable about the city and what's going on.,0
The rooms are very clean and up to date with there fixtures.,0
I stayed in a business class room on the sixth floor.,0
"You have a bed, 2 night tables, a TV (flat screen), well stocked mini bar and a safe.",0
"The hot has two restaurants, a bar, and a gym.",0
Breakfast is served till 11 in the heat restaurant.,0
The have a large variety of food which was great,0
but if this is not included in your hotel package stay away.,0
Its 25Euros per person other wise.,0
A few things made my experience here good but not great.,0
The lobby smelled.,0
I think this was because of the spree river,0
but there is a rotten egg smell that takes over at times.,0
The smell never made it pass the lobby,0
though so the room smelled fine.,0
"Though clean the rooms are a bit bare,",0
they were a bit cold to me (some may like this).,0
My bed was supposed to be a king,0
but it was two twins put together.,0
If you rolled you would fall through the cracks.,0
There was no universal adapter in the room.,0
They did provide me with one when I ask,0
but in a 5* hotel I expected one to be there.,0
Lastly housekeeping came to the rooms as early as 7:30. To solve this problem I put the Do Not Disturb sign up till I left the room in the mornings.,0
I had expected more from this hotel.,0
"It is well situated and has an impressive lobby,",0
but the room was a little small with a tiny bathroom.,0
"When I returned my main course in the restaurant because it was unacceptable (lobster the size of a prawn), they still expected me to pay for it.",0
Had to talk to the manager to sort that out.,0
"Also upon check-out, they got the costs of my stay wrong, trying to charge me __�_200 more then Radisson reservations had booked the room at.",0
Luckily I had a printout of my confirmation.,0
"The lobby staff where not all that helpful, they couldn't tell me how to turn out an annoying light in my room, or the cost of the movie service.",0
All in all not the usual Radisson service.,0
Have to note though that the doorman was VERY HELPFUL.,0
"After a very promising reception, our room was disappointingly small for a hotel of this rating without any views.",0
"Not did it have any of the normal four-star features like tea-bags, biscuits, pillow chocolate etc. We had to ask for a bath robe.",0
There was no bidet in the bathroom which had an awkward toilet cut-off door arrangement,0
and they seemed to be on a cost-cutting spree here too as they did not replace all the shampoos and soaps daily.,0
On the third day our key would not work,0
and we had to traipse all the way back to reception to be told that our three day booking had mistakenly been entered as two days - for this they did not apologise -,0
and we then were locked out of our room for a further forty minutes,0
while they cleaned the room which they had not bothered to do earlier bacause of the check-in mix-up.,0
The spectalular fish tank in the foyer cannot be entered via the hotel- you have to go around several streets to enter it - at a fee.,0
All in all this hotel should be classified three star,0
and they should send the staff on a training course in customer relations.,0
Never again!,0
This hotel was picked by a friend for location and comfort.,0
It was everything a 5 star hotel should be and more!,0
We stayed in a Business Suite.,0
Huge bathroom and bed plus work desk and internet connection.,0
Great view of the river.,0
"When we presented our pre-paid reservation through Expedia at the check-in desk, we were told that it wasn't registered.",0
"We had to make an expensive call on our cellphone to the booking agency in Norway to get a confirmation that everything should be ok,",0
and that we should point out the booking code on our print-out.,0
The check-in man then rang the hotel's reservation office,0
and it turned out they had apparently forgot to forward our reservation internally.,0
"When we pointed out in so many words that this was something he ought to have checked out before turning us away and forcing us to make a 15euro call back home, he gave us free tickets to the Aqua land as a compensation.",0
"Never got the chance to use them though, preferring to spend our limited time on Berlin's many fascinating museums.",0
"Our room was a standard size business room, with a nice view towards a park and the Nikolaikirche.",0
It was extremely well insulated against noise;,0
a very important point since the street in front of the hotel is heavily trafficked at most times.,0
"In addition, just a stonethrow away, The Palast der Republik was in the process of being torn down.",0
"This was very noisy indeed, but with the window closed we heard practically nothing.",0
"On the other hand, there was a very tiresome muzac constantly being piped in the corridors.",0
Made you practically run to and from the elevator to get away from it as fast as possible.,0
"Breakfast was not included in our Expedia booking,",0
and we thought it was inordinately expensive.,0
But no problem; there were plenty of opportunities for a very good and inexpensive breakfast within a couple of minutes on foot from the hotel entrance.,0
"The bathroom was very stylish in appereance, but at closer look,",0
several design solutions were just very awkward.,0
"For one thing, the wash basin was a porcellain bowl placed on a wooden top.",0
Absolutely a feast for the eye when new.,0
"But because of the constant spilling of water from handwashing etc, the wood was now cracking up and appearing very worn.",0
"Furthermore, the glass half-wall glued to the bathtub was inadequate when showering, with lots of water on the floor as a result.",0
"On the other hand, this inflexible halfwall must be a major obstacle for the room ladies when they're cleaning the upper part of the tub.",0
A full-length shower curtain would've been a much better option.,0
And then there was the awkward design of a single swingdoor functioning alternatively for the separate toilet cubicle and the rest of the bathroom.,0
"This door wasn't even full-length, so it must be a real problem for American couples with their hang-ups about bodily sounds when on the toilet.",0
"But to end on a more positive note: A plus for the flatscreen TV with many international channels, for the in-room coffee- and teamaking equipment, and, last but certainly not least, for very good beds.",0
"good hotel located at alexander platz like 15 minutes by taxi to shopping areasclean midsize room ,mine was a single with little strange configuration in the hotel corner everything correct hotel with modern decorgood breakfast buffet included in rateperfect for business with a lot of restaurants around go for the italian left hand size of square coming from the hotel",0
Booked at this hotle over a month in advance.,0
Upon arrival was informed that our room was unavailable - 'there was a problem'.,0
We were transferred to another hotel having been told that there has been an issue with their computer (and that 25 other people were also affected).,0
"Substitute hotel was poorly located for us and, as a consequence, our first break to Berlin was ruined.",0
Staff at the Alex Plaza were unhelpful and had a 'couldn't care less' attitude.,0
We got the strong impression that 'tourists' were very much secondary to 'business' guests.,0
Very disappointed.,0
"Spent five nights and enjoyed the spacious and spotless very bright rooms, modern steam and sauna area with cold plunge, and complete breakfast buffet.",0
The staff was helpful,0
and their food recommendations in the immediate vicinity were right on the mark.,0
Active bar in the evening.,0
Excellent location.,0
Would not hesitate to return.,0
The service at the Alexandra Hotel was rude and slow especially on reception.,0
"When I sat in the cocktail lounge for a drink, I had to wait for ages to be served (along with several other tables).",0
The staff tend to be young and inexperienced.,0
"The single room I had was very small with a sloping roof and despite only having a small single bed, there wasn't even room for for a desk.",0
None of the special touches I am used to a hotel of this rating (I had to ask for toiletries because I had forgotton my shampoo but this is something I normally don't need to concern myself with in a 4 star hotel).,0
No clock radio was provided which meant you had to rely on the facilities provided with the TV,0
but all the instructions for the audio/video equipment are in German,0
and no-one gave me the wakeup call I asked for.,0
The hotel is understaffed and staff's knowledge of English isn't good.,0
All in all a very big disappointment!,0
Well located and nice rooms but too noisy!!!,0
"they organise private parties on the seventh floor of the hotel,",0
so it is impossible to sleep on the fith,0
and sixth floor unitl 3 am in the morning!!,0
be careful with this fact!!,0
it ruined our holiday in Berlin!!,0
Checked into Alexander Plaza on a Friday afternoon for two nights.,0
"Was told that my prepaid room was on the 6th floor and, due to construction, the elevator only went to 5th floor.",0
I'd have to schlep my bags (and myself) up,0
and down the stairs everytime I wanted to go in or out.,0
What an unpleasant surprise!,0
They didn't even offer to have someone carry my suitcases up the stairs.,0
"When I mentioned my knee surgery (cane was the tip-off), they made a big show of reluctantly upgarding me to a double on another floor.",0
Tiny room (upgraded!) that looked out on a small interior space--had to keep curtains drawn at all times to prevent office workers across the airspace from looking in.,0
Recently renovated hotel is in a great location for walking to museums and shopping in an interesting gentrifying section of East Berlin.,0
Wait staff at the bar was very pleasant.,0
"With all lights on, the room was dark; poor lighting except next to the bed; tiny bath with 30x30-inch shower; only one towel until I asked for another; 17 Euro breakfast that was just okay in content; Business Center that was closed of the weekend at 4p on Friday.",0
"My second stay at the Grosser Kurf��__rst was as enjoyable as the first, a year ago.",0
"Excellent location - calm yet only a 10 minute walk from the Museeninsel, with the U-Bahn in front of the hotel.",0
"Friendly staff at reception, bar and breakfast.",0
Nice lobby with bar.,0
"Clean, quiet and comfortable rooms.",0
The building is clear and bright.,0
I will most definitely return here.,0
Try and find a web deal (I booked via Hotel[-]): during Summer rooms can be booked for as low as 59 euro (and that includes breakfast).,1
"Location is fine, place is clean, and no problems with the bathroom, but oh that postage-stamp bed for two ...",0
"and when we asked the next day to be moved to a room with either twins or a decent-sized bed,",0
we were told that the hotel was full up.,0
I'm ambivalent about staying here again.,0
I got a much better deal at the Marriott Potsdamer Platz on a previous trip.,0
"Sure, the Alsterhof is in a great location,",0
"but I liked the nice big king-sized bed at the Marriott,",0
and both are convenient to Berlin's extensive public transport.,0
"If I ever book the Alsterhof again, I'll be sure to ask for a decent bed!",0
Really good location.,0
Great room with big bathroom.,0
Very nice breakfast.,0
"The only bad thing was the missing aircondition,",0
although this would only be a problem in the summer.,0
I had to attend Berlin at rather short notice to attend a large conferenece of lawyers: INTA.,0
All the good hotels in town were completely booked out which left me the Alsterhof as my only option.,0
I arrived about 10 am and was told my room wasn't ready.,0
No apology from the staff just a statement that it would be ready at 1 maybe 2. Surly staff behind front desk,0
but very nice fellow who acted as doorman during the day.,0
"No air-conditioning, characterless rooms althought they were clean.",0
My mini bar was locked,0
and it took 12 hours to get a key to it.,0
Depressing and not to be recommended.,0
I have just returned from a five night stay in the hotel.,0
Arrived early and left my luggage at reception.,0
They do have a room for storing luggage,0
and this is where my case was kept.,0
The room itself was ok,0
but the area around the bath had mold growing on it.,0
I pointed this out to both the reception and the cleaning staff.,0
Nothing happened.,0
On the third day I tackled them again about the problem .,0
Explanation given was the cleaning staff are Chinese and do not speak either English or German so they could not guarantee the problem could be resolved.,0
I insisted on changing rooms and was eventually given a room on the executive floor.,0
That room was much larger but with worn and dirty carpet.,0
The breakfast buffet is adequate .,0
The internet access is like a small telephone box with no seat.,0
Location is quiet but the U bahn station is not on a main line,0
and you have to change trains twice to get to Zoo Station which has connections to most places,0
and the 100  200 buses stop there.,0
It is 20 minutes walk to the hotel from there or 5 minutes by cab.,0
Cost 5euro.,0
Hasir restaurant on the corner of the street is very good.,0
Stayed for 3 nights and have mixed feelings about this hotel.,0
I booked a single room - big mistake.,0
It was no bigger than a matchbox,0
"and didn't even have a wardrobe,",0
"just a small rail that pulled out from the end of the bed, which was set against a wall.",0
The bed was quite high,0
and the draws for clothes were below the mattress.,0
"So no closet, no chest of draws and a room the size of a phonebox.",0
"I complained but was told nothing doing,",0
"hotel was full and I got what I'd paid for, a single room.",0
"Breakfast was adequate, but the worst I've had in all my trips to Berlin.",0
"It had all the usual, egg, bacon, cheeses etc but no smoked salmon and was not great for a 4 star hotel.",0
It done its job but didn't make you want to refill your plate a second time.,0
It wasn't all bad though.,0
The actual hotel is very nice and has a quite expensive feel about it,0
and as mentioned by others the location is superb.,0
"I always try to stay near the Kudamm,",0
and this is on a quite street just behind the KaDeWe.,0
I couldn't have wished for a better spot.,0
A supermarket and some very nice restaurants a 2 min walk away with Zoo station a 10 min stroll.,0
The staff were very friendly and helpful apart form one (there's always one!),0
but this was the guy I complained to so we probably got off on the wrong footing.,0
The rest were fine and pleasant.,0
Would I stay again?,0
If the price was right and only in a double room.,0
I would trade the breakfast off for the location which again is excellent.,0
"This is a basic, modern, no frills hotel.",0
I just got back from a week stay there.,0
The rooms are very clean and functional,0
and the staff were pleasant and helpful.,0
I have no real complaints except that the inroom safe had to be paid for on a daily basis which was a little odd (maybe its a German hotel thing)I got a great winter deal on the room but be aware the buffet breakfast (which is very good) is not included in the price and is Very expensive (16 Euros p/p).,0
I would advise getting an inclusive deal or eating at one of the many local cafes which offered breakfast for a third of the price.,1
Getting around Berlin is easy with public transportation very close by,0
and the hotel is close to the more interesting neighborhoods of Schoneberg and Kreuzberg (maps are deceptive these areas are easily in safe walking distance of the hotel even though they appeared to be further away)Overall this hotel is fine for a basic safe modern hotel,0
but don't expect much in the way of character.,0
"First, the location.",0
It's not that good for the center attractions and not well connected to public transports.,0
"Second, the staff.",0
"Very arrogant, not helpful at all.",0
Finally the room.,0
"Kind of small, bad furnished and without any air-conditioning.",0
I have stayed 7 nights,0
and they just changed the sheets once,0
and I think they never changed the towels.,0
I have to refer to the most disgusting thing in this hotel.,0
"The bathroom have a open sewer of a kind, next to the bathtub that exhales the most noxious odor.",0
And this was true in my bedroom,0
and also in the other bedrooms of the hotel where fellow Portuguese travelers stayed.,0
I most warn everybody to avoid this hotel.,1
"They haven't no English instructions for the phone, they don't have a proper luggage deposit,",0
our luggage just stayed in the lobby,0
and anyone can open it or take it.,0
(We tried the last part and they didn't care),0
"I have written a previous review on the Alsterhof and having stayed there again,",0
I thought I should share my experiences with readers on this site.,0
The mark of a good hotel is its ability to deal with the unexpected and its ability to make guests feel at home.,0
On both counts the Alsterhof let me down.,0
When I arrived there was no water for a few hours due to construction work.,0
I was told nothing about this at check-in,0
and only discovered that this was the case when I tried to take a shower.,0
On calling the reception desk there was no apology or alternative offer given.,0
"Indeed, what irked the most was that the room was full of overpriced bottles of mineral water that they could have offered to guests during this time to use.",0
"Fortunately, I didn't have to wait long.",0
The other thing is that the inroom wifi is outrageously priced at EUR9 for 2 hours.,0
The receptionist told me that I could use the PCs in reception for free.,0
The main difficulty with that is that all the files that I have on my laptop that I need to be able to send to my office can't be transferred to the PCs in Reception.,0
The hotel is OK for leisure travellers but not particularly useful for business travellers.,0
"Finally, on my last day when I took breakfast I was treated to a very loud conversation about me by the waiters in the restaurant",0
and the fact that I had checked-out,0
and hadn't paid for breakfast.,0
It wasn't true but it was quite embarrassing,0
and really did not inspire confidence.,0
There was no apology from them for the mistake or the inconvenience.,0
"In fact, given that and the fact that you basically have to pay for everything in the hotel, including essentials like shampoo, gives the impression that every penny counts and making the guest feel at home comes last.",0
"the hotel is near Alexander Platz,",0
there is a bus stop just in front of the hotel which allows you to easily reach Alxender Platz if you r not in the mood to walk 5 minutes... from Alexander Platz u can take all kind of public transports that will allow u to reach all the parts of the city.,0
"The rooms were big enough, clean and very confortable,",0
the people who work there are friendly.,0
breakfast was very good.,0
I really advice the hotel,1
My wife and I stayed in the Agon Alexanderplatz for 3 nights for a long weekend break,0
and the decision was primarily based on cost and the reviews listed here.,0
"Although some parts of the hotel are OK,",0
there is too much against it to say this is a good hotel.,0
"We arrived in Berlin from Tegel airport which does not have its own train station,",0
you have to get on a bus which will take you to a station on the U-Bahn so we ended up catching a taxi to the hotel instead which came to about 25 Euro's which is cheaper than most taxi's to other European cities we have been to.,0
Initial impressions of the place are understandibly quite bad.,0
"Its right in the heart of the old East Berlin so every building in the area is communist in design, rectangular and not pretty and surrounded by busy main roads.",0
"Inside though is a bit better, checking in was quick",0
but some of the staff behind reception need a few lessons in customer service (ie.,0
a smile or even some acknowledgment when handing in keys wouldn't go amiss).,0
"We got a room on the first floor, used the 2 lifts initially which look more like detention cells, walked through the dark and very green hallway to our room.",0
We had a south facing room which meant we were away from the main noise from the traffic and could see the main highrises around Alexanderplatz but did overlook some other grotty buildings.,0
From then on we used the stairs coming to and from the room,0
but in the evenings these are pitch black.,0
"The room in fairness was very spacious and included its own area for the wardrobe, a free to use safe, small table and chair in the middle of the floor (and a pretty stained floor at that) and a small kitchenette in the corner (although nothing is included to use with it so unless you bring your own pots, pans and cutlery I see little point in this being here).",0
Bathroom is basic including a shower cubicle (complete with a large damp patch in the corner).,0
The double room was in fact 2 twin beds so you will have to move them together,0
but the covers only just fit the width of the single beds,0
and the pillow is virtually non existent,0
and even doubling up is not enough so sleeping for us was hard to achieve.,0
There is also no air conditioning either,0
and so the room can get quite warm especially in the evening.,0
The room also has its own balcony which has not been cleaned for ages,0
and still had traces of what used to shield the balcony along the side so could be quite dangerous as these are very sharp.,0
Being on the first floor we could not leave the balcony door or window open as anyone could potentially climb in if they wanted to make an effort.,0
"Breakfast was included in the price although nothing to shout home about,",0
"there were no hot breakfast options available, only a few cold meats, plenty of cereal and bread rolls and a handful of cake slices.",0
My wife thought the breakfast was excellent,0
though but hot breakfasts are more to my liking.,0
"The location I would say is well within walking distance to the majority of sites up to the Brandenburg Gate and Reichstag, beyond that you may want to choose the U-Bahn or S-Bahn instead, the nearest one being in Alexanderplatz some 5 minutes away.",0
"I would say one thing though, coming home when its dark to the hotel is quite off putting as its not very busy at all and very dark in places",0
but there is a tram station round the corner.,0
The trams though only serve the old East side.,0
We paid just ���149.,0
75 for the 3 nights which is exceptionally cheap,0
and therefore the review has to be put into that kind of perspective.,0
"If I were coming to Berlin again, I would probably find a hotel nearer the Brandenburg Gate so its more central to all sites and would be happy to pay a bit more",0
but for those on a budget and do not mind relinquishing some comforts then this hotel is fine.,1
Personally the fact that I had major trouble sleeping in the room is the largest factor to decide if a hotel is good or bad,0
and in this case I would stay here again.,0
"Saved up all year for my 14 yr old son and myself to have a relaxing, enjoyable break in Berlin, found this hotel on web but due to technical probs, ended up booking via travel agent.",0
"Arrived pretty late for our 4 night stay, because of flight delay.",0
"Noticed straight away that we were not made to feel welcome,",0
just told where our room was,0
"and that breakfast was between 7-10,I put this down to me being tired",0
and perhaps a little more 'sensitive' than I should be.,0
It took us 5 mins to actually get into the room via key card as had no idea how to use it (No instructions given at desk!!) First impression of room...,0
"not to bad, quite spacious and looked clean.",0
"Opened bathroom door and stepped back from 'strange' smell,",0
toilet had been used but not flushed...,0
oversight by cleaners perhaps??,0
Room stuffy so opened window and was literally BLASTED by the noise from the extremely busy cross-roads right outside our window...,0
'thank goodness I remembered my ear-plugs' I thought.,0
Both fell into bed exhausted and tried to sleep...,0
"no chance for me I'm afraid, the traffic noise was just to great, even with plugs!!",0
"In the morning, breakfast turned out to be chaos with other guests stood with plates of food but nowhere to sit as not enough room.",0
We stood and waited (being British we queued of course!!!),0
and eventually got a table.,0
You are NOT allowed to help yourself to the cutlery so we had to wait for that.,0
Food was adequate and you are able to eat as much of it as you like.,0
"I asked at the reception if a fan was available so that I could shut the window but this request met with a very hostile ""NO,",0
"YOU ARE NOT TO HAVE ONE!!!!""",0
"So we returned to our stuffy, airless OR very noisy room.",0
Other problems that cropped up was that we bought some cakes,0
"but they needed a fork ,",0
"my son asked very politely at the reception to borrow 2 forks, guess what...we weren't allowed!!",0
"(Eating cakes using a plastic credit card is quite ingenious I think!!) I was plagued by mosquitoes and have ended up with 6 nasty,",0
"very inflamed bites which resulted me seeking medical advice about ( not from anyone at the hotel though, I hasten to add!!) Because of the mozzie problem, we ended up having to go through the night with the window shut in a room where the temp was 75 degrees(thermometer in room) so woke up with headaches, sweaty and feeling generally yuk!!",0
I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone I liked.,1
We both loved Berlin,0
but our trip was definitely marred by the accommodation.,0
I would have found somewhere else to stay if I had the funds,0
but we had to put up with where we were...,0
worst luck!!,0
In short....,0
If you are STILL temped to stay at this place: TAKE VERY GOOD EAR PLUGS.,1
TAKE A PORTABLE FAN.,0
ADEQUATE MOSQUITO REPELLANT.,0
ANTI-HISTAMINE MEDICATION / CREAM.,0
DON'T EXPECT ANYTHING AND YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!!,1
We joined a tour group out of Singapore to Eastern Europe,0
and our last stop was Berlin.,0
Very very unfortunate for us that Park Inn was fully booked,0
and the tour agent booked this hotel.,0
and in my oppinion a hostel would be better than wasting your money on a somewhat dodgy three stars.,1
No cafes or shops within safe walking distance.,0
Save yourselves!!!!!,0
"The hotel is in a very good location, close to the train station and other city attractions.",0
The rooms were great,0
"If you are a espresso lover, well this is for you.",1
but I would have spent a lot of time in it to make up for the deficiencies of this place.,0
But given the price I would recommend this one unreservedly.,1
"The swimming pool is rather small, just enough to refresh yourself.",0
Tips for Berlin: Public transport is brilliant.,0
The hotel should give a password out to guests that check-in or at least program a time-out to avoid this frustrating situation.,0
"for the standard they boast, you are better off staying in a lesser star establishment where you will get better service.",1
Concierge is not available 24 hours.,0
"at bar called vang gogh the owner play piano.....try the dada falafel at oranien str, and cafe einstein.",1
We did not have breakfast at the hotel but opted to grab breads/pastries/coffee from the many food-outlets in the main stations.,0
"All in all a OK hotel, but not nice and cosy.",0
"after booking thru expedia, i read some reviews and was concerned about the Warwick.",0
I was wondering what i was getting myself into.,0
"The hotel is older,",0
but i found it clean.,0
Front staff are really trying to improve their customer service.,0
Errors upon checkin.,0
They gave me a single bed when i asked for seperate queen beds.,0
They told me no rooms available.,0
They offered to bring an extra cot.,0
"When i was settling into room, front staff said they located a two queen room",0
and so i was moved.,0
Package was to include free parking,0
but i was charged for valet parking which i'm in dispute with the Warwick about.,0
I'lll see what they do about it.,0
Would i stay again?,0
Hard to say.,0
Room was quiet and clean.,0
Nothing spectacular.,0
"I'd give it a better rating if there wasn't so many errors with the bill and checkin, but they seem to be trying",0
and sometimes that's all you can ask for.,0
The previous positive reviews must have been from those who were given OUR room.,0
Just hope that you get there to get a room ahead of someone else!,1
"We booked this hotel through Hotwire, which was misleading, as it listed this hotel as a Pike Street Market hotel.",0
Not so: it is 5 long city blocks away.,0
"It also lists as a boutique hotel which is to make it sound quaint, I guess.",0
Translate it: Old and unrelenting.,0
We called ahead because we specifically needed two beds for medical reasons.,0
I even checked in early to secure a room.,0
I was told by a counter help that your room is locked in for the 14th floor and two beds.,0
"We returned at 6 p.m. to be told that because of increased business,",0
"our room had been changed to a room with one king bed (very, very small) and a lower floor.",0
Now: I had been told to check in early,0
and that I would get a higher floor room with two beds.,0
Not so.,0
"To say that I have a room locked in and then to DOWN GRADE me, is inexcusable.",0
I only regret that I didn't wear my new Trip adviser bill hat!,0
"The front desk was very, very rude; cutting my sentences off midway to tell me that it didn't matter what I was told,",0
a crowd had come in,0
and they sold my room.,0
I spent a SLEEPLESS night on a lower floor next to my husband who needed his own bed.,0
How rude.,0
They weren't even apologetic.,0
It was ridiculous.,0
I will never stay here again.,0
Beware: some rooms are very small and outdated,1
and the pool smells like mildew.,0
Seriously.,0
"I was basically told because I booked through Hotwire, I wasn't a preferred customer!",0
They don't realize the power of Trip adviser!,0
My recommendation: Save your money!,1
There are several better hotels nearby who appreciate your business and will work with you.,1
"It isn't that great of a location, and certainly not worth being treated as if I were pond scum because of using Hotwire (as if people who saved money were stupid).",0
Take my advise: spend your well earned money at King's Motel (1/2 block away) or at the Sheraton or Weston.,1
It was a real bummer staying here!,0
We were here for the Easter long weekend and loved it.,0
We received a very fair rate,0
and the staff at the front desk were very helpful,0
and they even had a free shuttle to downtown which we only used on our first night becuase we soon realised just how close we really were to everything.,0
we were about a 25 minutte walk to Pioneer Square about 15 minute walk to Pike Place Mareket and a 20 minute walk to Space Needle / EMP.,0
The rooms are clean,0
"and well kept with a mini fridge in the room that I really like, but sadly no coffee maker.",0
My only major beef was the $21 for nightly parking which was a blatant rip-off considering they only charge $8 to park all-day.,0
"Having never been to Seattle, I am pleased with the Warwick and my stay there.",0
The staff was amicable,0
and fast--there were always at least 3 people at the front desk.,0
The lobby also has a nice lounge area with a fireplace.,0
They also have a business center with 2 computers with internet access and a printer (free use of all when I was there).,0
"My only complaint is the jaccuzi was out of service and being worked on in the pool area (which is in the basement),",0
and the construction zone atmosphere down there was unpleasant.,0
Room service and the food was excellent and fast.,0
"If you book a room, ask for a space needle view--I stayed on the 6th floor in a corner room and had a nice view.",1
"Plus, it was fairly quiet",0
and I never heard noise (i.e. someone else's loud TV) except for the occasional bus route on the street below.,0
"If you don't mind walking, you are only a couple blocks from Westlake shopping center and a few blocks from Pike's Marketplace.",1
"Across the street is a gourmet market--Ralph's--that stays open 'till midnight, and a bakery called Dahlia's--known for their coconut cream pie.",0
"And best of all, I booked this room on Expedia for a mere $105/night.",0
"You won't be smack in the center of everything,",0
but a little walking will get you to the main tourist spots.,0
I felt relaxed and comfortable there--I recommend it.,1
The location of the hotel is good - fairly close to everything.,0
The rooms were clean,0
"and we had a balcony and a great view of the Space Needle (I'd recommend asking for a space needle view, if you book).",1
"The price was alright as well, at least in comparison to other hotels in Seattle....",0
"Problems: There isn't a moderate / good for family restaurant in the hotel and it is hard to find these in the hotel neighborhood as well, unless you just want fast food.",0
"(There is a small grocery/wine store across the street that is open until late, which was really nice!) The staff was not friendly, nor helpful.",0
The front desk was unable to give us walking directions to the wharf (I would have thought a lot of people would have asked for that...).,0
"There was also problems with getting a late checkout - because our flight out was at 6pm,",0
I had emailed the hotel before we left for Seattle to get a late check-out.,0
"The hotel had responded that, that wouldn't be a problem.",0
"When we checked in, the front desk clerk said we had to ask the night before we check out.",0
"When I asked that night, he said we had to call down in the morning....",0
just extra unneccessary hassle.,0
"Overall, I'd stay somewhere else on my next trip.",0
"I'm not a terribly critical person, but I really hated this hotel.",0
"It has some good points - for example, it's cheaper than other options in downtown Seattle and it's in a decent location.",0
"(It's not in the center of downtown like the other hotels, but it's only a 5 or 6 block walk).",0
"However, those are the only positives.",0
The rooms are very dark,0
and the furniture is really old and mismatched.,0
This gives the impression of it being dirty as soon a you walk in.,0
"As far as cleanliness, it was just okay - it's the kind of place that makes you feel as",0
though you need to check the sheets before crawling into bed.,1
"The blankets were really, really worn, but the sheets seemed clean.",0
Everything else was a crap shoot.,0
My biggest problem with the room was that it was freezing.,0
"They have these balconies, which are not meant for actually standing on, which were very drafty and made the room unbearably cold.",0
"I turned up the thermostat, but it didn't help.",0
"And when it actually kicked on ,",0
the smell that came out of the vent was disgusting.,0
It smelled like mold and mildew.,0
We actually turned off the heat and froze just so we wouldn't be subjected to the smell.,0
Anyway...,0
I thought this hotel would be okay since I was not planning on being in it very often and I really just needed a convenient location to sleep.,0
Now that I've stayed there I realize it would have been just as cost effective to spend a little more and stay somewhere that provided some comfort.,0
"The Warwick charges $23,",0
"(I think), for parking and $12 for internet /per day.",0
"By the time you add all the extras, I could've stayed at the Red Lion or Hotel Monaco for only slightly more.",0
"If you're going to Seattle, look hard at spending a little extra for another hotel - and you'll probably even end up right in the center of downtown.",1
"The Warwick is located in Belltown, an interesting neighborhood with some fabulous restaurants.",0
It has a nice lobby,0
and the rooms were pretty clean.,0
"The front desk, however, was a horror show.",0
"We had asked for a pot of coffee to be delivered at 6am every morning, as we needed to be up and out by 7. On the third morning,",0
"we did not get our coffee,",0
and consequently arose an hour late.,0
And in Seattle of all places!,0
On two separate occasions we asked for the so-called complimentary transportation.,0
"Upon the first request, we were told we would have to wait at least a half hour",0
and that we should take a taxi.,0
The second time we asked for transportation we were told our destination was too far away.,0
The point is - don't advertise the service if there are caveats that go with it.,0
"The front desk staff was aloof and not interested in reparing the harm, and for that reason alone I would not stay there again.",0
But I do intend to return to Seattle - great town!,0
"There is nothing really seriously wrong with the hotel,",0
but it just doesn't have any wow factor.,0
"Positives: Location is great for exploring the city (sight seeing, shopping, restaurants/clubs/bars),",0
concierge was helpful.,0
Deluxe room was big with a good view (18th floor).,0
"Negatives: Decor is very plain, nothing special, worn out.",0
"Instead of duvet there a blanket placed between two sheets, swimming pool is very very small but also very very dirty,",0
stuff at reception desk doesn't seem to be happy to work there so you also don't get any feeling you came to a good place Regarding the price we were paying (from 200 to 260USD per night) we expected a bit more.,0
Didn't get it...,0
We recently had a wonderful overnight at the Warwick.,0
It was an easy walk to Seattle Art Museum and even closer to downtown shopping.,0
"The front desk was extremely gracious at check in, offering shopping discount coupons and restaurant reservations.",0
We enjoyed breakfast at the hotel and the morning free coffee in the lobby.,0
The waitstaff in both the bar and hotel were attentive.,0
Our room on the 15th floor had a city/water view.,0
"While there are hotels closer in downtown,",0
we would have no problem choosing the Warwick again.,0
Centrally located hotel is a few blocks from the water and from popular nightlife and shopping options in Belltown and downtown.,0
I would classify this property as a three star location.,0
We paid a wedding rate so I am not sure how it fares from a value proposition.,0
The room was spacious although a little outdated.,0
Perhaps some rooms have decent views,0
but we were on a lower floor with a drab panaroma of the parking lot and some other buildings.,0
"There is an adequate fitness center, sauna and pool in the basement and a quaint bar/restaurant attached to the hotel.",0
Parking at $30 per day is an outrage but possibly standard for downtown (you can find street parking on the weekend to save a few dollars).,1
I would be willing to stay here again the future if the price was significantly lower than the nearby four-star competition.,0
Stayed here for 2 nights last week.,0
"Had a confirmed reservation via hotel website (with a printout in my hand),",0
but the front desk says the room is not available.,0
"Waited for about 20 minutes and a room became available,",0
although not the type I reserved.,0
"My rate included continental breakfast, but had to tell the front desk again who finally gave me the vouchers.",0
My room was on the 16th floor facing the Space Needle.,0
You can hear a lot of noise from the street until late night.,0
"Overall, I would not recommend this hotel.",1
Amenities Part of the reason we selected the hotel was because it advertised having a pool and hot-tub.,0
"The Pool ended up being so dirty that the sides, above the water were black with grime",0
and people had taken to scratching profanities into it.,0
Otherwise the rest of the pool had dark dirt stains covering the bottom and sides.,0
The hot-tub was luke warm at best,0
and just like the pool it was filthy.,0
We informed the desk about both the pool,0
and the hot-tub and they stated they were cleaned regularly and were operating as they should.,0
These statements indicated to us they did not care about what we thought once they had our money.,0
A further complaint was the difficulty in finding information related to their parking accommodations which turned out to cost an additional $27/day.,0
The rooms themselves were adequate,0
although the marble in the bathrooms could have used a thorough cleaning as they had dirt and rust stains.,0
"The best part about the hotel was the location as it was in walking distance of the Space Needle, The Public Market and for us Qwest Field.",0
This hotel is good if you are just looking to catch some sleep,1
but you do not worry too much about quality.,0
If you want to soak in the hot-tub or swim in the pool at the end of a long day look for other accommodations.,1
We booked this 4* hotel on the strength of the recommendations on trip advisor,0
and boy were we disappointed!,0
"All our previous selections had been a great sucess,",0
so we thought we'd increase our budget slightly and stay here for 2 nights on our way home.,0
We were travelling with 2 small children (57) so booked one room for us all.,0
The lobby of the hotel is small,0
and gloomy with 2 inconvenient steps down and this just about sums up the hotel.,0
We received a lukewarm welcome at check in (early evening) and a very weak offer of help with parking and our luggage.,0
"The room itself was dark with 2 very small double beds, but a view of the spaceneedle.",0
"The bathroom was dated (compared to other hotels we had just visited), a pretty pathetic shower and a hole in the ceiling.",0
We asked at guest services for recomendations for children friendly restaurants,0
and the staff shrugged their shoulders until a member of staff called Dave came to help us.,0
He was the most helpful member of staff we came across our entire stay!,0
He gave us directions  even advised us on portion sizes.,0
The other times that we contacted front desk/guest services (very difficult to tell them apart) we were met by unhelpful  unknowledgable staff for very straightforward requests verging on the sarcastic and rude.,0
"We enquired about other breakfast restaurants,",0
whale watching tours and pottery barn locations) and we ended up doing our own research and bookings.,0
The standard of housekeeping was not as good as it should have been - the maid didn't remove or replace dirty cups  glasses and wanted to get in our room at 8am on the day we were checking out.,0
"We only ate breakfast only once in the hotel, and the waitress (a mature lady) started off by giving our children (who were sitting quitely) a lecture about behaving and being good for their parents.",0
Slow service given a nearly empty restaurant.,0
The hotel is located centrally,0
"and we were able to walk to places,",0
but the parking is $27 a day for guests which we thought pricey.,0
"We were also told by the front desk that internet access on our laptop was free, but at checkout $11 per day had been added to our bill.",0
"When I questioned this, I was told that as I had been 'miss told' they would remove it, but I was made to feel pretty bad about it.",0
"Overall, its a dark, dated hotel let down badly by the unhelpful and rude staff.",0
We couldn't believe all the previous excellent tripadvisor reports!,0
This hotel completed extensive renovations in 2006,0
and the rooms are lovely.,0
"Although the rooms are modern,",0
the hotel has the feel of a traditional hotel.,0
The staff are all well dressed and well mannered and very professional.,0
The location is convenient,0
and there is a small gourmet supermarket across the street open until 1AM.,0
"As other reviewers have mentioned, however, street noise is a factor to be considered.",1
"The hotel has floor-to-ceiling single glazed windows and even on the 8th floor,",0
trucks and buses could be heard at all hours of the day.,0
Seattle is a very hilly city which adds to the vehicular noise.,0
"Most importantly, if you are planning to use the wi-fi internet access, BEWARE.",1
It's about $10 per day but the signal strength is super weak and inconsistent.,0
I had to stand next to my room door to get a halfway decent signal - at the desk there was almost no signal.,0
Hotel staff acknowledge this and have a LAN conversion kit which didn't work either.,0
"Bottom line, if internet access is a factor, stay elsewhere.",1
I just booked our room on hotwire and was disappointed as soon as I saw the hotel.,0
It looks old and not well kept.,0
I called to see what type of room we would be receiving,0
and the operator treated me like I was a homeless person begging for a room instead of a paying guest.,0
I am absolutely sick that we are now stuck at this hotel.,0
We arranged our stay through a travel agency,0
and unfortunately Warwick Seattle Hotel was the only dissapointment through our trip.,0
"During our 3 night stay in Warwick, we changed 3 rooms.",0
"Starting from the first minute of our stay, hotel personnel didn`t make us feel like a guest but more like an intruder.",0
They were very reluctant to help and solve complaints.,0
The hotel is right at downtown and 5 minutes to really good restaurants,0
but this seems like the only good thing about it.,0
"Although there was availability,",0
the first room they offered was at 2nd floor,0
and our window was directly opening to the car parking at the same level.,0
So we changed the room.,0
"In all 3 rooms, there was a loud sound coming from the air conditioner/ heating system which we found unbelievable for an hotel.",0
The hotel personnel told that it is a standard noise for all rooms.,0
"So, we tried to avoid using it during the night in order to sleep and if possible only",0
while we were watching TV loudly.,0
I attended a conference and stayed at this hotel for three miserable nights.,0
The lobby and dining areas are fine.,0
The rest of the hotel needs a lot of work.,0
I had a room on the quiet side of the 12th floor.,0
"Unfortunately, I don't think there is a quiet side of the hotel.",0
"As previous posts mentioned, there was a continuous draft through the sliding glass door since it wouldn't close all the way.",0
I asked to move to another room and was told that all the nonsmoking rooms were booked.,0
The room was so loud from buses,0
and other traffic noise that it sounded like a freight train was going to come through the wall at any time.,0
I've stayed at a lot of hotels on business trips,0
and this was by far the noisiest.,0
The towels and sheets were threadbare.,0
"The heater roared loudly,",0
and the room was either hot from the heater or cold from the draft.,0
The conference facilities were drafty,0
and the food was average.,0
"The front desk staff had a pleasant appearance but did not seem interested in providing any assistance with dining recommendations, transportation, directions, etc. I asked the bellman for directions to a restaurant",0
and he sent me down the wrong street.,0
This is not a hotel I can recommend for any type of group.,1
"Made a reservation using the 50% Entertainment book discount (mentioned at time of reservation) and when we went to check in,",0
they said they haven't honored that for weeks.,0
"So we cancelled the room before we found out that there was a huge convention in town that took over all the hotels in the area,",0
and we had to cut our vacation short.,0
The Warwick apparently thinks a few bucks (from milking conventioneers) is worth ticking off a few Entertainment book users.,0
Definitely not 3 star material to me...,0
pretty sleazy IMHO.,0
We just returned from a 3-night stay at the Hotel Warwick.,0
I agree with previous posters that the staff is nice and the location very convenient.,0
The hotel is an easy walk to downtown shopping areas and Seattle Center attractions.,0
"Overall, we enjoyed our stay,",0
but there were a few problems worth mentioning.,0
We chose this hotel in part because the rooms feature an outside balcony.,0
"My husband smokes, but I do not,",0
and we prefer to get a smoking room with windows or an outside balcony to minimize smoke inside the room.,0
"If this is your preference, be advised that the balconies are barely wide enough to fit a human.",1
"We did not feel safe actually standing on the balcony,",0
especially with the balcony door closed.,0
"Smokers beware: the hotel only has a few smoking rooms, all located on the second floor.",1
This floor is where the public meeting rooms,0
and restrooms for the restaurant and bar are located.,0
We requested a smoking room on an upper floor with a Space Needle view.,0
We were given a smoking room on the 2nd floor.,0
"No Space Needle, no view.",0
This was obviously not one of the renovated rooms.,0
"The ceiling light fixtures were about a dozen 1970s-era cans (track lighting) set in rows in the ceiling, directed at the bed.",0
It felt like starring in your very own intimate film.,0
"The bathroom also had a paper towel dispenser like in a public restroom and strange pink goo in the soap dispenser, which looked like it hadn't been changed since the track lighting was installed.",0
"The traffic noise was incredibly loud,",0
and hotel construction noise started very early.,0
"Due to a very late flight, the desk was unable to change our room on check-in, but told us to come back the next day.",0
"We changed to a nonsmoking 7th floor room the next day, which thankfully was more updated.",0
"The traffic noise was a little better a few floors up,",0
and we had a nice Space Needle view.,0
"The bed was comfortable, the amenities average.",0
We liked the in-room refrigerator.,0
There was intermittent construction noise throughout the hotel.,0
"Hotel renovations are ongoing; the noise wasn't too bad on the weekend,",0
but I would take care if staying during the week.,0
"Also, the smoke detector in our room was not operational (the device was unhooked and sitting on top of the closet).",0
"I called maintenance to have it hooked up, but it didn't get done during our stay.",0
We did not use the pool or jacuzzi.,0
"As a previous poster noted, the spa facilities are in the basement, and it felt too isolated for my comfort.",0
"However, we liked the bar quite a bit.",0
"Friendly staff, good drinks and draft beer selection and a nice atmosphere.",0
"We ate at the bar one night, primarily for convenience.",0
"There are certainly better places to eat in Seattle,",0
but the food was OK,0
and we had a nice time.,0
The concierge was very helpful in helping us select a restaurant that was perfect for our tastes and making dinner reservations.,0
"The lobby fireplace added a cheerful,",0
cozy ambience and we enjoyed warming up there after our sightseeing.,0
I will probably want to check out a different hotel the next time I am in Seattle.,0
"However, if you avoid the second floor rooms and don't mind a little construction noise,",1
"the Hotel Warwick is a convenient, friendly and generally comfortable place to stay.",0
We stayed at the Warwick for a night in October.,0
Our original room reeked of smoke and so we were downgraded (they said that at the front desk) to the 6th floor.,0
"Our room was small and poorly furnished and stocked (no microwave, fridge etc.).",0
"They charged us more than the quoted price,",0
"but the confirmation email I received only contained the confirmation #, not the price, so we have been fighting this for 7 days now.",0
"To top it all off, we were charged for 2 nights!",0
$487.,0
51 total--it is not worth the money at ALL.,0
We've been calling the hotel nightly and every employee we speak to is unable to fix the problem;,0
"we've been getting passed from manager to manager and department to department and we have to repeat our story and prove ourselves over and over again, despite being promised that it will be fixed immediately--I promise.",0
"This is, by far, the worst customer service experiences we've EVER had.",0
"the food was fantastic,the staff very helpful only complaint I asqued for two beds and got one",0
and my view was the wall to the parking lot.,0
"p.s. this complaint has nothing to do with the hotel only the neighborhood,",0
I'm from new york,0
and I'm used to deal with every nationality,0
but I had the desplausure of meating(not all)but the most recist people in my life,0
I see good reviews of the Warwick,0
and it shocks me...,0
"The staff was quite rude,",0
the rooms were fairly dirty.,0
I cut myself and asked for a bandaid,0
and they did not have any?!?!,0
I requested a bottle opener,0
and they also did not have that...,0
Go somewhere with better service.,1
My husband and I stayed at the Warwick for 2 nights this summer.,0
"When I made the reservations, I told the hotel that we would have a late arrival but please save a room on the higher floors with a view for us, as we would be there 2 nights.",0
"We ended up arriving at the Warwick at 10pm,",0
we checked into our 4th floor room and were very surprised when we opened the patio curtains only to find that we were looking directly at a cement wall about 2 feet away from the porch.,0
No view at all.,0
"We called the front desk,",0
"and they said sorry, but since we arrived late they were unable to accommodate us",0
but maybe the next night they would be able to move us to a higher room with a view.,0
"Sure enough, they did move us the next day into a beautiful room with a gorgeous view of the Space Needle.",0
"Both of the rooms we were in were lavishly decorated, sparkling clean, with comfortable beds.",0
Can't complain about the rooms.,0
"The Warwick is within walking distance of most, if not all, of the tourist attractions Seattle has to offer.",0
"The staff, however, left more to be desired.",0
"We do not have kids of our own,",0
but I noticed how rude the staff was to some small children that were in the lobby our second day there.,0
"It wasn't just one person, it was 2 staff members.",0
"One bellhop guy almost ran over some kids who were standing with their parents in the lobby waiting to check in,",0
then looked at the parents as if it was their fault.,0
"Then, another bellhop was passing by others with children in the lobby and scowled at them for no reason at all.",0
"It made me feel uncomfortable both times that I had to witness such rude behavior from the staff, and that would just lead me to believe that this hotel, quite frankly, does not like kids or value them as guests.",0
"Our second night there, my husband and I were standing in the lobby, waiting for some friends,",0
and there seemed to be a lot of unhappy hotel guests around us and at the check-in counter.,0
"Some were complaining about not getting the room they were promised, along with others.",0
"It wasn't just us, so beware, if you book at the Warwick, you will eventually get a beautiful room hopefully, but may need to deal with some not-so-nice staff to get it.",1
Myself and spouse stayed at the Warwick Seattle for four days in September.,0
This hotel does not disappoint as a reasonably priced stay in the downtown area.,0
It's an easy walk to all sightseeing attractions (five blocks from the waterfront) and there is a free bus in Seattle,0
but we could never figure out how that worked (do some research before you go!!).,1
"Our room (king bed) was spacious and nicely appointed, very comfortable and with plenty of pillows.",0
The coffee in the room of course was great (this being Seattle).,0
The bath is finished in marble with a deep tub,0
and hand-held shower which was a nice touch.,0
Toiletries were below average but that's not a huge consideration for us.,0
Our only complaints concerned the front desk.,0
I had made two reservations: one for the first part of our trip and one for the third leg (after Olympic Penninsula) but decided to cancel the second reservation.,0
When we arrived at the hotel after a full day of travel the desk clerk kept us waiting for several minutes without so much as a hello.,0
We moved to the second desk clerk when she was free and were told that our reservation could not be found.,0
No attempt was made to look for it.,0
We had to walk up the stairs to the parking garage and get our confirmation from our luggage,0
and only then did they find the reservation.,0
The following day my office tried to call and was told that we weren't staying there.,0
Parking is $21/day which is pretty steep,0
but the only option because parking in Seattle is scarce.,0
The hotel doesn't have a shuttle so the only other option was a cab which is about $30.The hotel restaurant is adequate,0
but for a really great breakfast walk a block to the Mayflower Park Hotel (pricey but fabulous).,1
The rooms at the Warwick were nice.,0
"They were clean, comfortable and quiet.",0
"However, there was nothing exceptional about them.",0
The restaurant was also nice,0
and the food was good.,0
"The staff, on the other hand, was not pleasant or helpful.",0
In fact there was one member of the staff who was outright rude.,0
I felt like I was in their way when checking in and asking questions.,0
"I would recommend the Warwick to someone looking for a reasonable priced hotel,",1
but don't expect too much.,1
"I was pleasantly surprised that I was given a room with a king-size bed,",0
"so I was off to a good start, but that soon ended.",0
The bed sheets were old,0
and felt like they were poorly washed.,0
The room had a very poor shower that trickled out water.,0
Plus they had rigged some type of showerhead using a bath faucet.,0
The drain was slow,0
and you waded around in the shower water even with the poor water flow from the shower.,0
One side of the room is all window with a patio window...,0
not much of a view.,0
So with the window also came all the city noise.,0
"Unfortunately, the fan settings for the room were either Off or Automatic so it did not help to drown out the city and hotel noise.",0
It was slightly cool outside,0
and the cold air just poured in from the bottom seal of the patio window.,0
The hotel does have a good selection of local beers and wines.,0
"The food was okay but very over priced, as you will find throughout the downtown area.",0
The best meal I had was at the Seattle Tap Room in the airport.,0
"Beware, if you use the Grayline for transportation, allow plenty of time, as they ran up to an hour late.",1
My mother and I stayed at the Warwick for 2 nights in November.,0
"The hotel itself was ok, fairly clean and decent location.",0
"The front desk staff, however are not helpful and pass the buck so as not to have to deal with a problem.",0
"If they are working on improving customer service , as previous reviews have stated, they have a ways to go.",0
I am glad I got a discount.,0
"The room was clean, but nothing special.",0
In fact the bathroom showed a bit of wear.,0
The size and amenities were no different from a good Best Western.,0
Just as noisy too.,0
Maybe that is why there is a discount.,0
The service was average.,0
"However, there is a good advantage to this hotel if you have a car.",1
You can park your car yourself and save money doing without valet service.,1
"If you approach from Lenora St, however, you have to make two lefts to get to the garage which is to the left of the lobby.",0
"The location is great for Belltown, the Federal Courthouse and the town's retail core.",0
The hotel is well located within the downtown core,0
but the traffic and street noise is very loud.,0
We were on the 7th floor and could hear people talking on the street across from the hotel.,0
City buses just waiting at the bus stop could be heard running in the room all night long.,0
Parking was expensive and there was no elevator in the parkade so if you have any mobility problems you need to use the valet parking.,1
"I booked this hotel through Hot Wire and called immediately requesting a nonsmoking room, a king bed and a room away from the elevator/ice.",0
The person I spoke to was pleasant and stated they could not guarantee these requests would be honored but would make a note on the reservation.,0
"At check-in, the person at the desk was very rude, said there were no special request noted on our reservation card andstated there were no king beds",0
and because of the way the reservation was made we were stuck with 2 double beds.,0
We were located directly accross from the elevator and ice!,0
It was nonsmoking.,0
There is no elevator from the parking garage to the hotel.,0
The Warwick mats in the garage are filthy as are the stairwells.,0
The part of the hotel that faces 4th smells of urine.,0
The carpets in the registration and elevator area need cleaning.,0
The upholstery and curtains in our room needed cleaning andpressing There was a sign in the bathroom about water conservation;,0
"however, the tub facet dripped continuously.",0
"The tub drain needsattention, the shower curtain has holes in it.",0
There was no coffee maker in the room.,0
The bedding did not fit the bed,0
and we found ourselves sleeping directly on the mattress with bedding askew.,0
Other staff were also unfriendly and short.,0
The housekeeping staff was quite pleasant.,0
I will NEVER stay at this hotel!,0
My husband and I stayed at The Moore for 3 nights/4 days beginning on September 15th.,0
The main purpose of our visit was to see a concert at the Paramount Theatre,0
but we decided to add a couple of extra days to see Seattle.,0
We found the hotel to be a great location to everything that downtown Seattle has to offer.,0
"Our room was a good size, clean and comfortable.",0
"Pike's Market, shopping and restaurants are all close by.",0
It's true that the hotel does not have the frills of other downtown hotels,0
"but, as far as I'm concerned, getting some fluffier towels",0
and free shampoo/conditioner is not worth an additional $150+ USD/night.,0
Suggestions: Woodland Park Zoo (fantastic and worth the 10 minute bus drive out of downtown); Anthony's Pier 66 (excellent seafood restaurant on the waterfront) Enjoy your stay at the Moore!,1
The Moore Hotel is touted as a once grand hotel,0
and serious emphasis must be placed on the 'once'.,0
"Although the lobby appears relatively modern,",0
the internal decor/style of the rooms are reminiscent of the 1940s.,0
"Rooms are very basic to say the least,",0
but you only get what you pay for,0
and the Moore represents fair value.,0
The TV in our room was damaged with poor sound quality and the bed slightly uncomfortable.,0
Rooms do not appear to have any functioning heating or built in fan/cooler/heaters which is a bit of a drawback depending on when you visit.,1
However the rooms were clean and the front desk staff incredibly helpful and welcoming.,0
We even got a free upgrade to a room with a ensuite.,0
Internet access is free in the lobby,0
and the Moore's downtown location is good.,0
Travellers considering staying at the mediocre Hostelling International Seattle should seriously consider staying at the Moore instead.,1
"The location is better,safer,cleaner",0
and the price virtually the same if you were considering a private room at HI.,1
"I usually stay at the Moore a couple times a year, without any problems.",0
I always book in advance and pay with my credit card.,0
Last time they asked for my drivers license.,0
With Identity theft on the rise - I told them I didn't have a problem showing ID - but I wasn't going to let them write my Drivers License down.,0
The Moore Hotel said that unless they wrote my drivers license down - I wouldn't be allowed to rent a room.,0
I told them that the Hilton didn't require extra ID,0
and My group went there instead.,0
I reported them to Visa.,0
"Despite the fact that this could be a very cool hotel, the place sucks.",0
"The front desk, one of the nights we were there, was run by one of the rudest people I have ever met.",0
"I will not name him, but when we had a problem with our room,",0
he was extremely rude and would not hear our issue.,0
"Very, very dissapointed.",0
"Okay, this is NOT a glam hotel,",0
but you can't beat the location!,0
There is no bellhop;,0
"the front desk service can be loveable, rude or hard to understand; and the water pressure isn't the greatest.",0
That's the worst of it.,0
What's so great about the Moore that I've visited and revisited and been a fan for nearly a decade now...,0
the price and the location.,0
"I don't go to Seattle to sit in my hotel room,",0
"I visit to walk around, to shop, to drink coffee and to see the water.",0
"At the Moore, you have it all at your doorstep.",0
"When I first started visiting, the neighborhood was in desperate need of police surveillance at night.",0
"As a single female traveler, I could walk around and feel relatively safe",0
and the front desk kept a good eye on their lobby and the comings and goings of their patrons.,0
"Now, the neighborhood immediately outside the door looks even safer",0
"and more options are available for shoppers, diners, beer and cocktail seekers than ever before.",0
Best part - YOU ARE ONLY TWO BLOCKS FROM THE WATERFRONT.,0
Request a 6th or 7th floor room facing the water and you'll enjoy a view that most visitors pay through the nose for.,1
"Walk to Pike Place in the morning, shopping at Pioneer Square in the afternoon, visit nearby Belltown at night.",1
Walk everywhere.,1
They'll hold your luggage for you either before your check-in time or after you've checked out but have a few hours to kill before catching your flight.,1
"Visiting the convention center - it's less than 10 minutes walk, grab coffee at the French Bakery at Pike's Place before you head into convention hell.",1
"Worst part - Parking - you have to pay,",0
there are two lots on either side of the hotel or try the Bon/Macy's parking lot for something a bit cheaper.,1
"Oh, and they like to keep your key at the front desk - there is only ONE KEY available per room, so if you're sharing with someone but have different itineraries, make a habit of dropping the key off at the front desk.",1
"I would trust these people,",0
I once left a drawerfull of clothes behind,0
"and they were kind enough to take care of them until I returned the next day, ashamed but extremely grateful.",0
"And if you've always wanted to be a bellboy,",0
there are a couple of luggage carts that you can wheel your stuff about.,0
"Felt like a weekend away from the wife and kids (more wife than kids to be honest- I know she wont read this !!) Chose Seattle to do this, as its within easy reach of my hometown Vancouver.",0
"Decided on the Moore Hotel,downtown as I'm both thrifty and poor and on reading previous reviews, seemed to suit my budget.",0
Also as I was staying only one night-how bad could it be.,0
"On first look at the place from the outside ,I knew it wasnt going to be Buckingham Palace.",0
"The lobby is pretty spartan,the desk clerk on duty pretty friendly-one guy in front of me at check inwas turned away as place was full-so book ahead.",0
"Was pleasantly surprised by the room-spacious,and clean.",0
"No frills,no shampoo etc one bar of soap for all your needs.",0
The mattress felt more like a water bed than a spring one,0
and I almost seemed to touch the floor as I hopped on it.,0
"Ok so125 kgs will do it-but crikey some of those bed springs had surely seen better days.Ah now for some TV-but wait no remote-125 kgs jumping up and down to change channels,is not on.",0
A trip down to reception to enquire as to whereabouts of saidremote-shrug of shoulders-our guests take them home you know set TV to CNN for duration of my stay.,0
"Off to Pike Place market-a short jaunt from the hotel-fantastic location-a few dubious characters around,but you find that in any major city.",0
Parked right across the road in a place offering a spot for only $5-had to move my car that night to see De La Hoya/Mayweather fight at local sports pub-on return garage was full-now what ?,0
no problem-park on the street for free-after 6 pmand Sunday all day free.,0
"Saturday evening and I'm winding down-Seattleites are winding up-the noise level rises to a crescendo-its now 2 a.m.A water pipe ( a prominent celing to floor fixture) in the room,not to be outdone,comes to life with a gurgle",0
and splutterand keeps this up until 5. a.m an hour after the Seattlitesdecide its time to go home.,0
I nod off into a fitful sleep.,0
Something about this hotel though-somehow its quaintand pleasant in an obscene kind of way.,0
Was almost sorry to leave-or was it teh thought of another Monday at the office looming large ?,0
Give this place a go - just catch up on sleepbefore you do.,1
"After seeing a large renovated suite in this hotel, we booked months ahead so our daughter",0
and her friends could see a concert there.,0
We confirmed it a week or so before our arrival.,0
"When we got to the front desk, we were told that we didn't have a reservation",0
and that that room was booked.,0
"We later learned that someone else had wanted the room for the whole weekend,",0
"so they had given it to them and shafted us, and were lying.",0
"They ended up giving us two smaller rooms instead,",0
"one renovated where the kids stayed,",0
and one that had not been renovated.,0
"Had difficulty locking the door to one room,",0
lock seemed out of alignment.,0
My wife hated the room.,0
"There seemed to be drag racing on the street outside until late in the morning,",0
she had trouble sleeping.,0
"The teenagers, on the other hand, were happy, and ate at the Crocodile down the street,",0
while we went to Momma's Mexican a few blocks away.,0
"Neighbourhood is dicey, but so is the whole of this area, no unpleasant encounters, though many homeless people.",0
"Parking is terrible, expensive.",0
"My boyfriend and I stayed here from Sept 2-5. We usually stay at the Springhill Suites Marriott, but decided to go the budget route.",0
"A co-worker recommended this hotel knowing I wouldn't mind the lack of amenities (bring your own soap etc.), or the poor shape it's in.",0
I have to say I wish I'd stretched the budget.,0
"The first night was fine,",0
likely because we were drunk when we went to bed so we didn't notice anything.,0
The second night I was pulling down the covers and crawling around on my pillow were 2 BED BUGS!,0
I had booked 2 beds for more space so we thoroughly inspected the other bed and slept in that one.,0
The next morning we saw another bed bug crawling around on the wall next to the bed we just slept in.,0
We took our dead bed bugs downstairs and spoke with Mike (the manager).,0
He was apologetic and claimed this was the first he'd heard of bed bugs in the Moore.,0
"We were booked to stay a third night, but were planning on going elsewhere.",0
Mike said he'd help us out with the bill and find us another room so we decided to stay.,0
The third night we came back at around 2ish.,0
The night guy assigned us a new room on the 5th floor.,0
"We dragged everything to the new room, inspected the beds, unpacked, returned the other key and went back upstairs to finally go to sleep.",0
As I pulled down the covers to go to bed I saw another bed bug crawling along the sheets.,0
This time when we killed it it exploded with blood so it had obviously made a meal out of someone.,0
"We packed up all of our belongings again, called a cab, checked out (at 3:30am), and went to stay at the Holiday Inn Express.",0
This place is a nightmare!,0
(and I'm not even a squeamish person)!,0
"We stayed at the Moore for two nights right after Memorial Day, in a standard room with 2 double beds and a private bath on the 7th floor (719).",0
"The room was huge, while sparsely decorated.",0
"The bathroom was average - small,",0
and there was a large walk-in closet.,0
"There was no air conditioning, but that seems to be the norm in Seattle.",0
The room was very clean - we could smell the cleaning supplies when we entered the room.,0
"The front desk service was great - they recommended great places to eat, order delivery, and get a shuttle to the airport.",0
The free internet terminal in the lobby was also appreciated.,0
"The location is great - not only is it walkable to many attractions, but it's in the middle of the downtown free bus zone,",0
so you don't have to walk if you don't want to.,1
Our room was approximately $100 with tax per night.,0
I'd stay there again.,0
"We stayed in The Moore in May, 2007 for 2 nights.",0
It was o.k. for the money.,0
The desk people were very friendly and helped us in any way.,0
"It is an old hotel, clean, the bathroom was in our room very small.",0
"They gave us the room we asked for, topfloor with the view to the water.",0
"Very nice, but in the morning you have the traffic.",0
We would not book in summer.,0
No A.C.!,0
Situation: 2 blocks from the market and 2 blocks to the downtown shops.,0
Perfect.,0
2 facts we didn___t like.,0
"- Boeing : 45 min busride, 1 hall with poor pieces, 2 videos, 1 was really poor, busride to the factory.",0
0,0
5h on  a platform to look down  Really: NOT TO DO - the bar in the Moore: rough.,1
"The elder lady was nice, but the  next evening, the younger ( not young !",0
") one, very unpleasant!!",0
"The MOORE is good for the money, but NOT in summer.",0
Rh.,0
We have stayed at the Moore several times over the past 8 years.,0
We were always afraid it would go the way of many downtown hotels in North America - new furniture and higher prices.,0
We have never been disappointed.,0
It has always exceeded our expectations.,0
Excellent location only 2 blocks from Pike Place markets and transport.,0
"We had refurbished room which was clean, huge and very comfortable.",0
Free guest computer with internet access and very friendly staff.,0
This hotel is exceptional value for money.,0
I stayed at the Moore for 11 nights whilst on a conference in Seattle.,0
It is in a great location - close to Pike Place Market,0
and the major central tourist attractions are within easy reach.,0
"If you like luxury, you may be disappointed, but was lucky enough to get a room with a waterfront view",0
"and it was pleasantly furnished, clean and comfortable.",0
Several of us stayed there,0
and we were all happy with the value for money and service.,0
I stayed here last month and was terribly disappointed.,0
"After reading several great reviews about the Moore on tripadvisor, I decided that this might be the best place to stay in Seattle for a great price.",0
"I ended up spending $69 a night, which is a steal for downtown Seattle.",0
However from the moment I pulled up I soon realized why it was so cheap.,0
"First of all, it is in the ghetto part of DT Seattle.",0
"There are only about 2 blocks which I would consider bad,",0
and The Moore is situated right there in the middle of the bad part of town.,0
"Second of all, we were taken back by the strong smell of pine sol when we entered our room.",0
"After leaving for the evening and returning to our room, we discovered why the pine sol scent was so strong----it was masking the smell of urine in our room!!!",0
I believe that the cleaning people tried to get rid of the urine smell by bombarding our room with cleaning supplies.,0
"I tried to air out the room,but the noise from the street down below made it unbearable to get a good night's sleep.",0
"Last but not least, no one said anything to me when I booked the room that there would not be any parking.",0
"I understand that most hotels downtown have paid parking,",0
but the Moore had nothing.,0
I had two options: 1) Leave my car on the street in the middle of the ghetto(which even the front desk was a bad idea) or 2) pay a parking garage $40 a day.,0
"My suggestion to anyone considering the Moore: If you want the low price, stay outside of DT since you will have to pay for parking anyways, or break the bank and stay at a nicer place!",1
Oh yeah- our sheets were dirty too!,0
I believe the Moore is the best budget hotel I've ever stayed in.,0
"I've stayed there four times over the past two or three years and every time I've been,",0
"my room has been clean and pleasant,",0
"the staff are friendly and helpful,",0
the beds are comfortable,0
and the location cannot be beat.,0
I always stay in the rooms with a shared bath,0
and I have always found the bathrooms to be in impeccable condition,0
and I have never once had to wait for an occupied bathroom.,0
"The hotel is located in Belltown where there are great restaurants, music clubs and bars everywhere.",0
"It's a quick walk to the Public Market, downtown or the Seattle Art Museum.",0
It's on several major bus lines that'll take you just about anywhere in the city.,0
Just remember: the Moore is a budget hotel.,0
"You do get towels, sheets and soap, but that's it.",0
"The rooms are simple, almost bare, and it does feel like the building has seen better days. There's no overnight parking which is my only real complaint about the place especially since parking is so dang expensive.",0
But for $60/night in downtown Seattle you can't expect luxury.,0
"What you do get, though, is a heck of a deal.",0
Visited Seattle first time in August- to bicycle with cascade bike club up to Vancouver ( 180km).,0
The Moore hotel was clean,0
and allowed my bicycle into the room- it was only 2 blocks from the Pike market which had all kinds of healthly foods.,0
"It is older but well kept,",0
the fan they lend you helped with the road noise and heat.,0
It is well priced for canadians who are spending candadian dollars.,0
The young fellow at front desk was a pleasure to talk with.,0
I will be doing this ride each summer and staying at this motel.,0
It was an adventure cycling from the airport to downtown- midday is the ony time to attemtp this.,0
thanks again Moore hotel!!,0
Paul,0
"We wanted a reasonably priced hotel in the middle of Seattle,",0
and we certainly got that.,0
"We got one of the suites on the 4th floor,",0
and I've got to say that it was in desperate need of an update (and I'm not picky).,0
"It seemed like they were updating some of the other floors, but they didn't get to that one yet.",0
Essentially they took 3 rooms and knocked down the walls to make a suite.,0
"Unfortunately, they only left 1 bathroom",0
and you had to walk through the bathroom to get to 1/2 the bedrooms.,0
It certainly makes it inconvenient when someone is using the bathroom!,0
It reminded me of a few apartments I had right out of college.,0
"On the good side, it was in a great location, and I never felt unsafe.",0
It's obvious that it attracts a younger crowd.,0
"When we checked in, it looked like the 1st day of college dorm check in.",0
"I would probably return, but opt for smaller rooms on the updated floors before going for the suite.",0
The hotel is very close to Pike's Place Market.,0
We went every day.,0
The rooms are simple but comfortable.,0
Our room even had a fairly big closet.,0
"It is noisy on the weekends,",0
but we brought ear plugs anyway.,0
The hotel staff was young and knowledgeable.,0
It does get booked up on the weekends these days because of all the cruise ships leaving from Seattle.,0
This hotel definitely has a hostel-feel to it.,0
I went to the Moore with a few co-workers as a getaway to see Seattle's sights.,0
"The location was perfect, being close to Pike Market, shopping and the space needle.",0
"The hotel itself is old,",0
but it accomodated very well for 4 professional twenty-something girls.,0
"The room was very clean, the beds comfortable, had a huge walk-in closet (doubles for a small bedroom, haha) and extremely affordable.",0
"I was pleased with the staff,",0
and that they were able to hold our luggage in a securely locked room after we checked out.,0
"All in all, it was a great stay!",0
Make no mistake - the Moore is pretty much a dump.,1
Its old and any improvements/repairs all look completely half baked.,0
"However, everything was functional, the price was not bad ($91 plus tax for two queens and a roll away),",0
"and I thought the location was perfect for us - close to Pikes Place market (can buy anything), the Waterfront (Bainbridge Ferry/shops, seafood restaraunts), Belltown (pubs/clubs), and the Monorail for a trip to the Space Needle area.",0
"I thought Seattle was great - plenty of specialty shops, restaraunts, coffee shops, pubs, and clubs, plus the water.",0
Loved it.,0
The Moore is located perfectly within easy walking distances of most attractions and downtown Seattle.,0
As others have described its an old place and in need of an update but its fine for the money.,0
I tried three rooms,0
"and not a single lock worked properly, took several minutes to lock the room.",0
"Receptionists are friendly and Internet access is a big plus point,",0
you'll have an ok time if you're just expecting a basic place to sleep.,0
I did not feel safe at this hotel.,0
Couples may feel more comfortable,0
but I could see the shuttle bus driver was not impressed by my hotel of choice.,0
I was booked in here for 4 nights [ a single female traveller].,0
When I got there they told me that I could only have three nights with an en suite,0
and the other night I would have to move room and share a bathroom.,0
Totally unacceptable as a lone female.,0
When I complained they told me tough move elsewhere.,0
Which I did at 6.30 the next morning [I arrived at the Moore at 10 pm too late to find somewhere else].,0
"I moved to the Inn on Queen Anne which was slightly more expensive but had a kitchenette, friendly staff and a much better vibe.",0
"I found the rating in the other reviews were good,",0
so we contacted the hotel after arriving in Seattle.,0
"We were very dissapointed: Noisy (nightclub next to building, busy street),",0
everything looks as if it wasn___t replaced or repaired the last 40 years,0
and the bed sheets showed lots of holes caused by cigarettes....,0
"In the morning we adults had an icecold shower, the kids refused to do so....",0
"Well, we paid only $130",0
but this was the highest price we ever spent on a Youth hostel style-room.,0
We will never book this hotel again!,0
We stayed here for 1 night in August,0
and it was a good deal.,0
We saved money staying in one of their shared bath suites.,0
"Convieniently, the room had its own sink.",0
The room was clean but bare of any decoration.,0
The shared bath was a little uncomfortable to use.,0
You had to walk up a tiled step before getting into the tub,0
and there were no bath matts.,0
There was no space near the tub to hang a towel.,0
We shut the window in the evening because of the noise from the street,0
but when we turned on the fan it was even louder,0
and I had to sleep with earplugs.,0
This was actually not too big of a deal.,0
The staff was very nice and helpful.,0
They recommended a nearby grocery store for late night sweets.,0
"Being able to walk to Pike Place Market, which took about 5 minutes, helped us out because we had limited sightseeing time in Seattle.",0
"To sum it up, the room was uninspiring",0
but for the location and price it was worth the 1 night stay.,0
I booked a room at the Moore for two weekend nights thinking I would get one with a shared bathroom.,0
"Well, there were issues with the shared bathrooms (I never found out what they were) so the desk clerk gave me a complimentary upgrade to a room on the 7th floor with its own very small bathroom and a view of the city and Lake Union in the distance.",0
"It was very comfortable, warm and secure (which in Belltown is always an issue)",0
and the location could not be better.,0
I will definitely be back.,0
We were surprised and disappointed at the condition of our room.,0
We would have asked to be placed in another room if our schedule would have permitted.,0
There were several stains on the carpet and furniture.,0
"The bathtub had moldy/dirty caulking,the mattress cover was not fitted and rolled up all night to the point of being very uncomfortable.",0
Our morning paper never arrived.,0
Now for our concerned part.,0
We had booked reservations at Sheraton in Hawaii prior to this experience.,0
Now we are having second thoughts of making this trip to just discover a repeat performance of disappointment.,0
Thankyou for the opportunity to review and we hope this message will help you do what is necessary to avoid anymore of the same.,0
"Room 513,9/29/07",0
Be careful of the room type if you are more than one person.,1
Husband and I were put in a room with two double beds(no kings available),0
and the beds took up most of the room.,0
Two lounge chairs were struck in the corner where you couldn't really even see the TV.,0
"Since we were going to be spending six nights, we moved to another hotel with much bigger rooms,Inn at Harbor Steps, which I highly recommend.",0
Location was very central,0
and great for shopping and the linens and bed were very comfortable.,0
"Staff very nice, but couldn't change the room.",0
My wife and I stayed for one night over this past Veterans Day/Rememberance Day weekend.,0
We booked this hotel through priceline at a very low rate.,0
"This is certainly a good hotel,",0
"and a very good value considering the rate we got through priceline.com,",0
but we didn't find anything particularly special about it.,0
"When we arrived, we found that there was no self parking available, only valet parking.",0
"The cost of valet service wasn't really a problem here, but considering the size of the hotel, and the number of guests coming and leaving, there is a lot of congestion in the front and a considerable wait time.",0
Check-in service was quick and friendly.,0
The room was clean and comfortable.,0
"I read that when the hotel was renovated in 2002,",0
each room was furnished with some Chihuly drawings.,0
They can be seen in the attached photos.,0
"The hotel is very central to a lot of good shopping centres, Pike Street Market, and lot of great restaurants.",0
"So overall, no complaints, it is a very good hotel.",0
"However, for reference, I stayed at the Seattle Grand Hyatt in January 2005 - that was a fantastic hotel - but costs a lot more too.",0
My husband and I stayed at the Sheraton Seattle a few weeks ago.,0
"The lobby was not open (still under renovation, I guess) when we arrived, so the reception and concierge desks were shoved into a crowded hallway.",0
"Check in went smoothly,",0
and we were given a room promptly even,0
though we arrived a few hours before the official check-in time.,0
"When we got to our room, we went to use the bathroom",0
and the toilet was FILTHY!,0
"I will spare you the details,",0
but clearly it had not been cleaned after the last guest.,0
"Housekeeping did respond quickly and cleaned the entire bathroom,",0
but that negative first impression still lingers.,0
"The rest of the room was OK - typical decor, above average bed, decent view of the city from our 20th floor room.",0
The major strength of the Sheraton Seattle is its location.,0
It is basically across the street from the convention center - perfect it you are attending a conference.,0
It is only a few blocks from Pike Place Market and lots of restaurants and shops.,0
"There is a restaurant and a bar at the hotel, but I didn't visit either.",0
No place to get a quick cup of coffee at the Sheraton though.,0
"I tried to get take out coffee from the restaurant,",0
but the request seemed to confuse everyone.,0
It took about 20 minutes for them to figure out how to sell me some coffee in a paper cup.,0
I couldn't believe it was so difficult to get a cup of coffee in SEATTLE!,0
Luckily there are coffee shops on every corner once you leave the hotel.,0
"Overall, the Sheraton Seattle was OK.",0
"Its location made up for its weaknesses,",0
but that is only because I was attending a conference and appreciated the proximity to the convention center.,0
"If I were going back to Seattle just for vacation, I would probably try a different hotel.",0
I booked this Sheraton hotel in downtown Seattle via Hotwire for two nights.,0
Arrived at the hotel at around 11:30am and asked for early check-in.,0
The front desk staff was nice.,0
"Upon seeing my SPG Gold membership card, she checked me in, even though technically Hotwire bookings do not qualify for SPG Gold benefits.",0
The room and amenities are what you would normally expect from a 4-star Sheraton.,0
The best thing about this hotel is its location.,0
"It's just a few blocks walk to the Pike Place market, the water front.",0
Monorail station is just 2 blocks away.,0
Plenty of shopping and restaurant nearby.,0
I usually leave a decent tip everyday with a Thank you note in the room for the maid when I stay in a hotel.,0
"This is on one hand customary, on the other hand I hope if I accidentally leave something behind,",0
the maid cleaning the room will be nice enough to turn it in.,0
"The first day, the maid took the tip and left me a thank you note.",0
"The second day, I left the tip and checked out at around noon.",0
"That evening, I discovered that I had forgotten my laptop power adapter in the Sheraton hotel room.",0
I called the hotel immediately.,0
"The guest service rep took my room number, dates of stay, name and phone number, and said that they would call me if someone turns it in.",0
There was no indication that they are trying to look for it.,0
"I expect at least they should 1) if the room has not been rented out, send someone to check; or 2) if the room was rented out, send a message to the new guest.",0
One week passed and no phone call.,0
I called again because I was about to pass through Seattle.,0
The guest service simply said that we have your inquiry on file.,0
"If it turns up, we will call you.",0
Again no indication of any willingness to help.,0
"I know that leaving something behind is my mistake,",0
but I am still disappointed that the hotel guest service is not as helpful as a 4-star hotel should be.,0
Stayed here for 2 nights.,0
It was expensive (parking is $35/night),0
but it's only 5 blocks from Pike Place and roughly a 20 min walk to the Harbor Steps.,0
You can catch the monorail a block from the hotel if you want to visit the Seattle Center.,1
We stayed in the tower facing Union St which has been remodeled.,0
We had a plasma in our king room,0
and the furniture is contemporary.,0
Really liked the room and had no problems with noise.,0
"If you don't mind spending a little, it's a great stay.",0
Just make sure you stay in the remodeled section.,1
And the concierge was extremely helpful.,0
"I believe the lobby has free wireless,",0
but it may cost to connect in the room.,0
The only reason I give a 4/5 stars is the ridiculous parking cost.,0
I know it's a major city and it's downtown,0
but I still think it's too high.,0
Enjoyed a great local package deal with the hotel (check out their local website first for rates).,0
Our room was located on the upper (old) tower floors and in need of updating.,0
The room and beds (not comfortable) showed wear and looked the same as when I last stayed (90's),0
but the view and staff were outstanding.,0
The hotel has a new updated tower (no high floors) and lost it's parking space-thus now only offers expensive valet parking at 35.00 +tax.,0
The parking attendants were working hard but still have to wait outside in the cold for your car.,0
"If we choose to return, we would stay in the new tower and park the car across the street.",0
"Overall, an average stay with below average beds.",0
I travel for a living,0
and this was the worst hotel experience I have ever had.,0
"I stayed in this hotel in November, 2005.",0
The room was on climate control,0
and it was very cold.,0
"On the first day,the shower pressure was so low that I couln't wash the conditioner out of my hair.",0
"The second day, I was unable to take a shower because the water was either very hot or cold.",0
It would not reach a warm temperature.,0
"When I asked the clerk at the front desk, he said that the hotel was under construction",0
and all of the pipes were messed up.,0
Room service at breakfast was 1/2 hour late,0
and the server showed up just as I was leaving to attend a meeting.,0
I did not have time to eat.,0
I tried to have a quick cup of coffee,0
but it was stone cold.,0
I had to argue with the staff to take the meal off my bill.,0
"Two personal items of mine were taken from my room and again,",0
the staff argued.,0
I spent two hours in the business center preparing business related emails.,0
The center took my $50,0
and then notified me that the emails could not be delivered due to technical difficulties.,0
"When I approached the front desk for assistance, I was told that there was nothing they could do, and literally responded that it was not they're problem.",0
Fifty dollars were added to my bill for items from the mini-bar which I did not order.,0
It was explained that I was charged for items from the previous customer.,0
"When I questioned how they did this, the staff argued with me rudely and insulted me.",0
A client of mine reserved the room and intended to pay for it.,0
I became aware at check out that they had charged my credit card.,0
The staff shugged their shoulders and stated that that was the way they did things.,0
"Since the arrangement was for the client to pay for expenses, the hotel staff made him come down to the hotel with his credit card and to add insult to injury, made him fill out a long document which delayed an appointment by 10 minutes.",0
"As someone who travels internationally, he commented on the rude and hostile behavior of the clerk.",0
I left a note for the general manager and asked for his comments.,0
I also left a telephone message for him,0
but he never returned my call.,0
"Not only would I never stay in this hotel again,",0
but I will never patronize another Sheraton establishment.,0
This was our third time staying at the Sheraton Hotel in Downtown Seattle,0
and it was our third time being disappointed.,0
Our first two trips to this hotel were both Christmas trips (2005 and 2006),0
and our last trip was during the last week of August 2007.,0
The first year that we booked this hotel we called them directly (after booking our room with an on-line service) to comfirm that they were the same hotel that hosts the famous Ginger Bread House competition for the local chefs.,0
"Once we arrived to the hotel,",0
"we were very surprised to find that the hotel was not only in shambles from being under construction,",0
but that they had moved the Ginger Bread houses to another location entirely (an imprortant fact that they forgot to mention when we were calling to confirm that the Ginger Bread houses were indeed going to be there).,0
On our second Christmas trip we decided to try bidding on a hotel with priceline.com.,0
We were a little disappointed when we found out that the hotel that accepted our bid was the Sheraton.,0
We decided that we would look on the bright side though and give the hotel a second chance.,0
"We thought that there was no way that the hotel could still be under construction,",0
but once again we were greeted with the confusion and mess of construction.,0
The place was a mess,0
and the Ginger Bread Houses were still no where to be found.,0
This last trip (and it will be the last) we tried hotwire.com for the first time.,0
And once again we ended up with the Sheraton.,0
I again decided that I would be optimistic and hope for the best.,0
I can say that I was happy to see that the lobby,0
"and new tower were no longer a construction zone,",0
but I was still very disappointed with the floor that we stayed on,0
and the room we were given.,0
The table outside of the elevator had garbage on it,0
and the hallway had bits of garbage all throughout that no one bothered to clean up during our stay.,0
The room that they gave us looked out into the alley,0
and there was scaffolding hanging outside of our window all three days that we were there.,0
Not at all what I would expect from a four star hotel.,0
I think that their star rating should be brought down a notch or two.,0
"Needless to say, I don't think that we will be staying at the Sharaton any time soon.",0
We got a rate of $99 on Priceline.,0
They put us in a hospitality suite with two roll-aways!,0
"On the other hand, the cots were comfortable and the room, strange as it looked, was bigger than a regular room.",0
"The front desk is disorganized,",0
the lobby is outrageously crowded and bustling with groups.,0
Theres a nice view from the pool/health club.,0
The location is good for touring.,0
Theres no place for breakfast.,0
"I would never consider staying here for rack rate but for a priceline stay, it's fine.",0
Stayed here for 3 nights in July 2004.,0
Found it as you would expect for a large chain hotel.,0
"Large, smart lobby, check in staff advised us on safe areas to walk at night on arrival.",0
However they were unable to locate the safe we apparantly had in our room!,0
"Friendly attendant in the swimming pool/gym, although lots of kids in the pool.",0
Room fine - clean  fair size.,0
I was extremely disappointed with my stay at Seattle Sheraton.,0
"The service was horrendous,",0
"the beds were improperly made,",0
front desk had attitude.,0
There was no concierge,0
and the business center was not available because of construction.,0
I travel 3 of 4 weeks a month and found this property to be less than satisfactory,0
and the service provided was unpleasant.,0
"The front desk compensated us with 3 $15 food credits for the bedding problems, which were never corrected.",0
The beds are short sheeted which causes the bed to unravel,0
and we found our selves sleeping on the bare mattress (disgusting) when we woke up in the morning.,0
"The $15 food credits did not satisfy us due to the poor quality of food, service and cleanliness.",0
"The food in the restaurant was cold,",0
"service was slow, and each time I ate in there (the first when we didn't know any better and the 2nd 2nd time was because of the food coupons) - either the silverware was dirty or the water glasses",0
"and coffee cups were dirty,",0
and expensive breakfast buffet for $25. The pool area was poorly ventilated,0
"and I cut my foot on a broken drain cover in the whirlpool,",0
shortly after that a young boy sliced his foot open,0
and a house doctor was called.,0
I mentioned my foot at check out the next morning,0
and all they said was they were sorry.,0
The noise from the construction was annoying at 6am,0
"and we were not notified in advance that services promised (business center, concierge) would not be available.",0
Parking at $28 was obscene and the $1.50 for 6 oz.,0
bottle of water in the vending machine was ridiculous - the picture showed a full size water bottle.,0
Horrible - absolutely horrible.,0
My family and I stayed here during what will be remembered as one of the worst winters Seattle has seen in recent memory.,0
"Fortunately, the Sheraton is a few blocks away from great shopping and walking through the snow wasn't bad at all.",0
"In fact, we had to walk to all of our destinations because the Taxi's",0
and Public Transportation system were not running at full capacity.,0
"We even walked to Pike's Place and the Aquarium one day and the Seattle Center another (yeah, the monorail was down also!).",0
Still quite bearable from the Sheraton and my son thought running through all the snow was a blast.,0
"A few interesting things I noticed, lots of people smoking,",0
and it didn't seem that most folks walking around were very friendly or courteous at all.,0
I got the feeling that if I didn't get out of someone's way they'd walk into me.,0
Maybe I just thought Seattle would be a little friendlier given the great reputation they have as being such a liveable place.,0
The room was nice and comfortable.,0
About what you'd expect from a four star hotel.,0
Service was okay but not quite the same as a Grand Hyatt or similar.,0
"From what I understand we stayed in the newer renovated tower which is supposed to be much nicer than the other, older tower.",0
"We were nearly at the top so views, while not spectacular, weren't bad since you see above most everything other building.",0
I'd suggest staying away from the in hotel restaurant.,1
Quite expensive and service was mediocre.,0
Just across the street is a ChesseCake Factory which is a much better deal for nearly the same quality of food.,0
Only problem is that the Factory doesn't open for breakfast.,0
"My suggestion would be to have a donut and coffee for breakfast, you're in Seattle after all!",1
There really aren't too many simple places to eat in the near vicinity unless you go to the food courts in one of the shopping centers nearby.,0
The ones we went to seemed to be quite upscale so even the food court can be a bit pricey given the type of food served.,0
All in all a pleasant stay.,0
"Park across the street, $6 for 24hrs on weekends, $35+ at the hotel.",1
"Check-in was efficient, mechanically so, but painless.",0
Stayed in the old tower 10th floor.,0
Nize size rooms with adequate bath.,0
"Quiet, comfy bed.",0
"However, room smelled like wet-dog a bit.",0
The tub also had long black hair stuck to it (gross).,0
"Location is perfect for that part of the city , close to all.",0
I would stay there again at deal rates but would probably ask for new tower to hopefully avoid odor which was not offensive enough to change rooms but a little yucky!,0
It was the worse stay we had ever had at a hotel.,0
They were no help to us at all.,0
"The concierge had no idea about the sites in the city, how to get there and espically how to get back.",0
"After finding a concierge who knew where Fishermans Terminal was she advised taking a cab, which we did.",0
Not knowing that the cabs did not return to that area.,0
We were stuck there for over one hour after calling the hotel for assistance and having them tell use there was nothing they could do.,0
Saw other guests who were also upset.,0
My boyfriend and I attended the Penny Arcade Expo in the Wash.,0
"State Convention Center this summer, and the Sheraton was in the best possible location.",0
This was one of its sole redeeming factors.,0
"While the room was spacious,",0
"and the furniture was beautiful and well-made,",0
the linens were of the cheapest quality.,0
The towels were thin and scratchy;,0
there were no robes.,0
"Our pillowcases were stained,",0
and the room had not been very thoroughly cleaned.,0
We were paying nearly three hundred dollars a night and had booked the room for four straight nights.,0
"We considered this cost, though fairly staggering for us, to be worth it.",0
"However, when we got there,",0
we were constantly nickel-and-dimed.,0
Over thirty dollars a day for parking.,0
"What respectable hotel, especially one with such expensive rooms, would have the gall to also charge lodging for their guests' cars?",0
"For what we paid for those rooms, they should have been courteous enough not to ream us on parking.",0
"Added to that were the $10/day charge for internet, which I could have gotten for free at just about any coffee shop,",0
and the pay-per-view movies which cost between $10 and $15 dollars each.,0
I understand that these are luxury services,0
"and that some fees usually apply,",0
but the blatant avarice of the Sheraton on such matters when they were clearly not hurting for revenue was just appalling.,0
"Besides their convenient location, I would mention that the attentiveness, friendliness, and efficiency of the staff with whom we interacted were consistently excellent, and it is this, more than anything, that prompts me to give more than one star.",0
"The parking attendants in particular were very helpful with allowing us access to the garage if we needed to get to the car, but weren't going anywhere in it.",0
"I recommend this hotel only if you don't mind blithely throwing money around, and if you bring your own towels.",0
"Next year, we are trying somewhere else.",0
"We go to Seattle often,",0
but this was the first time we stayed at the Sheraton.,0
"I chose it because of the positive reviews I read on TripAdvisor,",0
the fantastic promo they had on their website ($129 + tax for the weekend) and the location.,0
"I was really impressed with their renovated modern lobby,",0
it felt similar to the W (another Starwood hotel) but larger.,0
"The staff was more mature  friendlier than the W. There's ample seating in the lobby to read the newspaper, an area of computers for guests, a takeout cafe/bakery and a restaurant/grill...from what I saw.",0
"We requested the renovated Union St Tower and were really happy with the room - decent downtown view, new furnishings, very comfortable and contemporary.",0
"There was a flatscreen TV, Starbucks coffee and Bliss products in the room.",0
To make it even better they should add robes,0
and a complimentary bottle of water - the tap water was too chlorinated,0
"and the mini bar bottled water was $4. The location is perfect because it's so close to Pike Place market, downtown shopping and the great restaurants in Belltown.",0
"Everything that we needed was within 1 block or 2: bank, coffee shop, pharmacy, great stores  parking.",0
We parked in the Convention Centre lot for $24/night versus paying $35/night at the hotel.,0
The Centre is safe because it's either packed with cars during the day or closed at night.,0
We ate at some fantastic restaurants: Tavolata and Union.,0
"There's a cool lounge around the corner from the hotel called Vessel with great cocktails, music and interior.",0
For breakfast we ate at the market (lots of options),0
but didn't have a good experience at Cafe Campagne...,0
we waited 45 min for breakfast,0
and then it was served cold.,0
To top it off they weren't too apologetic.,0
I was expecting a lot from this hotel.,0
Especially for the price.,0
"Check in time was at 3:00 P.M. and we couldn't get into our room until 6:00 P.M. because ""it wasn't ready.""",0
I called a number of times,0
while we were out on the street,0
and they left me on hold twice and couldn't get a manager to the phone.,0
Really unprofessional.,0
They finally moved us to another room.,0
I asked them why the room wasn't ready,0
"and it was ""because it wasn't."" I asked if this was acceptable service to them",0
and they had no response.,0
"The manager worked really hard and offered up the sincerest ""sorry"" he could muster.",0
"They offered me ""points""",0
and I asked them why should I take points for a hotel that was satisfied with such a low level of service,0
and they didn't know.,0
"Finally, the manager offered me $50 off my bill.",0
I shrugged my shoulders and said why not.,0
"We paid extra for a ""sweeping view of the city""",0
and the attached picture is what we got.,0
I am wondering if we were being punished for complaining.,0
I really didn't want to complain.,0
I really wanted to settle it all on the phone,0
while we were waiting on the street.,0
"The room is on the ""Club Level"" and is about on par with a Radisson.",0
It is a small room with a small bathtub.,0
Holiday Inn Express has better service.,0
No one told us the gym was closed.,0
No word about it on their webpage.,0
"So after all that, no pool, hot tub or gym.",0
The big message from the front desk is that they are too busy and don't care.,0
It is just like being at that job you were trying to get away from.,0
I travel to Seattle and have stayed in a number of hotels there -- notably the Edgewater and Monaco.,0
I stayed at the Sheraton this time primarily due to an internet price offer and the 4 star rating of the hotel.,0
But it's clear that the Sheraton sheds all it's normal charges in order to make the rm price look cheap --,0
while my quote was abt $200 a night -- in fact I paid abt $300 a night.,0
On a two night stay that's a big surprise.,0
"Valet parking is $35 a night,",0
and their non-valet parking is $28 a night and a block away.,0
"To be fair, Seattle parking in general is way overpriced -- comparable to NYC (where at least it seems merited).",0
Internet is $9.95 per day.,0
If you send packages ahead (as many of us business travelers do) you are charged on a sliding scale based on weight -- that added another $60 to my bill.,0
AND they lost the most important box of the lot.,0
"While they made some visible efforts to look for the box -- the fact is that Fedex showed the box signed for,",0
and their own system had logged it in --,0
but they could not locate.,0
I've had better help at Motel 6 -- and they don't charge anything for internet or boxes.,0
"The room was a perfectly normal hotel room; ditto with bathroom -- in short,",0
"there is nothing here that special,",0
"they are overpriced, and service in this case was subpar.",0
"Also they seem to cater to conventions, large groups, so there are long waits for everything (elevator, bell boy, cashier, etc., and there usually 20 - 30 people out front smoking and blocking doorways.",0
"Everyone has their hand out (not unusual at a hotel like this, but even more blatant here -- and without much of a smile or effort) When I have to open my trunk and pack my bags in the car, it seems impertinent to be expecting a tip just for bringing the car up.",0
"Will not repeat this hotel, and frankly hurt my impression of Sheraton overall as well.",0
I have had much more consistent and better visits at Hiltons lately.,0
One small note -- there is a great Vietnamese restaurant around the corner called Bambuza -- don't miss it!,1
It was the highlight of this trip.,0
"I was here for a week in June,",0
and it was my fifth stay in 10 years.,0
It has gone downhill in recent years.,0
The nice restaurant is gone (but there are many close to the hotel).,0
The lobby and rooms were a little shabby.,0
I had to have lights replaced and something else repaired.,0
It took forever to check in- only one person at the counter.,0
"I didn't get a mini bar key at check-in, or for 3 hours after requesting one (and boy did I need a beer after being delayed on Alaska Air!).",0
I had to call 3 times for the key and 2 for the lightbulb.,0
I got a $20 certificate for the inconvenience.,0
"Room service is very quick,",0
but the quality is poor.,0
"Same exact food if you are at the cafe, room service or catering a banquet.",0
I have catered events at this hotel,0
and they used to be great.,0
Can't beat the view on the 35th floor.,0
This year the food was barely good.,0
The pool is indoors upstairs and has a strong chlorine smell that wafts to the fancy ballroom.,0
Rooms are very small.,0
Beds are comfy.,0
"For $200 I would like a turn down and chocolate, decent room service and not have to spend a fortune on the phone or internet acess.",0
"Good location, but there are many other hotels around.",0
We stayed in the Union Street tower (new standard king room) and found it to be very nice!!,0
"We are usually Westin or W people, but decided to check out one of the new rooms here.",0
Love the new design and the subway tiles in the bathroom.,0
Bed and linens were on par with the Westin Heavenly Bed.,0
I slept like a baby and am extremely particular about bedding.,0
Curtains made the room completely dark - perfect for sleeping in!,0
"It was quite posh,",0
and I would consider this hotel over the Westin aand W Seattle next time we are in town.,0
"And yup, parking is expensive everywhere in SEA.",0
that's just how it is!,0
Be careful with this hotel.,1
They will cheat you.,0
When I called to make a reservation for a government conference I was told the hotel was completely sold out.,0
I requested to be put on a waiting list,0
and they took my name.,0
A few days later a co-worker called and was able to book a room and received the government rate.,0
I called the hotel and asked why I wasn't called.,0
They gave me the run around and said an opening came up.,0
"I asked if an an opening came up, why didn't they call me since I was on the waiting list.",0
They agreed to give me a room (hmmm...thought they were sold out) but said they couldn't accomodate all the nights of my stay.,0
But they would not give me the government rate even,0
though they gave it to my co-worker who called AFTER I did.,0
There is major construction going on at this hotel.,0
"In addition, the hotel is not very nice.",0
"They don't have a business center, gift shop, or wireless internet.",0
They only have one place to eat,0
and the prices are outrageous for very average food.,0
"Whatever you do, don't stay at this hotel.",1
There are many other nice hotels who will accomodate their guests.,0
The Seattle Sheraton has no sense of customer service.,0
Avoid this hotel!,1
We stayed at the Sheraton for two nights after our Alaskan cruise.,0
"We found a nice big room, with a comfortable bed, new linens, very clean and modern bathroom.",0
No noise from the construction.,0
"Maybe because it was on a weekend,",0
but we found the hotel very quiet for its size,0
and the crowd that always seemed to be coming and going in the lobby.,0
Good location for shopping.,0
Easy access to highways.,0
Easy walk from Pike's market.,0
Would stay here again.,0
"My husband and I work for a luxury hotel company so,",0
our viewpoint is a bit different than other customers.,0
"Regardless, there are a few good things to mention.",0
"We enjoyed the location of the hotel, no doubt.",0
The beds were very comfortable,0
"and if you stay on the 30th floor or above,",0
the views are spectacular.,0
We had a very low rate of $89/night through Priceline with an upgrade to club for only $30/night.,0
"However, we were a little disappointed with the selection and quality of food served in the club.",0
Our main concern with this property was that the staff overall was not very pleasant.,0
It seemed that we were a nuisance to most we came in contact with,0
and timeliness of service was an issue as well.,0
"Of course, the valet was pricey, but we read the reviews ahead of time and worked it into our budget.",0
This Sheraton is definitely not a 4-star hotel,0
and we had looked forward to a high level of service due to the fact that we work for a 5-star hotel ourselves.,0
"So, we would recommend this property if you are happy with 3-star hotels or lower.",1
I go to Seattle at least 4 or 5 times a year for pleasure.,0
I generally stay at the Sheraton because I liked the rooms,0
and service it is right downtown convenient for walking.,0
I was very disappointed in the service since they remodeled their lobby.,0
The best service was from the Valets.,0
That was it.,0
"The front desk employees were rude, whether it was on the phone or in person, didn't matter.",0
They just had this attitude that was not appreciated!,0
It started on the phone when I tried to get a room through Sheraton.,0
The rate fluctuated with each phone call and I made 3 of them.,0
I ended up calling and talking to the manager about the reservations department.,0
"First I was told that there was a military rate,",0
"then I was told that there wasn't one,",0
then that there was only a military rate for the actual active military man and not the spouse.,0
Which doesn't make sense.,0
I gave up.,0
"didn't book a room, set my mind that I wouldn't try to stay there again.",0
There are plenty of nice hotels in Seattle.,0
"We decided to priceline, got the rate we were looking for without the military discount and ended up at the Sheraton anyways!!!",0
Fate!!,0
Still the service sucked!,0
Rude staff and to top it off you have to pay for the Wi Fi!!!,0
I won't make any effort to stay at the Sheraton again!!,0
I stayed at the Sheraton in Seattle one day before a cruise.,0
The hotel is in a perfect location to walk to many downtown restaurants and shops.,0
The hotel is under construction so the entrance is poorly marked on the side side of the hotel.,0
The taxi driver could not pull up to the curb due to construction materials in the street.,0
There was no one there to help me with my luggage and no ramp up from the street.,0
Only after I made it to the lobby was I offered help with the luggage.,0
Too late!,0
"Check in was a breeze, less than 5 minutes.",0
There are two sets of elevators depending on which floor you are on,0
and I was directed to the wrong set.,0
Fortunately I caught the error before getting on.,0
The room was clean and standard but outdated in shades of buff and yellow.,0
There is no gift/sundry shop due to the construction,0
and the restaurant/bar is just a cordoned off section of the lobby.,0
I might try the Seattle Sheraton after the construction,0
and refurbishment is finished but not before then.,0
Even thought I secured what I felt was a very reasonable rate on Hotwire I do not feel the hotel was worth the price.,0
I stayed at the Sheraton for four days in May 2005.,0
The goods: Location: Great.,0
Walking distance to almost everything you'd want to see in the downtown area.,0
Rooms: Really nice.,0
Light soothing decor.,0
Very comfortable bed with a variety of pillows.,0
coffee maker.,0
Concierge: Very helpful The bads:Elevators: -- not enough and very slowCoffee shop: -- ridiculously expensive.,0
There is a $20 breakfast buffet that didn't look spectacular.,0
"I only wanted oatmeal,",0
juice and coffee so ordered from the menu.,0
The bill was still $20.Desk staff: Well -- After being notified by phone message at 5:00p.,0
"m.on Friday night that a fax was waiting for me at the front desk (the business center was closed), when I went to get it, the staff couldn't find it after 15 minutes of searching.",0
I told the desk person to find it,0
and I would pick it up after dinner.,0
At 9 p.m. I asked again.,0
"After 20 minutes the desk person said, that must have been a duplicate message",0
and there was no fax.,0
I said I doubted that and said that I was expecting a fax.,0
"I asked that the fax, when found, be delivered to my room.",0
At 10:00 p.m. the fax was slipped under my door.,0
It had actually been received at the hotel at 10:00a.,0
m. on Thursday morning -- 36 hours before I received it.,0
As it was after business hours there was nothing I could do about the important message that needed a timely response.,0
I complained to the manager on duty the next morning,0
and she did apologize,0
and she credited $75 against my hotel bill.,0
That did not compensate for the cost to me because I couldn't respond to the fax.,0
Would I stay there again -- Maybe.,0
"It was better and less expensive than the W Hotel, where I stayed a couple of years ago.",0
You can't beat the Sheraton on 6th Avenue in Seattle for proximity to all things downtown.,0
"Anything you could think of that's located off of I-5's ""Downtown Exits"" is a few blocks away, even Pike Place Market, great restaurants, music venues, shopping (including Nordstrom's flagship store)...ok, so why did I rate the hotel ""Okay, but some problems""?",0
"In one word, PARKING.",0
We travel on a budget and were lucky to get 2 nights at a discount rate,0
and so we decided to splurge....what we DIDN'T know is that overnight parking in the Sheraton's garage is $40 per night.,0
$40. That's dinner for 2 every night!!,0
Don't get me wrong.,0
The room was FANTASTIC.,0
"Never heard any of the other occupants, great bathroom and toiletries, fantastic amenities for guests in the lobby (including a great coffee/breakfast-to-go/sandwich place with rockin' breakfast sandwiches at affordable prices) and lots of computers, lots of staff, great bellmen...... but at a normal price of about $350 per room a night, an extra $40 for parking doesn't leave you with a great taste in your mouth....",0
more like a bitter sip of bad coffee at the end of a great meal.,0
"Still a good meal, but still something that leaves you wanting the taste of something sweeter at the end.",0
"Now, if you are one of the luckies that has an extra $40 per night to spend....don't hesitate.",0
Great hotel.,0
You won't be disappointed.,0
Absolutely don't stay at this hotel if you're driving.,1
"Parking is valet-only which is $35/night, but they double-charge you w/an additional $35/night for parking.",0
If you don't mind paying $70/night (excluding gratuities) for parking go ahead.,0
We live in a Seattle suburb and wanted to stay downtown for a wedding.,0
I selected a 4 star in downtown Seattle on priceline for $99. The reservation was accurate,0
and there were no problems at check in.,0
We were given a king bed in the old tower.,0
The room was large with a comfortable bed.,0
"However, under the duvet was a traditional old blanket.",0
Who knows when it was last washed...,0
I was surprised to see that in such a high end chain hotel.,0
The other motel like feature were thin and rough towels.,0
Valet parking was $35,0
and wired internet was $10.,0
Stayed during a business meeting; was upgraded to a club level room.,0
I was expecting something nice,0
but really could not tell the difference between a standard room and a club level room(if you asked).,0
The beds were comfortable,0
and the bathroom was alright.,0
"Put the AC on high, but the room still felt like a sauna.",0
The hotel staff were very courteous,0
and the valet staff had their work cut out for them...,0
"Overall: If you are coming to Seattle on vacation,",0
I would go somewhere more unique.,0
"If it's for business, I guess this place is alright",0
I booked this hotel on hotwire and got a great price of 107 p/n for a weekend.,0
"Our room was clean,",0
nice and the staff was very friendly.,0
"The beds were so comfortable,it was hard to get up in the morning.",0
Tip- Upgrade for $30.00 to the club level and it includes 2 free breakfast buffets ( 43.00 savings ) The facilities are great the pool,0
"and jacuzzi were fantastic,",0
the cardio room was nice,0
but I didn't have time to take advantage of it.,0
All and all we had a great stay!,0
Can't wait to go back !!!!,0
Booked Sheraton for one night through hotwire as I extended my stay in Seattle,0
and the Westin was booked out where i had been staying for 5 nights.,0
Really nice hotel.,0
"For the price I paid I wasn't expecting a nice room, but the one I was allocated on the 12th floor I was very pleased with.",0
"Very comfortable bed, lovely furnishings, really large wardrobe, nice ammenties.",0
"Location is great...there is a cheesecake factory right near the hotel,",0
and although I didn't get time to drink there - the lobby bar looked really inviting.,0
I'd definitely stay here again.,0
We stayed here for 2 nights after a cruise and were quite pleased.,0
Got it via Hotwire for around $130/night (more like $155 including taxes),0
and subsequently read some reviews about construction noise so had some concerns.,0
Not an issue.,0
Our room was on the 25th floor and was quite nice.,0
A typical conference hotel.,0
"Located in an area with lots of nice shops and restaurants, particularly in a shopping center only 1 block away.",0
Also an easy walk to Pike Place market and the waterfront.,0
The Greyline tour buses and airport shuttle have a desk in the lobby,0
and it was convenient as we took a tour to Mount Ranier one day,0
and also used the shuttle to get to the airport.,0
"The room was fairly spacious with a big window ledge you could set things on, a large table for a desk, two chairs and a table for a reading corner, 2 beds with comfortable bedding.",0
Attractive decor.,0
We checked out the pool,0
and it was OK.,0
Kind of small and very crowded with families both times we went.,0
The whole pool is 4 feet deep -- no shallow or deep end.,0
My only minor complaint was that it was difficult to access the free internet.,0
They had one computer located at the check-in desk,0
and I had to check 4 times before it was available.,0
"Seattle Sheraton listed as a 4 Star, Beware not even close, maybe a 2 if that.",0
Went to Seattle for our Aniversary.,0
"They put us in a small room, with a horrible view.",0
"The worst thing was the beds were so small,",0
we had to sleep in seperate beds!!!!,0
"The Pool, Spa, And exercise facility's are all closed and will not reopen until October,",0
I think is the month the lady at the front desk said.,0
"She was very rude, and said the Hotel had notified Priceline of the facility closures.",0
"Our room was not cleaned properly,",0
"towels looked like they were thrown on the hooks, dirty glasses not exchanged,",0
beds looked horrible and the pillows were on the floor???,0
Better bring alot of extra cash.,0
Stayed 2 days parking was 56 bucks.,0
"The water in the room is not drinkable,",0
However you can buy there's $$$$.,0
"Food in over cooked, at least the water in cafe was drinkable, and don't be fooled by there complimentary newspaper, if you read the sticker the put on it you will see that you will be charged for it to $$$$.",1
Thanks for our ruined Aniversary Seattle Sheraton.,0
Next time We will stay at the Camlin or one of the other real 4 Star hotels in the same area!!!!!!!!,0
"Rooms are spacious, clean and elegant.",0
"Great hotel Lobby and pretty big hotel with numerous elevators, so you dont have to wait much.",0
The Sheraton Hotel is in a prime location in the heart of downtown Seattle.,0
It is so convenient for shopping and an easy stroll away from the Pike Place Market.,0
I have stayed at the hotel many times,0
and the staff have always been professional and courteous.,0
The opening of the new Pine Street tower and completion of the lobby renovations have added to the attractiveness of the hotel.,0
The room decor is very comfortable,0
and furnishings are well thought out.,0
I really liked the new Bliss Mandarin Mint bath products.,0
I had to stay at this hotel for two weeks for my job,0
"and the hotel was wonderful,",0
the service was great the only mistake was one day the room was not clean when I returned that afternoon,0
but the service desk quickly fix that error and offered my a free movie.,0
My wife and I did a lot of walking,0
and the hotel is in a great area of town.,0
The Market and Mall are all in walking distance,0
and if you wanted to take a long stroll you could even walk to the tower.,1
I've stayed at the Sheraton Seattle numerous times on business over the last 3 years.,0
"I used to really enjoy it,",0
but it has progressively gone down hill in my opinion.,0
"Unfortunately,.",0
"my last stay will likely be my last, despite the location, which is closest to my office.",0
"This last visit the hotel was packed, so there was a huge wait to check in, even late at night, and with my SPG status.",0
"The room I received was one of the larger suites,",0
but it was really just a huge waste of space.,0
The layout of the furniture was spartan at best.,0
"Most disturbingly, the room reeked of mildew and the linens seemed old and tired, long overdue for replacement.",0
"This property is undergoing an expansion, so construction noise was also a problem.",0
"After 1 night, the mildew was aggravating my allergies, so i asked to be switched to a different room.",0
"The room I was moved to was tiny, cramped and dark, and the view looked out on to a lower rooftop, where at 6 am,",0
a construction crew convened.,0
"At $279 a night, I expect more.",0
I won't be staying at this Sheraton again anytime soon.,0
Lovely room.,0
We were disappointed when we checked in,0
and I asked where the pool is located to be told the pool is closed for remodeling until September or October.,0
"I had called the Starwood reservations line directly in July and asked which of the Starwood hotels in Seattle had the best pool, picked the Sheraton based on their advice, told my daughter that she could go swimming,",0
only to find it was closed.,0
They did tell us we could go down and use the pool at the Westin,0
but that just seemed like a mission since we only had one full day in Seattle at the tail end of this trip.,0
"Pool issue aside, there is a lot to like about this hotel.",0
"We were supposed to be on the club floor, but had been moved to the union tower as we arrived after midnight I wasnt in the mood to make a fuss.",0
We still got club room amenities - the breakfast was great,0
and the staff were super.,0
We were told that the union tower rooms were newer and nicer,0
"and we did have a lovely room with two very comfy beds, a flat screen tv and a nice bathroom.",0
There was a nice big desk area and two comfortable chairs in a seating area.,0
The decor is quite masculine - sort of comfortable modern look I suppose,0
but it all worked and felt really comfortable.,0
"The lobby is really fun with a computer area, lots of comfortable seating,",0
and these neat microsoft tables that are like huge touch screens with local maps etc. They were pretty cool.,0
"The location is great,",0
"we walked down to Pike market, walked over and caught the monorail to the Space Needle.",0
We went up the space needle which my daughter loved!,0
There are lots of great shops around the hotel.,0
I would stay here again - particularly once the pool reopens ;)!,0
"It was a comfortable, spotlessly clean, well located hotel, great value for the price we paid (an online special summer rate).",0
"Got a deal on hotwire for two days:Great location, very good service, ok room.",0
"We had an appointment to which we were late,",0
"so it was wonderful for just drive up, have valet take car, bel-hop grab bags and be in room, with bags, in less than five minutes.",0
"Room is ok -not great,",0
bed was good.,0
"Location is close to all shopping,",0
Pike Place etc. We parked the car and walked/took bus/cab all around Seattle.,0
Also enjoyed fitness room and pool on top floor- Step-master while enjoying view of downtown with bay in distance...,0
I am very particular,0
and I was very happy with our choice to stay at the Sheraton.,0
Since I was working remotely,0
while my husband was attending a convention we upgraded to a club room with a desk.,0
This gave us access to a great continental breakfast and evening munchies.,0
"The staff was very friendly,",0
the beds were comfortable,0
and the room was very clean.,0
We walked all over town from here.,0
Avoid the double decker Gray Line tour.,1
"Dinner at the Space Needle as the sunset was a splurge, but well worth it.",0
"Wild Ginger, McCormick and Schmicks, Top pot donuts, and skating along the sound helped to make it a great working vacation.",0
I lived in Center City Philadelphia for 10 years and was still shocked by the number of homeless people in Seattle.,0
My husband was attending a conference at the hotel,0
and we chose to stay directly at the hotel for the latter part of the conference.,0
The first few days we spent at the Alexis which was absolutely gorgeous.,0
"Even though we booked directly through the Sheraton's website,",0
they were unable to accommodate us with a room in the newly refurbished section of the hotel unless we chose a room with only double beds.,0
"Although the room was good sized,",0
it was very drab.,0
"The bathroom was cramped compared to what the Alexis offered,",0
and the toiletries provided were way too perfumey.,0
"What can I say, a simple pleasure of mine is to enjoy the lotions, etc. that the hotel provides.",0
"On a positive note, the bed was very comfortable",0
and the heater noise was minimal.,0
The front desk staff was also very nice.,0
They nickel and dime you though.,0
$12/day including tax for internet?,0
Give me a break.,0
"I was spoiled by the room and amenities at the Alexis,",0
and that's the only place I'll stay next time.,0
"The room was large, nothing special about the bathroom,",0
the location was great!,0
"Lots of shopping around, places to eat, and close to Pike's Market.",0
The view from the room wasn't great.,0
The maid insisted on cleaning our room,0
while we were still in it.,0
The hotel was very empty,0
and we found out there were only 2 rooms occupied on our floor so it was very quiet!,0
Parking was quite expensive.,0
This place is a dump.,0
"The place was old and dirty, more like a 2 star hotel with dirty sheets and carpet.",0
"The place is right out of a bad seventies movie,",0
everything about it is old and worn.,0
I would avoid this place and wait till the new tower is build.,0
The location is ok but the hotel like a motel 6 at best.,0
We loved this hotel in downtown Seattle.,0
The location was great--close to Pikes Market and great shopping.,0
It was our first time in Seattle,0
and we couldn't have picked a better place to stay.,0
The room was spacious and spotless.,0
The bedding heavenly--we were on the club level,0
and we were pleasantly surprised at the great continental breakfast.,0
I would definitely recommend this hotel.,1
I used Priceline Name your own price and got a room for a 2 night stay for $101 a night.,0
When I got there it was about noon,0
and I had to wait until after 2:30 to check in,0
but they held our bags for us  we just went out and grabbed some lunch.,0
There was a little bit if a mix-up regarding my request for a king size bed,0
"but the management ended up upgrading me to a corner room (larger room, HDTV, king bed) and didn't charge us.",0
"We also asked to be put in the new tower, as recommended by other people here.",0
It was nice but we explored the older tower,0
and it was nice too.,0
My only complaint about the new tower is that the pool/spa/workout area is located on top of the OLD tower,0
and you have to go through the lobby to get to it.,0
If we knew that then we would of been happy to have a room in the old tower.,0
Free wifi in the lobby but you have to pay for it in the room.,0
A GREAT room safe!,0
I have a larger laptop,0
and this is the first hotel that it could be locked up with room to spare.,0
"The staff was professional and polite,",0
and they actually knew the answers to any questions I asked.,0
"The place was spotless, even with a convention going on.",0
We asked for robes,0
and they happily supplied 2 nice comfy ones...no charge.,0
My only minuses were the bed was a little hard (but still comfy) and the additional fees for the little things...which is typical of the hotels in Seattle anyway.,0
Parking was $35 a day,0
and in-room internet was $11 a day.,0
"Otherwise: nice size rooms, good security, friendly staff, clean, and the employees were professional and friendly.",0
If you are flying in I would suggest not renting a car as down Seattle can get crazy  parking is expensive.,1
This hotel was within walking distance to most attractions (the Space Needle has a monorail a couple of blocks away),0
and I would be happy to stay there again.,0
A cab from/to the airport is about $30. They have a generic shuttle that runs through a string of different hotels for $18 round trip pp.,0
The Hotel is in a great location.,0
Staying on the club floor we got an awesome continental breakfast.,0
The fruit selection was outstanding.,0
I dont know how people can say the Health Club was nice.,0
It is in need of a serious upgrade.,0
Treadmills were in very bad need of repair.,0
(all of them)...,0
The room was very small.,0
"If 8-10 people were in there, forget about working out.",0
The jacuzzi was hot and did not work well if at all.,0
The pool was average at best.,0
Rooms were nothing special.,0
The location (awesome) and the breakfast (awesome) raised this hotels grade to average to me.,0
There is no way I would pay anything over 200 a night to stay here.,0
There are many other quality hotels in all aspects for near that price.,0
We stayed at Hotel Andra for two nights.,0
The staff were very helpful throughout the stay.,0
The place is beautifully decorated,0
and the rooms were of average size.,0
I found the place to be quite clean.,0
The bed was wonderful.,0
"I usually have a terrible night's sleep in a hotel, but had a great sleep two nights in a row.",0
"I did not find the hotel to be noisy,",0
but my husband did.,0
I did find the hotel to be a bit over priced for what we got.,0
It is billed as being a small luxury hotel but really didn't see it as being any different other than decor.,0
The location was great - we walked everywhere from the hotel.,0
We only had breakfast at Lola (the adjoining restaurant),0
but it was excellent.,0
I had the doughnuts!!!,0
I'm still raving about them.,0
"Overall, I enjoyed our stay,",0
but next time would stay somewhere less expensive.,0
Clearly a luxury hotel but surprisingly ordinary.,0
Room modern but showing signs of wear  tear - not quality furnishings.,0
Good location for shops and the famous tourist sites.,0
"Just returned from a 6 night business trip to Seattle, and enjoyed staying at the Andra.",0
"This was my 3rd long stay at the hotel,",0
and each time I've been tempted to stay elsewhere in Seattle and have always ended up back at the Andra.,0
"This time my wife came with me and agreed it was a great hotel: we had a Queen Andra Suite with 2 double beds, large desk, flatscreen TV, walk in wardrobe, minibar and plenty of space.",0
The decor is in muted tones and interesting textures.,0
And the beds are amazingly comfortable: fine cotton sheets and soft down duvets and pillow made for a relaxing sleep.,0
The bar and lobby area is great for kicking back - quite small,0
but never had a problem getting in for late drinks.,0
"The best thing here is location too: on the edge of trendy Belltown with great restaurants in walking distance, and the shops a couple of blocks away.",0
"Lola onsite is good,",0
but the Dahlia Lounge directly opposite is fantastic.,0
Would definitely recommend the hotel: we stayed a couple of nights at the W Seattle,1
"and the two hotels are very similar in terms of service and room standards,",0
but the Andra is about half the price!,0
One thing: definitely try to get a high floored room away from the building works for the new skyscraper next floor.,1
"I have never had any problems,",0
but some of my colleagues have been near to the construction site,0
and they start very early!!,0
Experience @ A Great Rate Three cheers for the staff @ the Hotel Andra.,0
At all points of contact I felt welcomed  assisted in a professional but warm manner.,0
We were provided a complimentary upgrade on our room type (without our asking) when the front desk noted that they had room to do so.,0
Room service was fantastic (gourmet larger than life BLT sandwiches and delicious kebabs  dips).,0
"Big comfy robes, cool ambiance, and a blissful sleep.",0
The hotel is a bit older (like most in Seattle),0
but extremely clean and decor has been upgraded with a modern contemporary look/feel.,0
I'm confident that we couldn't have found a better boutique hotel for a better price.,0
A great experience - we will stay here again next time we travel down to Seattle for a getaway weekend!,0
"First of all, the location of the Andra can't be beat.",0
Walking to nearly every sight in Seattle was a breeze.,0
"However, I strain to compare this boutique hotel to the others I have visited on the west coast.",0
"The amenities were lackluster,",0
"the weightroom seemed like an afterthought,",0
and the staff was astoundingly incompetent and insincere.,0
"They seemed to know next to nothing about the property or the city,",0
and the management seemed to be hiding out in some alcove behind the desk.,0
"Overall, if you have money to burn and are looking for a staff to challenge your patience,",0
you will not be disappointed.,0
Wether that equals a happy stay because of the location is up to you.,0
My stay at the Andra was exceptional.,0
The location was terrific.,0
"Within walking distance of Pike Street, Needle, Jazz Clubs, Fine Restruants, and just plain city kicking around.",0
The rooms were clean and well maintained.,0
The staff was the best.,0
The beds were unreal.,0
If I didnt want to go out and see the city so much I would have just layed about in them all day they were that comfortable.,0
My wife and myself were so impressed that we have swore to return for a long weekend.,0
"For those who are taking a cruise out of Seattle , like us, plan an extra day or two prior to your leaving and stay at the Andra (about 3 minutes form the debarkation dock) to compliment your trip.",1
You will not be dissapointed.,0
What a great example of classic service.,0
Service was excellent.,0
I had set up a package via Luxury Link,0
however upon arrival the reservation was no where to be found.,0
The hotel staff was excellent in making it a non-issue.,0
Just returned from a 3 night stay.,0
This is a FABULOUS hotel.,0
"The front desk staff, the doormen, the breakfast staff, EVERYONE is incredibly friendly and helpful and warm and welcoming.",0
The room was fabulous too.,0
"Really comfy beds, great decorating, and super super clean.",0
"The breakfasts are great - fresh fruit, bagels, muffins, hot eggs and sausage, etc.",0
Good coffee.,0
Just around the corner from the hotel is a FABULOUS little Italian restaurant - Bon Amici.,0
Highly recommend it.,1
I will stay at this hotel everytime I come to New York.,0
"Comfortable, friendly hotel",0
My friend and I stayed at the Elan in late February.,0
Location was great.,0
"There were restaurants,Beverley Centre,laundrette, shops, all very close.",0
Public transport was very accessible.,0
The staff at the hotel were extremely helpful and courteous.,0
The rooms were quite nice and clean.,0
Bathrooms were good.,0
The free internet was a godsend.,0
The breakfast area next to the lobby was excellent with the morning sun beating in.,0
"The continental breakfast on offer was ideal with bagels ,cereals ,tea coffee, fresh fruit.",0
We had a very pleasant stay and I would highly recommend anyone to stay there.,1
Perfect hotel at a perfect location,0
My girlfriend and me stayed at the hotel Cadran over the wekend.,0
The room we had was perfect.,0
"It was newly renovated, clean and had a modern design.",0
Also the location of the hotel is perfect.,0
It is only a short walk away from the Eiffel tower.,0
NYC in the summer,0
Stayed here for an overnight while we were in town for a show.,0
"Hotel is good for a home base, but not real big ,no business center, etc,.",0
"Good location between Times Square and Central Park, Blue line station on 50th and 8th, walk to theaters, plus hot and cold breakfast with 2 staff members in the dining area.",0
"Rooms are standard, beds are new, staff in helpful.",0
They were selling broadway theater tix at the concierge desk.,0
"Call ahead, but I think that offered a different show each day.",0
"Good price ,$200, for a clean, safe, mid-town room ,2 double beds, that includes breakfast.",0
We stayed here for two nights on the recommendation of others on trip advisor.,0
We were very cautious because we were taking our two year old daughter and wanted to ensure that it was suitable.,0
"Well, it didnt let us down.",0
We stayed in a 1 bedroom lake view suit.,0
"It was clean, modern and spacious enough.",0
We were suprised by the 42 flat screen tv on the wall when we opened the door.,0
"There was some road noise at night, not from the main road directly below, but from the free-way behind, but this didnt spoil our much needed sleep.",0
"The pool was fine, clean and towels were available in the pool area.",0
"Like others before, i agree that the lift took ages to arrive at times, which was mildly frustrating.",0
The courtesy bus was excellent and always available. A great hotel,0
Loved this hotel,0
I disagree with some of the reviews i have read on tripadvisor re this hotel.,0
we stayed one night at the loews hotel miami beach where we have stayed many times and then moved to this hotel for 2 nights.,0
"From the time you walk in the door, this hotel makes you feel welcome.",0
the staff goes out of their way to make sure you are happy and comfortable.,0
Yes the pool is small but the last thing i want to do at a hotel is sit around a pool with a lot of people.,0
the beach was magnificent.,0
Have recently returned from a four night stay in the lenox a great experience.,0
"Firstly location is perfect close to Boston Common and handy for trains , harvard trip a must, and short taxi rides to anywhere else you want to visit.",0
The rooms were well appointed and roomy enough bathrooms were fine.,0
There are two bars an Irish bar a little more casual and the city bar very busy and a little more highbrow.,0
Overall if you stay at the lenox you will not be disappointed,0
Lovely Hotel Cannot speak highly enough of The London Bridge Hotel.,0
"Our room was delightful, the service was brilliant and the breakfast was superb.",0
Stayed for three nights in July and wished it was longer,0
Thanks to all staff.,0
"Beautiful Stay Wonderful hotel, excellent location",0
"You are in walking distance ,minutes, to Bourbon Street, Canal Street, and the French Market.",0
"The rooms were beautiful, not large, but definitely enough room for two.",0
"The hotel has completed $70 million in renovations, and it shows.",0
The bathroom was decorated with marble tile and granite countertop.,0
The shower was great- lots of pressure and no temperature fluctuations.,0
The hotel bar is unique with a revolving central carousel.,0
The Hunt Grill was wonderful- try the crab bisque and crab cakes.,0
"They left an offer in our room for a free bottle of wine with 2 entrees in the restaurant, which was a nice touch.",0
We would definitely return to this hotel,0
"ugly inside, nice outside ,nice location, aaaaahh",0
very ugly room.,0
but it has a very nice location.,0
Great Stay in Downtown Miami,0
We chose the Mandarin Oriental as we felt to old for South Beach and we were glad we made the right choice.,0
The hotel is lovely - all rooms have balconies and we chose the Executive Suite - lots of space and a lovely bathroom.,0
A cab to SoBe was $30 and if youre staying at the M.O. then this is a small price to pay.,0
"The service was very good, prices for meals and drinks expensive as you would expect - no point in whinging about a $12 martini if your paying hundreds for the room.",0
"For those of us visitors without cars, taxis were easy to get and there is a new complex called Mary Brickell Village which has some good restaurants and is a 10 minute walk away.",0
"The in-room facilities have it all, although no flat screen TVs yet.",0
"The amenities are Aromatherapy Associates of London - smell of lavender and rose - delightful, conditioner is great.",0
Load of fresh fluffy towels.,0
"Pool is a bit small but adequate, the gym well equipped but not used much.",0
Azul was a fantastic meal - delicious contempory food and slick service but the only detractor was that it arrived on a cold plate.,0
The only other detractor was the bar - off to one side of reception and seemed like a last minute thought - slick service and a list of over 200 martini - we were sorry we didnt stay long enough to try them all.,0
"We had booked one of the red rooms, but on arrival were informed that one of the suites was available in an adjacent building down a short Calle.",0
"Once we had seen the picture, we were hooked and when we saw it, we knew we had made the right choice.",0
"It was lovely, and looked very recently done.",0
"There was a king size fourposter bed,draped in white muslin.",0
"Dressing table, and wardrobe all beautifully decorated.",0
"The walls are covered in cream striped fabric, and there are very beautiful wall lights and table lamps.",0
The windows were dressed with acres more white muslin and luxuriously draped curtains.,0
"The room was equipped with a security box in the wardrobe and a very efficient mini bar, not to mention the wall mounted flat screen TV.The bathroom was spotlessly clean, and equipped with a superb shower cubicle.",0
"Everything from spare toothbrushes, razors , shower caps, shoe polishing sponges and a very handy sewing kit.",0
"The double glazing kept out all noise, and the shutters were excellent too.",0
"It was hard to believe that you were only a couple of hundred yards away from the Grand Canal, you heard nothing, not even the church bells",0
"The entry hall was all marble, as were the two flights of stairs you had to climb to get to our suite.",0
"Entry was via a buzzer system operated from the reception area, then a security card key to your suite.",0
We were never kept waiting to get in form more than a minute.,0
"The hotel has tables and chairs right on the Grand Canal, and a shady area to the side under two large sun shades.",0
We sat there for a couple of hours every afternoon with a drink or two just watching Venice pass by.,0
"Entertainment was provided by the Gondoliers based at the Gondola station right outside the notel, their banter is wonderful to watch.",0
"Breakfast was very good, cheese and cold meats, boiled eggs yoghurts, cereals, juice and a wide array of pastries and fresh fruit.",0
"We got down later one morning, nearer 10 than 7, and there was still plenty to choose from.",0
Fresh coffee is made for you from an impressive machine at reception.,0
A choice of teas was also available.,0
"The breakfast room was very well presented, and you can also breakfast outside or in the bar area.",0
We did all three during our stay.,0
The reception staff and all the waiting/bar staff were extremely helpful and friendly.,0
Nothing was too much trouble.,0
"Reception was full of flowers, and an enduring memory of the hotel will be the scent of lilies, gorgeous",0
"We will definately be returning, and recommending it to anyone we know is intending to visit Venice.",1
"Almost forgot, it is even easier to find it when you arrive at Piazza Roma than the website says, and takes less than 10 minutes to walk even with a case.",1
"They were also more than happy to store our luggage before and after check out, which was brilliantEverything is right there on the doorstep.",0
You cannot go wrong.,0
"We were asked when we left if we could think of anyway the stay could have been better, we honestyly couldnt hink of anything at all.",0
"On reflection, a chest of drawers might be a useful addition to Room 515, but in the scale of things, how minor is that?",0
"Pretty much faultless, we loved it.",0
"Had booked this hotel for a 10-night stay ,got a great deal via",0
"HotelConnect, mainly based on the many great reviews here.",0
And it fully lived up to our expectations,0
"Check-in a bit late - but it was a busy time for the hotel, and theres plenty to do just on the doorstep, so that was okay",0
"Great location - plenty to see, and good train/tube connections.",0
Charing Cross only 10 mins by train.,0
Even Portobello - which is in the direct opposite of London - only took less than _?��_��__��_��___ hour by tube.,0
"Staff was friendly and hard-working - yes, many are from other European countries, but all work hard and are very friendly, so I cant see why some reviewers ,and even some hotel-guests we overheard, would mention it as if it was a negative",0
"Beds comfy, room spotless, good sanitary appliances as opposed to usual British plumbing",0
"Breakfast was typical hotel fare, not especially exciting, but fresh, varied and plentiful.",0
"Room-service fast and delicious, great selection of food.",0
Ate dinner at Georgetown - highly recommended,1
Great value in Seattle,0
Myself and spouse stayed at the Warwick Seattle for four days in September.,0
This hotel does not disappoint as a reasonably priced stay in the downtown area.,0
"Its an easy walk to all sightseeing attractions ,five blocks from the waterfront, and there is a free bus in Seattle but we could never figure out how that worked ,do some research before you go,.",0
"Our room ,king bed, was spacious and nicely appointed, very comfortable and with plenty of pillows.",0
"The coffee in the room of course was great ,this being Seattle,.",0
The bath is finished in marble with a deep tub and hand-held shower which was a nice touch.,0
Toiletries were below average but thats not a huge consideration for us.,0
Our only complaints concerned the front desk.,0
"I had made two reservations: one for the first part of our trip and one for the third leg ,after Olympic Penninsula, but decided to cancel the second reservation.",0
When we arrived at the hotel after a full day of travel the desk clerk kept us waiting for several minutes without so much as a hello.,0
We moved to the second desk clerk when she was free and were told that our reservation could not be found.,0
No attempt was made to look for it.,0
We had to walk up the stairs to the parking garage and get our confirmation from our luggage and only then did they find the reservation.,0
The following day my office tried to call and was told that we werent staying there.,0
Parking is $21/day which is pretty steep but the only option because parking in Seattle is scarce.,0
"The hotel doesnt have a shuttle so the only other option was a cab which is about $30.The hotel restaurant is adequate but for a really great breakfast walk a block to the Mayflower Park Hotel ,pricey but fabulous,.",0
"Good position, nice staff and very clean rooms ",0
The bathroom is also very nice and quite big.,0
"other services are available : travel agency, security boxes in the reception, internet for 10 pesos per 15 minutes and the reception can keep your luggages if you are away for your last day...",0
Well so much good had been said about this hotel I knew we would be happy staying here.,0
"It was easy to find, parking for free is a bonus and boy oh boy was Versa a wealth of information",0
"She was always smiling, and ready with any questions.",0
"We booked the city tour thru her ,she did all the calling, and she helped us reserve tickets for Alcatraz.",0
"The location is perfect, right in the middle of the city, easy to walk anywhere, or hop on transit.",0
"And we did, we saw so much",0
"The positives on the room are that is was a large room, king bed was nice, it was also very clean.",0
"Negatives, sheets had small holes or even areas where it was torn.",0
Towels were small and very rough.,0
"Very thin walls and floors, could hear your neighbours all around.",0
Furniture was old and shows the wear and tear.,0
Water in the shower went from cold to hot and back again.,0
All in all it was adequate for what we needed.,0
The price was certainly good.,0
"But I dont think I would stay here again, I may need to pay more and get more.",0
Inexpensive Boutique-like Hotel,0
"If you dont mind a 20 minute train ride to get into the city, this is the place to stay in Amsterdam.",1
I booked this hotel for less than $100 USD and it is one of the best values that I have ever received from a hotel.,0
"The check-in is amazingly quick and can be done without talking to anyone, if you choose.",0
"The computer guides you through the system; however, two guest service personnel stand by for your convenience.",0
The lobby is beautiful.,0
"The room is small ,the width of the room is the length of a kingsized bed,, but it is so well laid out, you would hardly notice the size.",0
The pod toilet is private enough that you dont feel awkward about utilizing the facility with another person in the room.,0
The TV and the room remote control is awesome.,0
"Now, the only negative about this room...the shower.",0
"Since the pod shower only works when it is closed, it is not possible to get warm water flowing before you step into the pod.",0
This burst of cold water from the roof of the shower is quite the wake-up.,0
The check-out from the room is just as easy as the check-in.,0
The hotel is immediately adjacent to the airport and it is perfect for early morning departures,0
"Also, I will seriously consider this as my base hotel for visiting Amsterdam in the future, despite the fact that it is a brief train ride from the center of town.",0
"Note, the room can only accommodate two people who are close",0
"Meaning, dont expect your family of four to be comfortable in one room.",1
Cant fault it...,0
"I am lucky enough to travel to Tokyo quite a lot and I always stay at the Okura ,South Wing,.",0
"Colleagues ask me why when I can stay at one of the massive chain hotels, also on the approved list.",0
"The answer is pretty simple - you just cannot fault the Okura for price, location and for comfort.A previous reviewer commented on the decor seeming old fashioned.",0
Its like stepping into my nans living room with brown and orange geometric patterned carpets and 70s furniture.,0
"Its not true to say that it hasnt been renovated, though.",0
Part of the beauty of the Okura is that they *do* renovate it every few years - they just keep it the same way and I kind of like that.,0
"The big chains and their attempt to instill some americana into Japan result in a dilution of the excellent Japanese service ethic, which as visitors will know, is out of this world, but very rule-bound.",0
"Top tip for frequent visitors is the Okura Club International which you can join for nothing and entitles bearers to free usage of the pool, showers and o-furo ,bath, which you would normally have to pay for.",1
"Even if this is an urban myth, I dont care.",0
"I really cant imagine John and Yoko sitting amongst the crap Scottish memorabilia, but I hope its true.I have only ever eaten at the Chinese restaurant in the Okura - To Ka Lin - and it is exquisite.",0
"Expensive though, but it is supposedly the best Chinese restaurant in Japan.",0
Not sure about that - take a trip to Yokohamas Chinatown - but it is very good if youre feeling lazy and cant be bothered to venture out of the hotel.,0
"If youre heading to Tokyo, whether its business or pleasure, I definitely recommend the Okura. 70s kitsch, crap Scottish bar - its all good.",1
Nice boutique hotel in a fabulous city,0
working on fulfilling my New Year resolution to be more diligent about writing hotel reviews on tripadvisorWe stayed at this hotel for 3 nights in December 2006.,0
Overall Hotel California offers a fantastic value.,0
"The two things that really did it for me were the beds ,very comfortable and we loved the flannel sheets,",0
and the free internet with printer on the mezzanine.,0
Our room was not large but nicely decorated and very sunny with a good sized bay window looking out onto Geary Street.,0
"I did not notice traffic sounds during our stay, but I also sleep like the dead so it no surprise.",0
"The room had wood floors so I halfway expected my socks to pick up dust and whatnot walking around, but the floor was spotless- as was the entire room.",0
The staff members were generally very helpful and pleasant.,0
Several times they assisted us with public transportation schedules and attraction information.,0
"None of them appeared to be a concierge per se and noone offered to make us dinner reservations when asked about restaurants, so expect to take care of these details on your own.",1
"We love boutique hotels with eclectic features, so this was a good fit for us.",0
If you prefer large corporate-style hotels this may not be the place for you.,1
"Next time we are in San Fran we will likely stay at the Westin, but as a more economical alternative only 2 blocks down, this place is great",0
"Honestly, this may be one of the best values in San Fran, a place that defies the meaning of value.",0
We were only disappointed we couldnt stay longer in this great city.,0
"Friendly staff, great location",0
My husband and I stayed at the Park Hotel and enjoyed our time in Amsterdam.,0
The hotel is in a great location,0
"The staff was so friendly and helpful, and our room was above average, considering the norm for hotels in Europe.",0
"The prices were high, but the location cant be beat.",0
Knew the seminyak area well but hads never stayed at the Sofitel before.,0
"was slightly cautious after reviews on here but was more than happy with what we ended up with - room was fine, perfectly large enough for European tastes.",0
"Did have the same problem with aircon but it was stuck on 23C not 25, so not such a problem.",0
"breakfast fantastic, as everyone has said before, and ate drank around the pool most days - certainly no complaints, and given the decent GBP/USD rate no complaints re prices.",0
food also of a very good standard.,0
"I would agree that sometimes the standard isnt great all the time, but they do at least make the effort, which is half the point in my opinion.",0
"For what we paid I have nothing to complain about, and will happily return.",0
Just got back from a wonderful 4 day trip to NYC and had such a greatl experience staying at the Chelsea Lodge.,0
"We went fully aware that the rooms were small, and yes they were, but spotless and charming.",0
It is called a LODGE...and thats exactly what it felt like.,0
Staff was very nice and welcoming.,0
Shared toilets are not a problem at all.,0
Great air conditioning...and we needed it as it was very hot.,0
Located on a very safe street in Chelsea...steps away from many restaurants and cafes.,0
For great morning coffee and pastries try La Bergamote on 9th Ave at 20th.,0
The Lasagna Ristorante on 8th is very good as well.,0
Staying at the Chelsea Lodge makes u feel as if you are living there and not just a visitor to a typical sterile hotel room.,0
Could go on for days about how pleased we were.,0
Such a great find....we will DEFINITELY be back.,0
An experience of a lifetime,0
"Greater: Lizandro Rodriguez, was very friendly and curteous the whole week I was there.",0
He made sure I was happy.,0
When I arrived to the hotel I was very sick and he send medicine to my room as well as room service.,0
Thanks to him I was able to enjoy my stay.,0
Im planing my next vacation for next year.,0
Vacation From Hell,0
"Thier brochure and website rate this hotel as a four and half star property, but at the time of our visit it did not meet the standard of a three star property.",0
"At the time of our visit, the buffet, beach club and several restaurants were under renovation.",0
"Our decision on this property was made based on the information in the Air Transat Holidays brochure and the Occidental Gran Flamenco website, neither of which mentioned any renovations.",0
The renovations to the buffet resulted in the buffet being served in the stage area and theGrill Restaurant.,0
There was not enough seating for the number or guests and because the buffet was divided into two sections; it was necessary to go to both lines to obtain a complete meal.,0
"The result was if you ate at the buffet, you had to wait for a table and stand in two lines to obtain your meal.",0
Not once during our stay were we able to enjoy a hot meal from the buffet.,0
"We had to eat at dirty tables, surrounded by dirty dishes to consume lukewarm or cold meals.",0
It was very difficult to obtain a reservation to dine at the a la carte restaurants.,0
The reservation system allowed only you to reserve for the current day or the day following.,0
There was so much demand that all spots available were filled before 9:00am.,0
"During our stay, we were able to obtain reservations for only two dinners.",0
"For our meal at The Grill restaurant, my husband was served tenderloin of beef that was rancid.",0
The staff at the restaurant were unapologetic and made no effort satisfy the problem.,0
"We reported this incident immediately to guest services at the hotel, but there was no further response from the hotel.",0
"It was at this time we tried to contact the Air Transat Holidays representative for Punta Cana, she did not answer at the number we had been given at any time between 7:30 to10:00 pm.",0
We left a detailed message the following morning but received no response that day and the following day was her day off.,0
"If we had been able to contact her, we would have requested a change in accommodation.",0
"Since we were not able to do so we remained at the Flamenco, where the next morning a note under our door informed us that more renovations were planned which interfered with the operation of the both the Mexican and the Italian restaurant.",0
That made all their restaurants under some degree of renovation with no clear plan on how to provide food services to their guests.,0
"In addition to the problem with food services at the Flamenco, we had one complete day with no running water in our room and the service at the beach left much to be desired.",0
"Often we were not able to obtain beach towels, some days the wait was an hour, on others days the staff had no idea when more towels were coming.",0
We had to keep our dirty towels or go without.,0
"The brochure advertises that windsurfing, kayaking, and sailing are included.",0
"During our stay, despite many requests we were never able to persuade the staff to put a sailboat in the water.",0
The constant explanation was that it was either too windy or too wavy.,0
The resorts on either side of us must have completely different weather as their sailboats and kayaks were constantly in the water.,0
The beach staff at the Flamenco were interested only in selling us the motorized sports that were not included in our package.,0
"If we had been informed about the renovations at the Gran Flamenco when we were making our reservation, we would have chosen a different property.",0
I spoke directly with Air Transat reservations to assist in choosing a property because this was our first visit to the Dominican.,0
The other services we received from Air Transat for this vacation were exceptional; the staff at the Vancouver airport was helpful and polite.,0
The flight crew on our flights were wonderful.,0
The transfers worked smoothly and our accommodation in Vancouver was just as advertised.,0
"However, what should have been the best part of our vacation the time in Punta Cana fell far short of our expectations, because of the inferior food service and inadequate service at the beach.",0
"I am sure that our complaint is not the only one they will receive about the problems at the Gran Flamenco, Punta Cana as there were many unsatisfied guests there.",0
Neither the staff of the hotel or your representative in Punta Cana showed any interest in resolving any of the problems we encountered; we certainly hope that this is not indicative of your company policy.,0
The problems at the hotel resulted in our having a vacation from hell instead of a vacation in paradise.,0
The complaints we have expressed in this letter are a brief overview and do not constitute a comprehensive list of the problems we encountered at the hotel.,0
"If you wish to hear more details, please contact us and we will be glad to provide them.",0
Loved it all,0
Stayed here between 13th Oct and 17th Oct.,0
"After travelling for 16 days across the USA, ie, Anaheim,Las Vegas New York, we were ready for some rest and relaxation and that is what we got.",0
The room was great with partial ocean views and city views even though wed only paid for city views.,0
"Big enough and confortable for my husband, daughter and me.",0
Right across from the International Market Place and close to any shop or bus stop or anything you wanted.,0
"Dukes was fantastic, we had breakfast there every morning and also dinner once.",0
The staff were excellent- very friendly even during and after the earthquake.,0
"Cant commend the staff highly enough including the General Manager Greg, during this difficult time.",0
"We were all fed free of charge, breakfast, lunch and dinner and everyone had smiles on their faces.",0
"They were even baking cookies and making popcorn at 8.30 pm, when we still had no electricity.",0
Good location - average rooms - Great Exec Lounge,0
We stayed with our daughters at this downtown Hilton property for three night over the holiday weekend.,0
"We had a nice view of the bay, although some buildings got in the way.",0
"The front desk staff was very polite and helpful with me, but I did see them treat some older guests with a little disrespect.",0
Parking was a joke at $26.00 per nite.,0
"On the positive side - the Executive Lounge, although a little cramped, offered free drinks and appetizers everynight from 5 - 9pm and the Exec Concierge was very helpful.",0
He put together a dinner at Saltys that included a complimentary limo ride to and from the Hilton - a big win for the kids.,0
"I would stay here again on points of for business, but if it was my own money I might look around before booking it.",1
"Its location is perfect, overlooking a beautiful cathedral, the national palace, the ruins of the Aztec pyramids, and one of the largest squares in the world.",0
More historical and cultural sites are within walking distance than we could possibly see in our 5 day stay.,0
"We arrived in the evening and had dinner on the terrace at the hotel restaurant, looking out over the historical center and the twinkling city lights.",0
A breathtaking view by any standard.,0
"As late June is in the rainy season, the air was quite clean.",0
"The hotels breakfast buffet is bountiful and delicious, and the prices reasonable.",0
"Our room was small, but very clean and had a nice high ceiling and a safe.",0
"By international standards, the price of the room was very reasonable.",0
"We recommend visiting the excavation of the Aztec pyramids next to the national cathedral, about a five minute walk from the hotel.",1
"Also, the food at the nearby Cafe de Tacuba is excellent.",0
"For visiting sites in other areas of the city ,we loved visiting Frido Kahlos Blue House in Coyoacan,, the hotel will arrange for taxi service.",0
"The driver can take you from place to place, for a reasonable price.",1
This is much safer and far more convenient than hailing taxis from the street.,1
Check in on a Thursday evening was rapid we chose this hotel on kowloon side as we were there for business.,0
This hotel was The Business.,0
Staff Immediate upgrade to larger triple with excellent views.,0
"Reception staff were first class, concierge service was equally as gracious with an ambundance of local knowledge from advice as to where to get a good pint to the best place for toys, complete with a beware the quality reminder.",0
I did require a doctor whilst there as I had forgot to pack some cruical medication that was available on prescription only.,0
The duty manager spoke to me in person and advised me to go to my room whilst he sorted this out within 5 minutes I was on the phone to the hotels sub contracted doctor who advised me to travel to see him as it would be quicker and cheaper.,0
"From pressing the lift buttons for you to helping you in and out of taxis, to there genuine pleasure in serving you.",0
"This was a refreshing change and something staff at the supposed super resorts in Dubai ,I have Madinat Jumeirah in Mind, should take note of.",0
"Truly truly gob smacking pioneering customer service with little touches everywhere, amazing gracious service.",0
"The room, all mod cons, plasma, dvd, stereo, wireless keyboard for the internet ,chargeable,, quiet and reliable air con, nice window seat built into the ledge, reasonable min bar prices, pillow menu, slippers, gown etc.",0
"The rooms are fresh, crisp, well maintained, bathrooms are spacious enough and the open bathroom is easily rectified by simply drawing the blinds.",0
"Restaurants and bars Very good from bar snacks, to the chinese ,Ming Court I think?,",0
In restaurant the food quality is good.,0
You are safe and there are more than enough shops in the immediate locality for you to have a browse around.,0
There is a shortage of good local bars however but dont worry.,0
Its only 60-80 HKD to the Wan Chai bars and central.,0
Again same price to the Mall at Harbour city which is a good one in my opinion.,0
You can also use the MTR which is 4 mins from the hotel.,1
"Clean, fast and efficient a pleasure to use, journey time into central/ causeway bay 10 mins max.",0
"You can also use the star ferry, pennies, on the Kowloon side which will drop you island side adjacent to harbour city mall which is a good spot to take the classic harbour panoramic photo.",1
I have no qualms about staying Kowloon side the hotels tend to be cheaper.,0
OverallIve been a very lazy trip advisor for years.,0
"I should have posted reviews about the Atlantis Bahamas, Loewes Miami beach, Mina A Salam Dubai, Westin Times Square New York, numerous eastern shangri las.",0
The hotel and its staff are excellent go and enjoy a fantastic city hotel.,0
"Flights Virgin ,Direct booking, Truly Rubbish service both ways and I like Virgin.",0
I just got back from staying at Hotel Vintage Park and their staff is excellent.,0
We were celebrating our 1st yr anniversary and the hotel upgraded our room to a King Premiere and gave us a complimentary bottle of champagne.,0
"The hotel is located in a pretty good location, in the shopping district and about a 1/2 mile walk to Pikes Market.",0
The hotel itself is small and older but the staff makes up for it.,0
Heart of HollywoodO,0
"It is in a great location for the Hollywood area, it is right next to a subway stop, but to get around in Los Angeles you will need a car.",1
The room was comfortable with a great view of Los Angeles.,0
We were placed next to the service elevator and the walls were on the thin side.,0
"So, be sure to tell them in advance if noise bothers you.",1
The bed was comfortable.,0
The food was expensive in the hotel.,0
"Though, there are a significant number of places to eat within walking distance.",0
The lobby is somewhat chic and the neighborhood is a very typical Hollywood neighbor hood.,0
The lobby is very small and looks newly refitted.,0
The rooms are clean and modern we were on the top floor in a room overlooking the pool so we had a good view of the hills and had no noise problems.,0
The resturant serves a good buffet breakfast for around $12 which is well worth it.,0
There is a Subway Starbucks store over the road which is very handy.,0
Just Fantastic I stayed there for 3 nights on my,0
Easter holidays and all I can say is that the place was great.,0
The room was small but not tiny.,0
The bed was very comfortable and everything was kept really clean.,0
The bathroom was small but perfect with a powerful shower.,0
"All the tiles had been changed recently and the walls painted ,it still smelt of paint,.",0
My room was number 9 and was really quiet.,0
"Breakfast was very good, you could choose between coffee or tea, orange juice or cereal, fried egg, grilled bacon and baked beens, two boiled eggs or ham and tomato, and also they gave you toast with butter, jam and marmalade.",0
"The staff was kind and helpful, always smily.",0
"The location was just perfect, very close to Victoria Station in a very nice and quiet neighbourhood.",0
"Bus n24 stops opposite the hotel and goes to Westminster, the Parliament, Trafalgar Square, Leicester Square, Tottenham Court ,British Museum,, Camden Town........Absolutely convenient.",0
"There were underground stations five minutes away ,Victoria and Pimlico, but the bus was better and not so crowded.",0
There were also plenty of restaurants and pubs nearby.,0
"I can recommend a Turkish restaurant in Wilton Road called Mezze ,but book in advance if you want to have dinner there as its quite busy,.",1
There was a Sainsburys supermarket close to the hotel and also a Tesco.I will definitely stay there again,0
My husband and I stayed here for a quick weekend trip and besides the location were not all that impressed.,0
"The cava at reception is a nice touch though we had to ask for a glass ,?,",0
We were in Gravina II which I think might be a newer section on the 5th floor.,0
"Because we were traveling with a small child we needed to use the elevator which barely held myself and a child, but you still had to go up stairs to get to the elevator to Gravina II.",0
"THE MOVING FURNITURE SOUND UNCOVERED, it is the ceiling mounted radio speaker",0
For some reason the radio can be controlled on the headboard of the bed and the speaker is mounted in the ceiling.,0
"Cool I guess, but the problem is even on volume as low as it will go it comes on supper supper loud with this Errerrrt sound, and you quickly turn it back off.",0
Once we did it we started noticing others doing the same thing which does sound like furniture moving.,0
The room initially looked good until closer inspection showed molding coming unglued and loose caulking in the shower.,0
Not that big of a deal but maybe spend the $$ fixing these instead of a celing mounted radio that is useless,0
We were lucky enough not to get the two twin beds pushed together although this was the hardest bed I have slept on.,0
Take a left when you exit the hotel and there is a wonderful bakery down the next street open early for freash breakfast.,0
WAYYY better than my runny eggs and 4EUro Coke at the hotel.,0
On the other hand the staff was very friendly and honest.,0
"Im not saying this isnt a good hotel for the price and location, but I would look around before I would stay here again.",0
Great Location and really clean,0
Myslef and 10 friends stayed here for 5 nights over the first weekend in December.,0
The Courtyard is very clean and is in a great location only 10 mins from Macys/Newbury Street.,0
I would definitely stay there again.,0
"However, just a couple of small things - one of our triple rooms was really small, only fit as a double and there was no mirror in the bedroom at all, just the bathroom mirror so it was a bit of hassle when 3 women were getting ready to go out.",0
"So if you are checking in and they allocate room 1238, make sure you have your own mirror.",1
"Overall a great stay and the shopping was brill, much better than NY.",0
Kind and Considerate,0
We booked this hotel after reading several reviews as it seemed like the best deal when we compared the rates to the downtown hotels.,0
Most of the reviews stated that the staff was very helpful and friendly.,0
We found this to be the case in a very special way.,0
We were to attend the Mariners game on Saturday night and were running late as we were coming in from Eugene.,0
We were unable to stop at the hotel before the game.,0
We came out from the game and our rentals window had been broken and everything we owned was stolen.,0
We called Jeff at the hotel to tell him we would be late and to be sure and hold the room.,0
We finally arrived around 2 AM as the police never came to the scene.,0
Jeff helped us to get the basic necessities and was on the lookout for the police who finally arrived around 3.,0
"The rest of the staff was very helpful the remaining days of our stay, but we can never thank Jeff enough for his support that evening.",0
The room was very nice and clean.,0
The University Inn is a very good deal that I would recommend to our friends.,1
Watch out where you park in Seattle.,1
The night we returned our rental two gentlemen in a Lincoln suffered the same fate.,0
Stay elsewhere if at all possible.,1
"Situated in a section of Madrid east of the Retiro park, you could be anywhere where high rise buildings predominate.",0
No atmosphere.,0
Inconvenient to everything.,0
Everything in hotel done on the cheap.,0
Staff disorganized and surly.,0
Even refused to call for taxis.,0
Breakfast lackluster.,0
See my review of Senator Gran Via where I stayed the preceding week.,0
Well placed hotel,0
Booked this hotel because of reviews in Trip Advisor.,0
"It is very well placed for central Paris - 10 minutes walk to Eiffel Tower, Pont dAlma.",0
Well served by buses and a metro station less than 5 minutes walk away.,0
Plenty of eating places with varied prices all around.,0
We had a room with double and single bed and it was a reasonable size.,0
Shower area was small though and door didnt fit so the floor got wet,0
I liked that wine and soft drinks were available with honesty payments and a fridge to store your own purchases but felt it was a lack that there was no coffee or tea-making facilities either in room or in area where could have lunch.,0
"It was good to have that area, but there wasnt anywhere really comfortable to sit either in eating area or your room.",0
The TV was really high up and awkward to see.,0
Beautiful resort Just got back last night from a one week stay at the Sirenis Cocotal.,0
I went with my 15 year old daughter and a friend of mine.,0
We were very impressed with the facilities and the people.,0
The food was plentiful and very tasty.,0
None of us were sick and as far as I know no one else at the resortl was ill.,0
The mosquitos were not a problem either.,0
There is something for everyone there.,0
We rented a couple of four wheeled dirt bikes and rode up the hillside and through a village.,0
It was wonderful.,0
Very fun and nice to see the countryside.,0
My daughter fell in love with the staff at the resort.,0
"The animation ,entertainment, crew were terrific.",0
Very energetic and funny.,0
We will definetely go back.,0
It is a wonderful hotel in a perfect location to explore Boston.,0
The rooms are spacious and the bed and duvet were very comfortable.,0
The service was second to none.....if you cant be pleased here than you cant be pleased anywhere.,0
"As expected Typical of this sort of hotel with rooms fitted and finished to a high standard, polite and attentive staff, good food, smart and spacious communal areas although these are beginning to look slightly dated now.",0
Location was not ideal although in any big city no location is ideal for everywhere anyway.,0
Basically everything we would have expected from a hotel under this brand.,0
Good hotel We booked our hotel and flight to,0
Barcelona over the net.,0
"The flight went to Girona, so we got the bus to the station and you could see the hotel from the entrance, only 2 mins walk.",0
Check in was fine.,0
The hotel looked very new.,0
"Our room was on the 4th floor, facing the street, we could open the window and look out.",0
"Very nice furnishings, free mini bar, the beer was awful but we enjoyed the water, juice and coke.",0
"The bathroom was very nice, the bath was really big to lie in.",0
"We walked to the Sagrada , the Ramblas and beach from the hotel and we also used the metro.",0
The 2 ladies on reception were very helpful and kind to us.,0
"The internet was free but I do think people should only be allowed say 30 mins and its written in a book, thats a fair way I think.",0
"We tried the bakery across the road, had cold pizza and cake, very nice.",0
We would definetely stay at this hotel again.,0
Absolutely fantastic,0
Stayed here for a hen trip with 3 of my girlfriends for 3 nights.,0
We only booked 1 room which was fine as the beds were huge as was the room/suite.,0
Staff are friendly and very helpful.,0
"Hotel location is excellent - walking distance from Bloomingdales, Central Park and subway stations.",0
Good central hotel.,0
I have stayed in this hotel twice.,0
It is perhaps a bit old fashioned but very comfortable.,0
The rooms were very well furnished but the bathroom in one of them was poor for a 4star hotel.,0
The location is superb and having a tram stop 20metres away is a real bonus.,0
Pretty Nice,0
I stayed here seven nights while attending a conference at the convention center.,0
"The room was a bit smaller than the typical hotel room, but it was clean and looked well kept.",0
"The hallways smelled a little funky, but tolerable.",0
"The first floor ,lobby, restaurant, shops, were all nicely decorated and clean.",0
The staff was very welcoming and helpful.,0
"My view ,20th floor, looked west to north and was pretty nice.",0
"Knowing the area, I knew I wasnt going to have too much of an ocean view.",0
Location in downtown Waikiki cant be beat.,0
Youre right across the street from Dukes bar and the Mai Tai bar at the Royal Hawaiian,0
"Easy walk to the beach and the aquarium ,highly recommend.",1
"The hike to the convention center is not horrible, but longer than I anticipated, especially in long pants at 2:00 in the afternoon.",0
A nice place and I would probably stay there again.,0
They lost my reservation,0
I was attracted to Hotel Fita by its location and offer of free internet and long-distance telephone.,0
I contacted them via their web site and reserved about six weeks in advance.,0
"When I arrived in Amsterdam, I went to the hotel and was told that they had no reservation for me, were not expecting me, and that they were full for the night.",0
"In the end, they helped me find another room for one night nearby ,at perhaps the worst hotel Ive stayed at in twenty years, and then gave me a room upgrade for the remaining night.",0
"Aside from my dealings with the owner ,who was less than hospitable and crossed out my entry in their guest book,, the staff were great and the hotel was clean and modern.",0
"Good enough, but not that great.",0
"Yes, we liked it,too.",0
After many years it was wonderful to come back to Boston.,0
We enjoyed this hotel and its location very much.,0
"As lots of others have said already, all stuff is great and helpful.",0
The concierge Charles went out of his way to help us with tickets.,0
The lobby was a little small and got crowded one monrning whena larger group of people arrived.,0
Our room was spacious and the bed very comfy.,0
"There was only one problem which was a little let down:there was a connecting door to the room next to us and at around 4 oclock in the morning people were talking so loud, that we could not sleep any longer.",0
It happend again once more at about the same time.,0
San Gallo was a pleasant surprise in Florence.,0
"We were given room 205 with a huge balcony over the main entrance of the hotel, huge bedroom and living room for the same price we paid for a small room in Rome.",0
"This hotel was very clean, large bathroom and the closet space was great too.",0
Two welcome drinks at their bar.,0
"Breakfast rooms were inside or outside: cereal; scrambled eggs, bacon, cheese, ham, breads, pastries, yogurt, fruit, jams, bottled water and good coffee.",0
Hotel faces Piazza della Liberta.,0
Bus #1 from the train station is most direct but #25 and #33 will get you there also.,1
"This hotel is on the other side of the Piazza from the bus stop ,caddy corner to the large statue at the archway of the Piazza,.",0
I would stay here again.,0
"There is a wine bar called Nabucca on Via XXVII April, which had a nice spread of appetizers, complimentary with drinks.",0
They had a great wine selection from all over Italy.,0
"Not a far walk to the Duomo, farther walk to Ufizzi but manageable if you like to walk.",0
"All roads lead to the Duomo, it is hard to escape its gravity.",0
Have fun and stay at the San Gallo Palace.,0
"had to bust open windows after room was cleaned, too far and ugly to walk to Chinatown or North Beach ,they suggest that you walk through this filthy long tunnel to get there and if you dont its longer ,and just as un-scenic,, super noisy",0
"walls are made of paper,",0
"stomping people above us, loud car and nightclub noise outside, etc., etc.,continental breakfast served from 7:30-9am ,never saw it - were on vacation - whos getting up and out that early on the weekend??,",0
I would recommend the place to anyone on a budget as you get a clean room for the money but I dont think Id stay here again.,1
"The staff were very very helpful, the rooms were wonderful Will we return??",0
You bet we will soon as possible,0
"On the good side :No People tresspassing past your door when you eventually get back ,My Room,.",0
You can have breakfast and Drinks if you do it yourself and buy the ingredients.,0
The Shower just has a small shelf to put all your stuff on.Personally I will stay elsewhere next time I am over in the dam.,0
Great location and service,0
My wife and I stayed at Casa Alta Vista for 2 nights in December.,0
"Overall, the room was worth the price.",0
"The room we had was small but had enough room for two people ,assuming you arent spending much time in the room,.",0
The bathroom was sufficient and for the most part clean.,0
"We actually had a spectacular view of the mountains from a small window in our shower ,Rm #12,.",0
"The service was excellent and we found that the staff went out of their way to accomodate us ,make dinner reservations, give directions, taxi pick-ups, etc.,.",0
"We also had our own patio area where where we could hang wet clothes, snokel gear, etc. ,seperate patio but not secluded from view of other rooms,.",0
Esperanza main strip is only 5 min walk from hotel.,0
"A few minor down sides were tin roof ,we had 3rd floor room and heavy rains were LOUD,, roosters making noise quite often ,yes, even in middle of night,, and rental charges for everything ,bikes, towels, chairs, etc.,",0
We rented bikes for $15/day from hotel but they were in pretty poor condition.,0
We were able to bike all the way to Blue Beach but it took an hour and was difficult since bikes were stuck in low gear.,0
Be careful snorkeling at Red Beach.,1
We swam out to island about 100 yds off shore only to realize that current on way in was very strong.,0
I would not suggest doing this without fins unless you are VERY strong swimmer and even take caution with fins if you are a strong swimmer.,1
Currents can be dangerous and ther are no warnings.,0
Snorkeling really wasnt worth the effort.,0
"Note that if you plan to rent a car, many rental places have minimum 3 day rentals during high season.",1
"The small, basic rooms are made up for by the great location and roof top views.",0
The convenience store downstairs is nice to grab a snack or a 6-pack of beer.,0
Im guessing this is one of best accomadations near Esperanza for this price range.,0
Our favorite beach was Blue Beach and Playa Luna.,0
If you get there in the morning you can easily have 300 yds of sand to yourself.,1
We loved the beaches on Vieques and the lack of crowds made it all the more wonderful.,0
Dare I say Perfect?,0
"Each time I vist, they increasingly treat me like a king -- meeting me at my taxi/car whereupon four or five people greet me by name, escorting me to my ,always upgraded room, via private elevator.",0
"And, if you are not wealthy, you should visit the cafe anyway.",1
Have an expensive coffee and pastry and soak in the sublime atmosphere.,0
"For all the wealth that flows here, you will NOT feel out of place or of a lesser class.",0
Every guest is treated with near-honor.,0
"Sure, there are hiccups from time to time, but just speak up -- they will apologize and go beyond in making things right.",0
Among the finest hotels in Paris -- and the world.,0
"It is well located, near Union Square with lots of shops and restaurants nearby.",0
"The staff are friendly and the rooms, while small, are clean and well furnished.",0
"There is free wireless Internet access in the rooms and another nice touch is the free glass of wine served between 5 and 6 - this ensures the guests gravitate to the lounge and creates a warm, friendly atmosphere.",0
We had breakfast in the restuarant and it was good although there are plenty of other good restaurants and diners nearby.,0
The only fault we would find is in the lack of tea and coffee making facilities in the rooms.,0
"All in all, a good value mid range hotel.",0
The hotel is well located and the renovated rooms were adequate in terms of size and amenities but I would not rate them 4 star.,0
Some areas of the hotel need upgrading.,0
"We found the service variable, ranging from very helpful to down right rude and argumentative when we checked in having used a booking service instead of the hotels direct system.",0
Otherwise I would look elsewhere.,0
Great place and great people...,0
I really liked this place and will go back.,0
You can find specials and packages on their website..,1
"The drinks and the view at the bar on the roof are great, but the sushi was average.",0
The staff is awesome.,0
I was a little dubious about this hotel after reading some of the reviews,0
I took a chance due to our flight getting in a little late.,0
"It is an ideally located hotel as we got off great airport express to Alexanderplatz, came out the station at the foot of the hotel.",0
"Reception staff smiley and helpfull, okay the room was small but spotless, well comfy beds, great view across berlin and breakfast well and truly fed us.",0
For 168 quid two adults three nights B and B you cannot be robbed,0
overall a great hotel.,0
"First and formost this hotel is a nice property, how ever the rooms are not at all as they tell on the website.",0
"I booked a one bedroom ,bedroom, being a key word there, Suite....It was not a suite by any defiinition.",0
It was a normal sized regular room with a pull down bed with a small divider in the middle of the beds.,0
THATS NOT A SUITE....THATS A LOAD OF CRAP.,0
I reserved a top floor suite with ocean veiw.....they put me on the first floor over looking a ton of screaming kids.,0
"When I called to ask about it, I was told that the was not the case and that the internet website does not have a second tv listed for the one bedroom suite....and low and behold...it does.",0
"As I was on my first floor balcony smoking a ciggarette to calm my nerves from dealing with this, somone from a top floor decided to spit and hit me in the back on my head and my hand.",0
Imagine the anger.,0
"You book a top floor, you get first floor, you booked a suite, and got a room...you go out to your balcony to relax...and someone from a top floor....,which you reserved, has just spit on the back of your head.",0
The hotels idea of compensasion was breakfast for two.,0
"NOT A NEW ROOM, NOT A SUITE, NOT A TOP FLOOR...but breakfast.",0
"Yay After 2 hours of dealing with the floor manager, Matthew Sims,If you ever have to deal with this man, go above him.",1
"He will do nothing but smile in your face and tell you have a nice day after he has ruined it.,",0
"I decdied to find another hotel, at a higher rate, and after driving 4 hours on no sleep after working a 12 hour shift.",0
Seems like this would be the end of the nightmare right? WRONG,0
"Two days after the ordeal with the Newport Beachside Resort I was on my way home, and decided to pull money out of my account for the turnpike home.",0
The NewPort Beachside Resort had put a charge hold on my debit card.,0
"I called, and spoke with Matthew Sims once again just to be laughed at and told to have a nice day.",0
"I decided that Mr. Sims would change his tune when he was confronted with this issue in person, and in front of other guests....I was wrong.",0
I was disgusted and appauled by his actions.,0
"The other manager ,Mr. Valdez, was very helpfull and helped me on my way.",0
So on the way home I was once more reminded of my vacation stay at the Newport Beachside Resort when I had to be embarassed and use my high intrest credit card to pay for dinner.,0
"This hotel ruined not only my weekend, but my vacation and the relaxation I hoped to get.",0
Feel free to contact me via E-mailZacharias J ReisPba_fla@yahoo.com,0
Have just returned from a weekend in Barcelona with 12 girlfriends who all had a fantastic time at the H10 Marina.,0
"We found the staff ,especially the reception and bar staff, extremely friendly.",0
"Our weekend got off to a bad start when one girl had her purse pinched on the metro ,be very careful, but the reception staff were very helpful and told us exactly what we needed to do and where the police station was.",0
They also gave her some vouchers for a couple of free drinks,0
"I read some negative reviews on here before our visit regarding the rooms - all our rooms were clean, spacious ,they accommodated an extra bed in double rooms to make things cheaper, the air conditioning worked and the windows opened.",0
"The roof top pool, ok is on the small side but the beach is only 5 minutes walk away if you need more water",1
I really could not fault this hotel - the lobby and bar area is spacious and the breakfast had a wide range to suit all tastes.,0
I would have no hesitation in returning to this hotel.,0
If I was to give one tip then take a taxi from the airport - we got the train and then the metro but had to make few changes along the way.,1
Our minibus which the hotel booked for us returning to the airport only cost 55 euros between 6 of us.,0
Great place to stay,0
We have now stayed at the Nob Hill Motor Inn three times and have been there several nights each time we were in San Franscisco.,0
We have never been disappointed.,0
"The people who run this inn are very helpful, friendly, and resourceful.",0
"Our room has always been very clean, quiet, and comfortable.",0
It is located conveniently close to public transportation and we have always been given good directions at the front desk.,0
We definitely will go back the next time we visit the area.,0
"Rene Wildeman replied immediately and the reservations department got back to me letting me know they would try to put us together, and then offered us an upgrade for $31 per night per room.",0
"We accepted it, and was glad we did since I saw a regular room later on and it was tiny.",0
I am pretty sure our luggage would not fit in there.,0
We took the train from Schipol to Central Station and then walked the straight road to the hotel.,0
It was about 7 mins away.,0
"Check in was prompt, the desk people were very friendly and the rooms were ok.",0
They were dark since they were in the back with no view at all but the size of the rooms were amazing.,0
I did not like the toiletries that came with the hotel however.,0
The shampoo felt like watered down laundry detergent.,0
"Also, a warning, be careful of what you sign up for as wireless internet.",1
We were told to open the internet page and follow instructions to sign up for internet.,0
"Well, we turned on my laptop and Tmobile came up.",0
"So we signed up for it, and lost signal right after that.",0
Turns out that was not what the hotel offered.,0
"So, I will now have to dispute those charges since the connection was bad and I did not get access at all except for the first few mins it needed the credit card number.",0
It was in the middle of the tourist section.,0
"After I saw where the Crowne Plaza and Marriott was located, I was glad I won the Red Leeow bid, since we like being in the center of touristy things and this was it.",0
"The RDL was literally a block away, we could be there in about 5 mins.",0
"Loved Extase coffee shop, people in Amsterdam were so so friendly I cant begin to say enough",0
"Remember to buy water from the supermarket near Madame Tussauds, much cheaper than anywhere else.",1
We were charged city taxes of 5.66 euros per night per room.,0
Room service was quick and efficient.,0
"Only once did we come back and see that housekeeping had kept a bag of trash on the bathroom sink and had forgotten to remove it, however someone came up in seconds after I called the front desk and had it cleared and kept on aplogizing.",0
"There was an electric kettle in the rooms with cups, coffees, teas, sugar and creamer.",0
The only thing I did not like was the absence of an iron in the room.,0
I was told we would need to go to the ironing room on the third floor to iron...which felt wierd.,0
We also asked if we could keep one room till about 1pm and check out from the other two rooms since our flight was at 5pm and we were planning to leave the hotel around 2pm.,0
great experience except... ...for the concierge problem.,0
We actually stayed at this W twice in ten days.,0
When we got to the bottom of the staircase leading to check-in the bellman could not have been nicer.,0
He got an extra guy to help with all of our gear.,0
"Both check ins were smooth, staff lovely, room was great.",0
"The second check-in was particularly nice, as one of the young ladies behind the desk made a special point to welcome my son back to the hotel with a high five and Its great to see you again.",0
Went a long way.,0
"We had a view of Mt. Rainier the first leg, lower down the second.",0
Room service during both stays was excellent.,0
"The lobby was lovely to hang out in, the restaurant was very, very good.",0
To the concierge problem...we dealt with three concierges during our stays.,0
"Two of which were fine, one simply didnt do his job or meet our requests.",0
"First, he was on his cell phone at the concierge desk and seemed annoyed that we interrupted him.",0
We wanted to make dinner reservations for two nights and asked whether we needed reservations for a third restaurant.,0
"It was early in the day, he said the first two would not be open, but would make the reservations later and noted it on the computer.",0
He then said we did not need reservations at the third.,0
"Hmmm, basic info a concierge should know.",0
We walked back to the hotel to check on the other reservations with the evening concierge.,0
Neither had been made.,0
He was very apologetic and expressed that this had been a problem for a number of guests that day.,0
He took care of the reservations and found us another place to eat that evening.,0
"Despite the intitial problem, it was dealt with in a more than satisfactory way and we would absolutely stay there again.",0
A great value in a prime location,0
We were staying at the Pan Pacific for our anniversary and booked our trip through priceline.,0
"According to the Pan Pacifics rates, the cheapest room in the place is $340 per night, but we found a great all-inclusive deal that averaged out to about $100 per night.",0
"The service was above average, but not as excellent as all of the reviews that I had read.",0
"The staff was friendly and helpful, especially at the concierge desk.",0
"After a long travel day, our room wasnt ready when we arrived, and it took a little prompting on my part to speed up the process - which I shouldnt have to do.",0
"Everything else was extremely positive after that, though.",0
The concierge was very helpful in booking us a rental car.,0
The room was very clean and nicely decorated.,0
"Its not a huge room, but we werent in our room very often anyways.",0
"The workout room on the 5th floor was nice, and it seemed to be getting regular use from the hotel guests.",0
It was maintained very well.,0
"We didnt eat at the restaurant, and it didnt look as though it received a lot of business.",0
"The menu looked great, but was pricey.",0
Housecleaning was fantastic,0
They really did a nice job each day on our room.,0
The Pan Pacific is convenient for getting on the bus line and trolley lines.,0
Most lines were 1-3 blocks away.,0
"Finally, I liked the 3rd floor lobby.",0
"It was a good choice for placing the lobby, as we didnt have to walk through crowds to get to our room.",0
We could just bypass all of that with the elevator.,0
By the way - the glass elevators are a nice touch,0
We will definitely stay at the Pan Pacific again.,0
"We encountered many other tourists at different SF sights asking us where we were staying, and they said that we were lucky to be there because of the reputation of the place.",0
"Plus, many others werent enamored with their accomodations.",0
"That felt good to know that on our first trip, we hit it on the mark with our hotel choice",0
"Problem #1, the remote control for the television did not work.",0
"They finally responded to the problem 3 hours later and offered to switch my room, which was not an opinion because I had already unpacked.",0
Problem #2 when I went to turn on the AC I noticed that there where ants crawling on top of the unit.,0
Problem #3 At about 9:45am housekeeper enter my room while I was in bed.,0
When she noticed I was there she ran out of the room.,0
I recieved a knock at my door around 11:00am by another housekeeping to clean the room.,0
"I then asked the housekeeper if she could give me 5 minutes, because I was on my way out and she said yes.",0
"When I exited the room, she appeared to be entering the room to clean, but when I returned at 2:30pm the room was still in the same condition which made me angry because I had returned to the room to rest.",0
"I immediately came out and approached another housekeeper, who informed that she was sending someone right away.",0
"I waited for another 45 minutes, still no one.",0
"I then went to the front desk where a gentleman gave me, the guest, directions to housekeeping so that I could inquire on my behalf because he was too busy on the phone.",0
He should have been the one to resolve the matter.,0
"She left a roll of gabage bags on the bathroom sink, I guess that was for me to do.Overall, I did not care for the service that I recieved.",0
"The room had an odor , its a good thing I brought the febreeze,, and next time I think Ill spend the extra money and get something decent because this hotel was far from it.",0
Great hotel Hotel was conveniently located steps from a subway station and key bus routes.,0
Desk staff was friendly and very helpful at booking tours and providing directions.,0
"Only downside was lack of air conditioning in rooms, but in May, it was fine and could open windows to let cool air in when it got warm.",0
Breakfast had a lot of variety and was very good Would definitely stay there again,0
For euro hotels the room was spacious and kept to a high standard.,0
Only minor point was that they are strict about no ironing in the room and no in room tea/coffee in normal double rooms.,0
"However if you are travelling with a laptop they provide free internet in the rooms ,decent speed ~2mbps, ask at reception for pass code.",1
"Its less than a 5min walk from the station, so is a perfect base for visiting florence and surrounding towns/cities.",0
The italian train system is cheap and v.reliable.,0
"While there we visitied places like Pisa ,1hr, and Viareggio ,beaches 1hr 20mins, by train.",0
Also the staff are very friendly and it is based near a variety of restaurants/bars and clubs.,0
"Great location, rooms questionable",0
My husband and I stayed here during a conference last week and it was alright.,0
The concierge was very informative and the front staff very polite.,0
The room cleaning was questionable though as they did not remove empty water bottles the whole time we stayed.,0
"They also only dumped the garbage, they did not replace the lining.",0
I think that towels were just refolded and replaced instead of giving new towels.,0
The showers were actually very small although there was excellent pressure from the showerhead.,0
"We didnt dine at the hotel, although we heard firsthand that there was one restaurant that was very slow in service ,main course took 2 hours,.",0
"The location of this hotel was good, the subway station was not too far away.",0
"If I had to go to Boston again, I may look elsewhere to stay.",0
Stayed here for a night with some friends for a wedding.,0
The hotel staff was rude and acted like a bunch of premadonas.,0
Everyone assoctated with this place thought their you know what didnt stink.,0
I would highly reccommend a hotel called The Phoenix over this place.,1
At least there you can get good service and a more confortable experience.,0
Unless you are into travel nightmares.,0
"We arrived in our car after a long journey from Las Vegas, and we were very tired.",0
"After we arrived, the bell men took our luggage into the hotel, and our car was parked for us.",0
We had requested connecting rooms when we booked and there were no problems at all with this.,0
We have stayed in numerous hotels before and more than half did not give us connecting rooms.,0
We went up to the rooms.,0
"The rooms were slightly outdated, with stripy coloured wall-paper, and country style curtains.",0
"Yet, the rooms had a balcony, plus the bed was a tempur one.",0
"Since we were tired, we ordered rooms service.",0
"The menu was pretty good with a choice of steaks, pizzas, pastas and salads.",0
The meal arrived in about 35 minutes and was v.good.,0
"The hotel is located about 15-20 minutes from central Hollywood, and is right in the center of Beverly Hills, on Beverwil Drive.",0
"Staff were friendly, and service was excellent.",0
"Breakfast wasnt to good, and the rooms could do with some updating.",0
"Overall, it was a really good hotel.",0
Great place to stay,0
I was very happy with our stay here.,0
"Even with the weak dollar, I thought it was a great value.",0
Brilliant Berlin base,0
We stayed 4 nights here on a first visit to Berlin.,0
"We had a family suite for 3 adults - it was huge, comfortable and clean.",0
Its in a good position to see the sites of old East Berlin and close to public transport to go further afield.,0
The only meal is breakfast and we tended to go out for that - cheaper,0
There are good coffee bars and restaurants nearby.,0
There is a small bar and the staff are very friendly and helpful.,0
Nice upper end place,0
"Very nice hotel, but rooms are small and area is newer live/work type.",0
Be sure to get the larger room and have breakfast included as it is $25 if you pay.,1
"Nice food due to the French Chef on staff, but pricey.",0
"Doesnt feel like Japan hotel, more like a contemporary Hilton.",0
"If you want to feel the city vibes and eat close by at more authentic restaurants, dont stay here.",1
"If you want out of the hustle more modern surroundings, this is your place.",1
Nothing Exciting Stayed here for one night before moving over to The Phoenician.,0
"While not bad, it certainly lacks many of the finer qualities of the areas better establishments ,Four Seasons, Phoenician, Fairmont Scottsdale Princess,.",0
Located in a so so area of North Phoenix.,0
The room itself had a popcorn ceiling and poorly textured walls.,0
It struck me that if 6 Motel ever decided they wanted to go resort style this would be the place that they would open up.,0
"The comforter and bedding, as well as the entire interior, were all standard Hilton - nothing to connote the southwest ,the comforter was a loudy itchy green floral print,.",0
"The wash basin was also located in the bedroom ,not in the bathroom, which struck me as odd and does not help matters when one person is an earlier riser than another.",0
My wife and I were given a view which overlooked a parking lot and other peoples balconies.,0
"Its a good 20 minute drive to the center of Scottsdale ,if youre looking to dine at one of the many fine dining spots in the Scottsdale area.",1
"While not bad for families looking to save a little, it is not the luxurious resort for which it bills itself.",0
"And it is far, very far, from being even one of the top 5-6 resorts in the area.",0
The weather was really tropical and sunny.,0
It was in the mid-80s during the day and the 70s at night.,0
Perfect-especially considering it was 8 at home in Michigan.,0
The best resort experience we have ever had.What we really liked...1.,0
The suites were neat and well maintained.,0
We read about a musty smell in the rooms.,0
We were able to eliminate this by opening the patio doors for a couple of hours each day and by keeping the lid closed on the toilet.,0
The grounds were beatiful and at night the ground lighting created a romantic effect in the landscaping.,0
It was quiet and peaceful almost all of the time.,0
Not many loud drinking parties.,0
The staff was friendly and energetic.,0
They performed task with a positive attitude.,0
We often observed them singing to the background music.,0
They were not intrusive or or patronizing.,0
They carried themselves with dignity and were appreciative of tips-while not acting as though they expected to be tipped.,0
The beach had numerous palm thatched cabanas.,0
We able to reserve one every day.,0
We spent most of the day on the beach.,0
You could be in the sun or in the shade.,0
The water was a tropical blue with darker shading over the coral reefs.,0
There was constant activity on the beach and just off shore.,0
People constantly walked the beach-about 10% of the women are topless.,0
"There are power boats, sail boats para sails up and down the beach.",0
The snorkeling in front of the Bavaro was very good and snorkel equipment was free for one hour each day.,0
"Yellow tail snapper, some a foot long, and barracuda, sargeant fish, and tripletail were within 200 feet of the beach.",0
We are in our 50s and enjoyed the contact with the families with young children.,0
The parents and the children were well mannered.,0
The staff does a nice job entertaining the children.,0
Every night the kids were involved in putting on little shows.,0
The food was generally of good quality-but not necessarily geared to American tastes.,0
You had to pick and chose.,0
"We liked the grilled foods the best- chicken, lobster, steak and the chips and salsa.",0
"On Wednesday night, they serve lobster at the buffet.",0
Choose to go to the specialty resturants on other nights.,1
We liked the Japenese and the Steakhouse the best.,0
"Most of the drinks were rum drinks, but you could get other types of drinks on request.",0
Not professional management,0
I stayed at the RIU the last time I visited Miami.,0
"While there, a hurricane came through.",0
"Because of the large amounts of water, my room flooded, as did many others.",0
My room was on the top floor and the ceiling leaked badly.,0
The hotel was sold out and I could not move to another room.,0
"They did have one room available, but it was leaking as well.I spoke to the manager, Joanna Turmo, about my room.",0
"She offered to, take care of my parking during my stay.",0
"However, what makes me angry is that when I try to contact the manager, Joanna Turmo, she will not take my calls, or return my calls.",0
"As I said earlier, she offered to, take care of me, the next time I visited Miami.",0
"So, if you ever have a bad experience at this hotel and they promise you something, you better get it in writing because Joanna Turmo will not come to the phone.",1
Not worth the reputation,0
The staff said I need to pay at least 5000 yens to change to another deluxe room for better view.,0
There is a lot of high tech inside the room but some is just too high tech and not useful and even dangerous.,0
"They used Lavazza coffee cooker to provide the hot water, which is very dangerous.",0
"I know how to Assembly a computer and write web page , but I dont know how to get hot water safely.",0
I cannot stop the hot water coming out from the machine.,0
There is no fruit complementary despite some website say it is provided.,0
If you have been living in Hong kong peninsula you know it is totally different thing.,0
"The cafe downstairs is terrible, decoration is bad and smelly.",0
"the second thing, just over the bridge, is the Hotel Antiche Figure, and what a welcome sight",0
"The location is perfect for bus and train station,and the water buses are right there.",0
"We found the staff at the hotel charming and helpful, and the accommodation very good.",0
The recommended local restaurants were excellent.,0
No better place to stay in Venice.,0
"A good value, with a few kinks",0
We stayed at the Palladium Grand Bavaro.,0
The hotels grounds are immaculate.,0
"The room ,a Romance Suite, was very spacious and near both the beach and pool.",0
We booked through Apple Vacations and their staff was competent and helpful.,0
"Apple had 2 reps on duty in the hotel lobby and, since they spoke excellent English, they could help us with some of the kinks we had with the hotel.",0
"very clean, incredible beach, ample bars and watering holes all around the campus, excellent athletic facilities, and again cannot overemphasize the friendly staff.",0
"I would recommend this place, but arm yourself with good information from people who have stayed there before.",1
"On your way in, grab one of the oodles of people checking out and get their advice.",1
I think the pitfalls I discuss below could be avoided if you know what youre up against from the outset.,1
Rooms in punta cana dont really have views.,0
"Beaches are monopolized by beach huts and restaurants, so dont expect a room right on the water.",0
"No snorkeling right on the hotels beach ,too many waves and no reef,, so you have to book a separate excursion.",1
Hotel extremely clean and everything extremely well manicured.,0
"Wouldnt recommend horse back riding in Punta Cana, as horses are malnourished and are not what you would be used to.",0
",Hotel does not have horses, you would book this separately,.",0
"Expect, as with all beach hotels in Punta Cana, people to solicit you frequenty on the beach for tourism trips and excursions, etc.",0
"This can get rather annoying, but the people are friendly enough,.",0
"Tip: if you want a beach chair at the beach or pool, go there before 9am or so and put your magazine or towel on your chair.",1
There arent enough to go around,0
The more frustrating kink was the hotels dinner reservation system.,0
"At check in, we were given 2 dinner reservation tickets for reservations in one of the Fiesta resorts many alla carte restaurants ,vs. the large buffets where reservations are not necessary,.",0
We were told to make the reservation at the Customer Relations desk.,0
"First, the line to make reservations was long ,wait time ranged from 10-25 mins,.",0
"When we finally got to talk to the Customer Relations representatives ,not very experienced ,, they flipped through the book for each restaurant and told us that all slots were taken.",0
"They put us on the wait list, which looked really long.",0
"We ended up getting a reservation at La Uva, for Wed night at 6pm ,oh well,, but we did not get another reservation the rest of the week.",0
"At first, we were worried, since we were not impressed by the large buffet at the Grand Palladium.",0
We were relieved to discvover that the buffet at the Palace was much better - excellent really.,0
"So we enjoyed 3 excellent meals, however only one of them was at one of the promised alla carte restaurants.",0
"However, exceedingly frustrating was that the alla carte restaurants were never more than 35 percent full, that we saw, during any dinner time.",0
"This means that the hotel wasdeliberately limiting the number of available reservations at the more intimate and more labor intensive alla carte restaurants, and in doing so were steering people to the much more cost efficient buffets.",0
"We found the lack of available reservations, and the logistics of the reservation system in general ,you dont find out if you have a dinner reservation until the afternoon - or evening -",0
"you are supposed to be dining there, to be very frustrating.",0
"We thought it was really false advertising, since a diversity of restaurants was promised.",0
"I tried to speak to a manager about this complaint, but was given the brush off.",0
"I let it go since it was, afterall, our vacation and I did not feel like fighting with someone.",0
Poor Hotel and Staff,0
We went to Bannigans next door which is adequate for a supper and a beer.,0
"The following morning I was up at 5.30 am and wanted a coffee once again this was not available until 6am, WHY ?",0
"The breakfast consisted of doughnuts and muffins, if you were quick enough.",1
"As I booked through Carnival I assumed the hotel would be of a decent standard, Carnival should look at this part of the operation, the feel good experience should start when we get to Miami.",0
If you have a choice DONT STAY HERE.,1
What an AMAZING resort,0
My husband and I just returned from Bahia Principe after spending 1 week from May 19th-May 26th.,0
"To sum up, the holiday from beginning to end was perfect.",0
The resort is a tropical paradise.,0
"These are the best points :- well maintained grounds-amazing, friendly, helpful staff , our maid was incredible, - Perfect manicured beach - An abundance of chairs in the shade at the pools and beach, Could still get a chair at 9:30-10ish, - Food was very good and very vegetarian accomodating.",0
"We were only able to eat at one of the a la carts, The Italian, because the other ones did not have a non-vege option.",0
But the buffet was delicious and diverse enough to keep our palettes satisfied-,0
"We were not able to upgrade , we arrived at 8:30pm, and they said that all the upgrade rooms were booked, but in my opinion the regular booking suffised.",0
I didnt feel that I was treated any differently or missed out on anything.,0
"They rate this resort as a 5 star, and it truly is.",0
"We have been to Sandals Jamaica, Cuba and Cancun and this is by far the best we have visited.",0
Great resort,0
We had a wonderful two week vacation at Riu Palace Macao.,0
This was our second time at this resort and we enjoyed iteven more than the first time,0
"The kids ,7 years old, had a great time and are already asking when we are going to go back.",0
Never crowded and it has both sunny and shaded areas.,0
The shade is provided by the beautiful palm trees.,0
"There is alway a breeze from the ocean, so it never feels too hot.",0
 The Staff is simply outstanding.,0
Everyone here seem to enjoy their work and it shows.,0
They are always smiling and try to make you feel special.,0
We did not have any problems with AC or moist bedding that some people have complained about.,0
The AC worked fine and the room was very clean.,0
"We asked for extra bedding sheets for the kids and they brought them right away, though the next day the maid took them away, and when we called to ask for them again, they brought a whole bed instead - talk about the language barrier",0
"Johny does an excellent job with Bingo, always drawing plenty of laughs from the audience.",0
"We saw a couple of shows ,International and Michael Jackson, and liked them.",0
We ate mostly at the buffet.,0
"There were plenty of choices and I especially enjoyed the seafood - calamari, grouper, salmon, shrimp, were really good.",0
The sparkling wine is really good and can become addictive.,0
I was having about 5 glasses per day toward the end of the second week.,0
I did not like the red or white wines.,0
The beer was good.,0
The view and breeze from the ocean makes this place really awesome.,0
"Also, they offer burgers and hot dogs for lunch for those who need their fix of junk food.",0
"If you enjoy a great Marguerita or a Pina Colada, sadly you are not gonna get it here.",0
"Most drinks are made in kind of a big slushy machine, as opposed to a mixer.",0
The bartender just adds liquor to it and here you go.,0
"That said, my wife and kids enjoyed virgin pina coladas very much.",0
Overall the vacation was excellent and we are definitely going to come back in the furture,0
Westin St Francis is a stunning hotel overall,0
I stayed for three nights at the Westin St Francis in the newer tower building.,0
As there were no twins available I had originally booked a standard double in the historic building but was shown to a standard queen room instead.,0
"The room was beautiful, though small, and everything was neat and clean.",0
I had read reviews on this site that the older smaller rooms were dated and dirty but this was not the case at all.,0
"I did however get an extremely strange feeling in the room, and was not keen to stay for a reason that is unknown to me",0
"We asked to be upgraded to the newer part of the hotel for an additional $35.00 per night, and as we left the old part of the hotel I mentioned to my sister that my right ear started ringing loudly as soon as we entered the room.",0
She said her right ear was also ringing in the historic room... very spooky,0
"Anyway, having upgraded to the tower room with two queen beds, we had absolutely no complaints.",0
"The room was massive, and the bathroom was incredible",0
"The beds were heavenly as promised, and the dual shower was great too.",0
It was well worth the extra money for the upgrade.,0
"The only thing even slightly disapointing was the view, ,of some old buildings,, but you cant have everything.",0
Staff were friendly and helpful and the public areas of the hotel are stunning.,0
I really enjoyed watching the documentary on the hotel tv channel about the history of the St Francis- fascinating,0
I would definitely love to return to the St Francis in the future.,0
"Location is perfect for RLD, Teasers is a lively bar just down the road, also Tara ,good Irish bar, further down on Rokin.",0
"Beds were clean, towels changed each day, no sign of bed bugs ,despite extensive searching on arrival,.",0
"Gets noisy in the morning with street cleaners so forget the lie in go to Barneys in Jordaan ,Haarlemerstraaat, for breakfast instead, much more fun ,can I have some more pancakes with extra maple syrup please,.",0
Reception has safe deposit box if you need it.,1
"No complaints, hotel served its purpose admirably.",0
Be careful not to wander into attic late at night though as carpet is very damp.,1
We spent New Years Eve in this wonderful Hotel.,0
He is an amazing source of information.,0
I have to agree with most of the other reviews on this property.,0
"The location is perfect, the staff are mostly fantastic.",0
There are some who seem to be just doing a job but this is compensated by the others who are the best.,0
The food and wine on level 2 is a great option and my kids loved being able to go down and snack.,0
The suite we had was great and the option of the fold out sofa made things better for the four of us.,0
My only negative is that the beds were too short.,0
"I am only six foot one, so not overly tall, but my feet were always hanging over the end of the bed which is uncomfortable.",0
"This is unusual and may be due to size of the rooms but for such a well thought out hotel, I thought this was a significant issue.",0
"Despite this, I would stay at Casablanca again if I was lucky enough to come to New York.",0
Reviews are correct,0
We stayed only 1 night after a cruise with Carnival.,0
The hotel is great.,0
It is very clean and yet has the rustic appeal of the oldbusiness it used to be.,0
Many of the buildings in the French Quarter are very run down do to their age.,0
But this hotel was completely renovated in 2004 and remains well maintained.,0
We had a room facing Magazine street which had 18ft ceilings and windows to match - beautiful.,0
We were very close tothe French Quarter but in quiet area.,0
We also felt very safe.,0
"We ate at Cafe du Monde, Johnny Poboys, and Mothers.",0
All very good - only dont expect to be waited on .,1
These are old time diners which have become famous for their food.,0
Cleanliness is not a priority in this area - so go with that in mind.,1
Very glad we experienced New Orleans.,0
New Orleans is a must for every American.,1
Had a great time,0
I was at the Iberostar Bavaro with friends and family.,0
Everyone we traveled with was 19 and older and I must say I am happy we chose the Bavaro.,0
Alot less young kids and most of the beach and crazy activities were next door at the dominican so basically our hotel was very relaxing.,0
Check in went smoothly.,0
Hector at the front desk was great.,0
"Our rooms honestly were a bit smaller then I was expecting but very clean , nice and AC worked great.",0
The repfrom Go Go another Hector was also great.,0
We did Zip Lining which was great and the caribean festival catamaran.,0
We swam with sharks and sting rays.,0
"A few went on the ATVs and loved it, but a bit more dangerous.",0
We loved the beach Bar and julio mayo and Noe.,0
At night there is not much Adult entertainment.,0
The 19 year olds and the 22 year olds went to the Star rock cafe at night.,0
They met alot of people there.,0
We went in early.,0
Very long days with scuba and excursions.,0
We ate mostly at the buffet that had great choices.,0
The steak house and japaneese restaurants were great.,0
Make your reservations as soon as you get there.,1
Make sure you bring plenty of sun tan lotion-very expensive in the gift shop.,1
"Also bring comfy shoes, ALOT of walking, take advantage of the golf carts to bring you to the other hotels at night.",1
They will also drop you right off at your room if you ask.,1
"Also it really doesnt matter where your room is located, each section has its benefits.",0
"We were in 1317 upper unit, directly behind the beach bar, for us that was great.",0
If you are traveling with younger kids you might want your rooms closer to the Dominica for the pool and beach activities.,1
Also it was verrry HOT.,0
"Dont go crazy worrying about fancy evening wear, pack as little as possible and bring a clip for the hair.",1
All the employees there could not have done more or been nicer.,0
I like a nice glass of wine in the evening and would like a bit of AC with it.,0
Wyndham - Great Location,0
My husband and I just returned from a 4-day weekend in Boston and had a great time.,0
"We stayed at the Boston Wyndham and found it was close to many of the attractions, especially Fanueil Hall/Quincy Market.",0
We took many of the reviewers advice and signed up for the Wyndham By Request.,0
We were able to check-in at 10:30am when we arrived and later in the afternoon received our complimentary snack and drink.,0
The staff was very friendly and always willing to help with any questions.,0
"The only thing we found that our room did not have were drawers to keep our clothes in, so we had to live out of our suitcases.",0
"Other than that, our room was very clean and quiet.",0
Some suggestions for those going for a long weekend trip .... Book the Beantown Trolley Tour.,1
It is the only 2-day tour you can get on and off the trolley at the different stops.,0
"Buy your tickets at the Wharf, not the concierge - they only have 1-day passes.",1
We used this as our main transportation for the first two days and we saw basically everything without getting too overwhelmed.,0
Walking the Freedom Trail also helped.,0
"If you go to Salem, take the Trolley Tour.",1
This gives you the basic idea of the city and you can get on and off the trolley.,0
"You will have to take the train to get to Salem, too.",0
This was very easy and the concierge gave us train times and directions.,0
"If you are looking for a few nice dinner restaurants, we loved Legal Seafood , at the Wharf, and Plaza III Kansas City Steakhouse , at Fanueil Hall/South Market,.",1
Both were very good.,0
"Plaza III is pricey, but well worth the money",0
"Also, if you are going during baseball season, you will have to buy a Red Sox hat, T-shirt, etc.",1
It is all over the city and you will defintely catch the fever,0
"Go to a game, too.",1
"It was so much fun and there are plenty of bars around the park to go to before and after , Game On and Cask n Flagon were our favorites.",0
"This hotel had a knowledgeable, professional and friendly staff - their recommendations of a Chinese restaurant in nearby Chinatown or of a restaurant in close North Beach were spot-on when I made clear my price range and my expectations.",0
The rooms had an understated elegance to them and there was considerable attention to detail - including a starched linen cloth at the foot of the bed for the slippers - a nice touch indeed.,0
The location along the cable-car track put me at one end to Market Street and a connection near the top of Nob Hill brought me into either Union Square or Fishermans Wharf in good time to enjoy the many things that San Francisco had to offer.,0
"Yet, being far enough away from the hectic activity of these places -- especially during this time of year -- made the hotel room a welcome refuge.",0
"Contrary to other reviews, I found the prices at both the restaurant and the lounge to be comparable and fair considering the location of the hotel in the Financial District and the level of service and quality provided.",0
"However, as I stated earlier, there are ample restaurants nearby from which you can choose.",1
"Finally, the use of a town car for a slightly higher fee than a taxi was an excellent touch.",0
I travelled with 3 others who had a number of bags - and a Cadillac Escalade was ready at my time of booking to take our group to the airport.,0
This truly is a superlative property.,0
"For the rate, it has to be the best value and the best comfort in San Francisco.",0
My wife and I decided to fly in early and spend a night in San Francisco.,0
After reading all the reviews we decided to stay Friday night Oct 26th at the Four Seasons.,0
I booked the reservation thru their website and got a rate of $425 for a Superior Room.,0
The moment we arrived we knew we made the right choice,0
The experience was first class all the way.,0
Check in was fast and curtious.,0
"The only little complaint I had was that the room was a corner ,#827, and the left and front were all windows so the TV was actually to the right of the bed which made watching in bed difficult.",0
Not a huge issue but worth noting.,0
"The bathroom was huge, spotless and beautiful",0
"The bed was very comfortable and the even with the 2 walls of glass, the room darkeners kept in pitch black.",0
"We ate all our meals off premises, so I can not comment on the in hotel restaurant other than it was very expensive.",0
The location is perfect and I highly recommend the spa at the attached LA sports Club.,1
Great massage,0
I have to comment to anyone who is thinking of going to a Caribbean Resort...YOUR VACATION IS AS GOOD OR BAD AS YOUR EXPECTATION.,1
If you think you are going to a American/Canadian 4-5 star resort you would be fooling yourself.,1
"As many people have commented poorly about this resort and others, you need to remember you are not at home, most of the people who live in these countries do not have large homes with 2 cars, a pool etc.",0
Their entire family lives with them in a 500 sq ft house.,0
"So the hard work, quality food, and other amenities they are providing are 10X higher than what they are used to receiving in their day to day lives.",0
"Just thought I should mention this as I have stayed at 3 star, 4 star and 5 star hotels in the Dominican and the difference between them is minimal as far as the quality of food.",0
"If you want Wolfgang Puck, you should stay home to get it.",1
"But if you open your mind and realize you are experiencing how others live, you will love it.",1
What a DUMP... there are much better accomodations for the same price,0
Stayed for one night at Casa Alta to do a bio tour.,0
This place was just disgusting.,0
If you must stay here check out the room first before you hand over your credit card.,1
"I was first given room #1, very dark and damp, had a basement feel since it was on the ground floor half buried in dirt.",0
At first the check in person at the convenience store would not give me another room stating that everything was taken until we realized that the toilet was leaking into the bedroom.,0
At first he told us to just turn the water valve off on the back of the toilet.,0
When I threatened to leave to go to another place down the road he gave us another room on the upper floor.,0
It was not much better but at least the toilet didnt leak and the sheets looked clean.,0
I was afraid to look under the mattress.,0
If it wasnt  so late at night and if I was staying more than one night I would have left.,0
The hotel is a small boutique hotel that has been recently modernised.,0
"The rooms are very clean and are the perfect base while exploring the city, ask for a room at the front of the hotel as you get your own personal little balcony.",1
The rooftop terrace offers a nice view of the city at sunset while enjoying a few evening drinks even in february I would definitely recommend this hotel and will have no hesitation in staying here again,1
Value for the price,0
I have stayed here several times for business over the last couple of years.,0
"They have nice meeting room space, and the rooms are reasonably priced.",0
"The hotel is in a convenient location, walking distance to many areas.",0
"The hotel is across from Victoria Park, which is great.",0
Many rooms have a harbor view.,0
"The rooms are recently renovated, and much improved.",0
"Very good internet access in the rooms, and wireless in areas of the hotel.",0
Room size is average.,0
Buffet breakfast is very extensive.,0
It was included in my room rate.,0
A very large variety of western and Chinese selections.,0
The lobby level has a coffee lounge that serves light snacks and is a nice gathering spot.,0
Good service overall.,0
"Terrible Behaviour, good breakfast",0
The hotel as such was good with a very good breakfast.,0
I stayed here along with a friend for more than 20 days and the behaviour of the guys at the reception was terrible.,0
"As an instance, I went to ask him about reservation and he said we will talk tomorrow morning, thanks you without even looking at me.",0
The rooms are small and there is no place to move but I guess it is ok for the price.,0
Connectivity from the hotel to all important places is good as it is right in front of the main station.,0
"The room was fine, but be forewarned, the neighboring Hilton is building a high-rise time share building right next to the Ilikai , Diamond Head side.",1
The construction noise was VERY loud.,0
"We could not sit on our 25th floor balcony and enjoy the ocean views without the daytime sounds of ear-splitting, pile-driving machines and other construction equipment.",0
"The Ilikai also permanently closed one of their two pools because the adjacent ,Yacht Harbor, tower was sold to another company.",0
I hope they update their website to advise of this.,0
"If you receive this, please note: It is NOT APPLICABLE to Sarentos , roof-top-expensive-incredible views, Restaurant.",1
"We learned this the hard way, after dining there- Front Desk Staff should have told us of this exclusion on day one but forgot ,?,.",0
"Nice hotel, great location The Luna",0
Simone is a great hotel near Victoria Station.,0
The hotel was clean and the staff was very friendly.,0
The rooms were average European size and the bathroom was very modern with plenty of hot water.,0
"As mentioned in previous reviews, there is no lift.",0
So if you have trouble with stairs request a lower floor.,1
We slept in every day so we did not try the breakfast.,0
"However, we did eat at several of the restaurants nearby and enjoyed all of them.",0
"All things considered, the Luna Simone is a great hotel and we would stay there again.",0
Ambassador recently with a couple friends.,0
The hotel itself is pretty nice.,0
The downstairs bar looked really nice.,0
"The room we stayed in had some issues with the flooring, but the size and beds were not an issue.",0
We did have a BIG problem with a member of the night staff.,0
A buddy and I were out pretty late one night drinking and having a great time.,0
When we arrived back at the hotel we had to wait outside for about an hour and a half because the lady at the front desk did not buzz us in.,0
When we complained she said you were outside for about 5 minutes basically called us liars.,0
The hotel itself is a nice location and the rooms are ok but the staff sucks.,0
A Terrific San Francisco Choice,0
Just got back from a three-night stay at The Rex and its only fair to sing this hotels praises.,0
"Location is great; the rooms are comfortable; the amenities ,morning paper, free wine in the evening, high-speed internet, are perfectly lovely; the adjoining restaurant great for breakfast ,I didnt eat dinner there, but it looked filled up when I stuck my head in,; the New Yorker magazine theme in the lobby and the library fun.",0
But what really sets it apart is the attentive staff and the above-and-beyond level of service and helpfulness.,0
Its a hotel you can feel welcome and at home at--Im convinced its one of the best buys in San Francisco.,0
The rooms were clean and the location of the hotel was great.,0
"Just in the middle of everything...Museums, Restaurants, Public Transport and lots of Shops.",0
This hotel was recommended by friends and we are very greatfull they told us about the hotel Aalders.,0
We will return very soon.,0
"Just Right This hotel is in the perfect location, especially for the touristy traveler.",0
Nothing is too far away.,0
The staff is very friendly and speak excellent english.,0
The breakfast buffet is the closest thing to an American breakfast on the Left Bank.,0
"Even after I read this hotels excellent reviews, it still exceeded my expectations.",0
The very friendly front desk staff made excellent dinner recommendations and on one occassion even accompanied me to the nearby restaurant,0
"Dont expect a room with a view, and the hotel is on a fairly busy street, but they do have live jazz nightly.",1
"If youre looking for a great place to stay on the happening Left Bank, this should be your choice - you wont regret it.",1
We just returned from a nice visit to the Copamarina last week.,0
"The grounds are beautiful, room was nice, and overall we had a good time.",0
The main issue we had was that scuba diving was not available all week.,0
"When we checked in on Tuesday we were told that there would not be any diving available until Saturday, the day we were flying back to the US.",0
The hotel employee was very nice and said that May is a slow month so the scuba employees decided to take a job all week repairing a reef that had been badly damaged.,0
She said that we could go diving through a different dive shop that is 30 minutes away.,0
"She did not say anything good about the shop, but simply said they do diving.",0
We would have to drive there or they could call us a cab.,0
My husband and I do not dive very often so we always research dive shops before we go diving with them.,0
"We had already researched the Copamarina and felt very confident that this is a solid dive shop with a good reputation, however we did not know anything about the dive shop that is 30 minutes away.",0
"We did not bring our laptop and the Copamarnia does not have any available computers, so we did not have a way to do any online research.",0
Therefore we decided not to go diving.,0
"I guess we could have driven the 30 minutes and tried to find out more about the dive shop, but we had been stuck in horrible traffic in San Juan for 3 hours and simply did not want to get back in the car.",0
"We came there expecting to dive onsite, not have to drive 30 minutes to a dive shop that may or may not be reputable.",0
"If you are not a diver, I would recommend you stay at the Copamarina because it is very nice and peaceful.",1
"We did not do the all inclusive meal plan, but I might consider it if we go back because there are not too many places nearby to eat.",0
I thought the food was good and we enjoyed the open air cafe and the music at night.,0
The only other issue we had is that you can hear everything in the room next door through the connecting locked door.,0
The first night we woke up at midnight because the people were talking and when they sneezed at 6:00 am it was so loud I thought someone was in our room.,0
I complained and was moved to a room that had a vacant room next door.,0
"However, during high season this might not be possible.",0
The doors are very thin and need some insulation.,0
"I guess the bottom line is that if you are a diver and plan to dive, I would not stay there.",1
Our experience is not isolated if you read the other reviews it happened to another reviewer in March of this year.,0
"However, if you are simply wanting a nice vacation in relaxing area then the Copamarina is a good choice.",1
Feel free to email me with questions.,0
dont trust the staff here,1
"Although most of the reviews of this hotel tell a fairly accurate picture- central, basic.",0
"attractive building, noisy and so on, we met an unexpected problem when we brought a group of 26 students.",0
"Despite very careful bookings through our agent Studylink on arrival ,late, with tired students, we found that the hotel had put us in rooms where students were expected to share beds- claiming that this was normal practice.",0
"Basically the hotel had delibearatley overbooked and told us barefaced lies to cover up, knowing there was nothing we could do about it.",0
"We had Spanish speakers with us but could do nothing- it was a take it or leave it attitude, and the same thing happened when some of our female staff were intimidated by german students in the room next door over the following days.",0
"We got around the problem of rooms by moving beds and putting some students in another hotel, which was paid for eventually by Studylink, but it made an unpleasant start to the visit.",0
"So dont trust the staff, and be prepared for them to try it on and cause problems.",1
"Great I really dont understand how people can have a bad experience with this hotel, the one thing that made it such a nice place was the staff, they are sooo friendly",0
"The room was average size for amsterdam, the breakfast very nice, usual toast, ham, cheese, jam etc, and the place was very clean.",0
Im going back there this year and will definately stay there again.,0
Nice but not for western tourists.,0
This is not exactly a tourist hotel but it is clean and comfortable.,0
"It has all the facilities of a 4 star hotel including a business centre, but beware they charge $17 for 30 minutes internet usage.",0
The hotel is located near Outram Park.,0
Taxis are readily available and the station is about a 10 minute walk away.,0
"The rooms have a modern bathroom with shower, flat screen TV, a safe in the wardrobe, a mini-bar and tea/coffee making facilities.",0
The staff were polite and friendly.,0
"As I said, its not exactly a tourist hotel but then again Singapore isnt exactly the most thrilling place on earth either.",0
Marie celeste hotel,0
Quite easy not to talk to a soul here.,0
"Its cold , clinical, joyless. ",0
"The parking is exorbitant, but drivers dont really have a choice.",0
Not the greatest,0
We are regular guests at various Embassy Suites and Hilton products.,0
"While the location is great, this one is a bust.",0
The hotel is very dated and in need of a LOT of work.,0
"Very noisy, not only within the hotel, but the construction noise ,even on the weekend, early in the morning.",0
The bathrooms are very small and have plumbing problems.,0
"Front doors of rooms are old, not very energy efficient or sound proofed.",0
"The front desk staff could use a really good lesson on manners, professionalism, and genuine hospitality.",0
They could use a little polishing up and professional conversational skills.,0
"The complimentary breakfast is great, and the staff in there is warm accomodating.",0
Managers reception is kind of sad w/ plastic cups instead of glass.,0
The pool area is nice but the pool itself could use a good scrub down.,0
"Slimey, dirty tiles.",0
"Could be a real gem since it is an older property/building and could get some of its original character back with some renovating, and better front desk staff.",0
You get what you pay for,0
"My husband and I ,both 30 years old, stayed at the Barcelo Dominican Beach from May 31 - June 7, 2008.",0
"We booked through WestJet vacations and paid $1169 per person ,taxes in, for the trip.",0
The hotel transfer was an additional $20 per person via the website.,0
"The tourist card ,$10 on entry, and departure tax ,$20, was included in the WestJet vacation package.",0
The hotel is a 20 minute bus ride from the airport.,0
"When we first checked in, we were given room 2403 ,Block 2, 4th floor, which is right by the front desk.",0
There is a $20 deposit fee to use the safety box.,0
You get this money back at the end of your trip as long as you return the key.,0
Block 2 and 3 are in the same building and right behind the main entertainment area so it gets quite noisy for the shows from 9pm-11pm daily.,0
I would suggest anything in block 5 and up if you want less noise during those hours.,1
"In the first 2 days we were moved to 4 different rooms because of various problems ,original rooms safety box was broken, then we asked to be moved to a more quiet section, then the new room they gave us wasnt made up and when no one came after 4 hours we went to the reception desk where they upgraded us to a Tropical Junior Suite for the all the inconvenience.",0
This made all the moving around worth it.,0
We had a jacuzzi in the room with a king sized bed and we were 10 steps away from the beach,0
FOOD:There is only one main restaurant for buffet.,0
"The food was mediocre and the selection is small ,compared to other resorts we have been to,.",0
The food was bascially the same day after day.,0
"The Bahia ,Brazilian, restaurant offers a mini buffet selection during lunch time.",0
"There is a third buffet restaurant but it is in the Vera Club section ,Italian folks, and Im not even sure if we were allowed there, although we did not try.",0
The a la carte restaurants: You make reservations at the front podium in the main buffet area.,0
The only seating times available are 6pm or 8pm but if you show up after 9:30pm at any of the restaurants they will just seat you.,1
There was no limit on the amount of reservations you were allowed.,0
We made our reservations each day at 11am for the same evening with no problems.,0
Japanese restaurant - There is a grill at every table so the cook makes the food in front of you.,0
"They cook up beef, chicken, seafood, cut up veggies and fried rice.",0
Each of the meats are cooked separately then combined with the veggies and then soy sauce is put on top.,0
The food comes out all tasting the same - just salty.,0
The dessert that is served is the same ones that come from the main buffet.,0
I could have done without this meal.,0
Brazilian - I would recommend this.,1
The food was simple but really good.,0
The meat on the skewers were delicious.,0
Mexican - This was okay.,0
Most of the items were deep fried.,0
I loved the chips and gucamole.,0
Italian - This was good.,0
"The best part of the meal was the appetizers: meats, cheese, and the bread",0
I ordered filet mignon with a grape sauce but what I got was more of a salsbury steak with gravy.,0
24 hour snack bar - All they ever had was pizza and popcorn. ,0
I saw hot dogs once or twice.,0
They dont have a menu posted so you have no idea what is even offered.,0
We ordered hamburgers once but the meat looked pink even after it was cooked twice.,0
MISC Beach - Ocean / beach itself is beautiful.,0
Resort does not take care of its beach though.,0
"There was garbage ,straws, cigarette butts, cups, broken glass, all over the place.",0
No garbage cans to be seen around the beach.,0
I never saw anyone walking around picking up garbage either.,0
Massages - Massage huts all over the resort.,0
These are outdoor and in the open but there is a semi private hut near the 24 hour snack bar.,0
They charge $30 an hour and it is worth it.,0
We tipped $5 per person.,0
The resort spa is separate building and they charge a lot more.,0
"Things to bring ,aside from the obvious, - Antibacterial hand soap for your room, spray air freshner, an alarm clock ,or just a clock as they do no have them in any of the rooms,, Cortizone ,for heat rashes,, Benadryl ,to stop the itching from heat rash...lol,, face cloths ,we got these one day and never saw them again,.",1
We brought mosquito repellant and After Bite but did not see a real need to use this.,0
We did however get some anti-Malaria pills from our doctor as there have been some outbreaks in the Punta Cana area this year.,0
"Tipping - We tipped the maids $2 each day, $2 at the a la carte restaurants, and $2 per bag to the bell boys as they dragged our suitcases up 4 floors when we first got there.",0
We did not frequent the bars so did not tip when we went up for the odd drink.,0
Over-all the trip was okay but a little disappointing.,0
We did not go on vacation to party and get drunk all the time.,0
"It was more to relax, enjoy the beach, and have some decent food.",0
Personally I would not go back to a Barcelo resort.,0
I have found that the Occidental Grand and Bahia Principe chains to be much better.,0
We normally go around this time every year and pay about $1500....so I guess you get what you pay for,0
"The location is the best thing about this hotel - only minutes from Circular Quay, close to the Opera House and steps from great restaurants and cafes.",0
"The staff are extremely friendly and helpfull, ready to help with anything, especially your bags, there is no elevator ,heritage building,.",0
"The rooms are small but very cozy, we would definitely stay here again.",0
The staff is helpful and pleasant.,0
Breakfast is a buffet continental repast-- the room gets crowded but the food is quite fresh.,0
"I was there for 12 nights and dont have a single criticism of the hotel, except for the crowded breakfast room.",0
"The restaurant attached to the hotel, however, is quite mediocre and very noisy, with unresponsive staff.",0
Avoid it.,1
Brilliant Hotel - would recommend to anyone.,1
We have just returned from a very pleasant 3 night stay at the Jolly Carlton in Amsterdam during the period between Christmas and New Year.,0
We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.,0
"The staff were very polite, friendly and couldnt do enough for you.",0
The room was more than adequate for our needs.,0
"It was clean and tidy and as there was a thermostat in the room, the temperature was just right.",0
We were on the 7th floor so noise was not a problem.,0
"There was a big choice at breakfast and again the staff were very friendly and quick to take your order for hot drinks and the made to order omelettes, scrambled eggs etc.",0
The hotel was in a perfect location to explore all the sights in Amsterdam.,0
"It was just over 5 minutes walk to Dam Square and a couple of minutes away from Rembrantplein where there were lots of bars, clubs and restaurants.",0
I will definitely stay that this hotel on our next trip to Amsterdam.,0
We Will Stay Here Again. ,0
"This is the second time that we are staying at Lanson Place, Hong Kong.",0
"We loved its location in Causeway Bay-a stones throw from the Causeway Bay MTR, great food outlets at Jardines Bazaar, good shopping at Times Square.",0
The room is big for HK standards and there is a small kitchenette if you need to heat up food in the microwave or cook a meal.,1
"This time, our room was in an L-shaped configuration.",0
The bedroom was a little tight but the living and study space was slightly bigger.,0
The furnishings and fittings are still in good condition.,0
"When we checked in for our stay, we were a little annoyed that we had to wait for our room to be ready even though it was 21/2 hours past the check-in time.",0
I was a little taken aback too when one of the bath towels that I wanted to use had 5 holes on it.,0
Take rooms on side or rear.,1
Tourist class accomodation but adequate.,0
My twin room was small for two and air conditioning barely adequate.,0
Staff neither gushing nor aloof.,0
Breakfast at 12 euros is pricey for what is available better to pop out to local cafe.,0
For the money I recommend this because of it position and has all the things needed.,1
Note pedestrian area of the Rambla means in the evening taxis cannot approach and a walk may be required.,1
You have to confirm your reservation,1
"I chose the Francisco Bay because it locates near the Fisherman warf with free parking space, and affordable price.",0
"At the time I checked in, the fron desks said we dont have your reservation and there is no room available",0
"They said this problem can normally happen and just sent us to the other hotel with the same owner but was much more far away ,quite not responsible,.",0
"They said I shouldnt have any problem with the distance since San Fran is a very small city, you can take the bus around.",0
I think that is not their business to judge,0
I have read from the review that there was this kind of problem before but didnt think this should happen oftenly.,0
I think they might intentionally give my room to the other with higher rates.,0
"So if you make a reservation through internet, you have to call them and confirm it",1
a tale of good and bad,0
"the butler who was a kind of concierge, and was very pushy in getting us to book excursions from which the hotel was clearly making money - this butler often made us very uncomfortable, and was not knowledgeable about Bali and gave us very poor advice which wasted our time and money.",0
But the atmosphere is soul-less.,0
"You almost never see anyone else ,apart from your butler who constantly comes to your door - even entering once without knocking,,",0
Enjoyed the Stay,0
"The hotel is a few blocks removed from the noise and activity of Waikiki, so things are a little quieter.",0
Our room was an oceanview standard with King bed on the 12th floor.,0
Not much view as its almost 2 blocks from beach.,0
"Quiet for the most part, the room was adequate but could use some minor remodeling.",0
"The restaurant was expensive so we ate locally at more moderately priced restaurants, of which there are many within easy walking distance.",0
We would definately stay again.,0
"Moderate pricing and quiet location with parking, ,Fee $9 to $12,, yet still close to the Waikiki scene made it a good choice for us.",0
The price we paid and the service provided us has not been of 5***** Quality and the reason are: Transportation to the hotel was very confusing.,0
No welcome drink or greeting upon arrival.,0
We saw it later with other arrivals.,0
Room serviceRoom service needs management.,0
Not enough towels or sometimes nothing until 6pm.,0
Bed linen was for a queen size bed.,0
We had a king size bed,0
Most of the time we got no bottle water for cleaning the teeeth or drinking.,0
No colorful bed spread.,0
The brochure and the webside looks fantastic but none of them was there.,0
No extra bedding for the night because it was sometimes cool.,0
Too much noise from other ruede guests with no manner which came home between 4am and 5am in the morning and talked for one hour in front of their room.,0
"We asked for another room, no answer.",0
Asked for another mattress because it was like you are sleeping on a stone.,0
"We called to the front desk and got promised they will change it, nothing was happen during our stay.",0
Sofas in room were dirty and damaged.,0
Bathtop curtain was to short and the bathroom was allways flooded after taking a shower.,0
"Food service French Gourmet - nice presentation but no seasoning, very bland and no taste.",0
Sakura Japanese Restaurant - the cook was from the Dom. Republic.,0
Needs no explaination.,0
"Palapa Grill Seafood Restaurant - Grilled fish overcooked, dry and fishy.",0
Lunch Buffet - not enough selection.,0
Quality was not very special and no flavour.,0
"Nobody knew whats in the chafing dishes or on all the plate, because no labelling.",0
Dolce Vita Italian Restaurant - some of the dishes were good.,0
We never tried the mexican restaurant or the brazilBeverage ServiceFront Lobby bar - Very good in the night.,0
Excellent bartenders.,0
Beach Bar - very slowBar by Hibiscus Restaurant - very unfriendly and bad set up not guest friendly.,0
We found only 4 bars and missing the other 3 which we read on the webside.,0
Waiters friendly but 70% spoke no english and was sometimes difficult to get the right thing.,0
Head waiters from the restaurants to take the order mostly unfriendly - no smile.,0
The landscaping was very beautiful and well groomed.,0
All restrooms in Restaurants were nice and cleanIn all we paid for a 5***** Hotel and got 3*** Service.,0
We are very dissapointed.,0
We heard so many complaining during our stay and hope the took some time too to let them know.,0
We were blinded with the wonderful brochure and the webside about this Hotel Paradisus.,0
We travelled all over the world and had never such a bad experience.,0
Two very dissapointed world traveller.,0
Wouldnt Hesitate to Return,0
Reservations were made via call to Personalities Hotels- all went off without a hitch.,0
$85 + parking was better than I was expecting.,0
"Directions from the hotel website were right on, check-in was completed in 30 seconds for a weekend stay.",0
"For those concerned about the neighborhood- its SF, get over panhandlers.",0
"Our corner room doubled as a fire escape, which allowed opening the window for fresh air.",0
"We were on 8th floor, so very little street noise- asked to be away from kids",0
"The room itself was small, but no smaller than other large city hotels- if you want room to walk, Id suggest taking the F down to Ferry Plaza.",1
"If I was expecting the Hyatt, Id have been disappointed, but, for someone who travels extensively for work, this beats many chains hands-down",0
Pet Friendly Find in SF,0
"We chose the Laurel Inn because it takes pets and provides parking, but found that it has a lot more going for it.",0
"The location in a quiet residential neighborhood was great for us, as it gives a different view of SF than the usual downtown one, but it could be inconvenient for some travellers.",0
"The rooms were unusually large for a city hotel, and very comfortable, with a pleasant and muted W-ish decor.",0
"Our first room had a small kitchenette, the second did not -- here, a micro wave and a small fridge would have been welcome.",0
"The front desk staff was very helpful and very welcoming, to us and to our standard poodle.",0
The parking was great.,0
"And the price was very reasonable, considering the quality of the place.",0
"We would recommend the Laurel enthusiastically to our friends, unless they need to be downtown.",1
OK hotel Stayed 2 nights.,0
"Pros: location, clean large room.",0
"Cons: free internet only in the business center which has only 2 computers with a sign ,15 minutes per guest only,.",0
"No pool, no sauna, no whirlpool.",0
Overall a good experience,0
Stayed here about 3 times in the past four years.,0
Used to stay at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel and Towers but when the rates when up found the Radisson online and it is right around the corner from the Boston Park Plaza.,0
"GREAT LOCATION: Close to the theatre district, Boston Common, Newberry Street, and the Long Wharf area.",0
The rooms are big and are fairly priced for a Boston hotel.,0
Only compaints are that the service is a little slow during busy times and during one of my stays there were three or four tiny ants on the floor.,0
Like dating a supermodel...,0
"Yes, this is a beautiful hotel, but aside from that there is nothing.",0
"Service: abysmal ,you are supposed to be assigned a peronal assistant to cater to your every whim...I got a phone number which was always busy and a front desk that could care less,.",0
"Noise: Constant ,until 4AM, front desk unapologietic, room on 3rd floor as if on the dancefloor,.",0
"Room: Large, well furnished and stylish, but the sink, toilet and bath all overflowed.",0
"Management was receptive to comments upon check out, but acknowledged that the hotel was having trouble with staffing/noise/growing pains.",0
"In the end, not even close to worth it.",0
"Pool closed, lobby torn apart and the owners",0
Refused to notify guests,0
I was supposed to stay at this hotel on Canal Street for 3 nights at the end of June using a coupon for one of them.,0
Arrived in N.O. La via Amtrak.,0
"I was advised to take a taxi to the hotel rather than the bus as, since Katrina, the buses in the area of the train station/arena/Superdome are irregular.",0
"There isnt much in the train station, but there is a Subway restaurant, some sort of coffee shop ,which may be attached to the Subway,, a small gift shop and both Amtrak and Greyhound ticket counters.",0
"A few police/sheriffs officers were present, and very polite and helpful in providing taxi info.",0
My cab driver had just gotten his tax the day before.,0
He lost everything in the storm.,0
Very nice man.,0
I cant believe that people in FEMA trailers have to pay rent on the space for the trailer.,0
Dont get me started. ,0
Back to the hotel.,0
"Cabs to the hotels are a flat $11.00 ,which includes a $1.00 fuel surcharge,.",0
"Canal Street is under repair, as is much of the city, even two years after Katrina.",0
Mostly the sidewalks are being rebuilt.,0
I didnt have a problem with the construction in the city and I came down mainly because NOLa needs support.,0
"Upon arrival at the Marriott, I knew things were not going to be so swell.",0
"First, there were two uniformed associates outside, a doorman and a bellman.",0
"While one opened my door, neither of them got my bags out of the cab, nor did they offer a single female assistance into the hotel.",0
Strike one. ,0
"Upon entering, the entire lobby is under construction, so you have to lug your stuff up an escalator to the temporary lobby on the second floor.",0
Let me explain. ,0
I have no problem with renovations.,0
"BUT, this hotel made NO mention of any renovations on their website.",0
"I checked and double checked, and called Marriotts Platinum desk and asked them to verify that no mention was made.",0
"Actually, I was one day early but since the hotel was about 17% occupied, it wasnt a problem.",0
I was given a room in the river tower with a view of the other tower and pool.,0
The pools are closed for repair.,0
"Again, I was not informed of this in advance, nor at check-in",0
"The Concierge lounge, access to which I receive due to my frequency of Marriott-branded use, was across the hotel resulting in a trip down the elevator, across the lobby and back up.",0
"Oh well, A side note about the elevators.",0
"Marriott seems to be adding fancy, high speed elevators to its large hotels.",0
The first I saw this was at the Marriott Marquis in NYC.,0
You enter your desired floor on the keypad OUTSIDE the elevator.,0
"Then, the display returns the number/letter of the car which will take you to your floor.",0
"So, make sure you pay attention",1
The room was small with no view.,0
The room was very noisy.,0
I was told that all windows are being replaced with double-paned glass.,0
"Honestly, you can hear people whistling at other people on the street.",0
"Also, construction on the street starts at about 6:30 AM so forget about sleeping in.",0
"Again, I was up early and I dont have a problem with rebuilding.",0
I took a walk through the hotel.,0
"Frankly, most of the associates didnt acknowledge anyones presence.",0
The sole person who convinced me to not leave was one of the security guards.,0
She took it upon herself to escort me to the front desk for a room change.,0
"I was informed by several associates and managers that the owners of the hotel , it is my understanding that Marriott owns the people but others own the building, refused to inform guests of the renovations.",0
"This is inconceivable, especially given that the rate was $30 more per night than at the JW Marriott across the street and that property is completely renovated",0
I was upgraded to a two room suite.,0
Actually a standard room with a connecting door into a parlor room.,0
The living space was quite nice.,0
"I had two bathrooms, a dining area, couch, wet bar and there is a Murphy bed in the living room so I suppose it would be great for families, or to sell if the place is sold out.",0
Not likely any time soon.,0
The food and service in the concierge lounge wasnt great.,0
"OK, the first night, everything was seafood which I dont eat.",0
Others may love it.,0
"There were mini crab cakes, shrimp and a big pot of gumbo.",0
"Problem is, the fishy smell overpowered the lounge, and the elevator landing outside.",0
Fish shouldnt smell fishy or like garbage.,0
"Also, for breakfast, the food was OK but there were no English Muffins, minimal pastries and cereals and just not a big selection.",0
"It looked nice, whatever there was of it.",0
"However, when I went to get butter balls for my toast, a piece of glass about 1 inch square was commingled with the butter and landed on my toast.",0
I had to go into the little kitchen to find someone to show.,0
"Her response was, oh Ill take care of it.",0
"Not Im sorry or some other words of concern, just Oh.",0
"Needless to say, breakfast that day, and each subsequent day was cafe au lait and beignets at Cafe du Monde.  YUM",0
The restaurant is temporarily located on the 41st floor in what was the fine-dining restaurant pre-Katrina.,0
"There are a couple sandwiches, some entrees including fish and steak, and appetizers.",0
"But, dessert-wise, they had cheesecake, chocolate cake and ice cream.",0
"The turkey club was good, albeit served just on run-of-the-mill white bread, not the advertised sourdough.",0
"When I saw that on the bar menu the second night, I asked the bartender.",0
She said never in 20 years has it been on sourdough,0
Prices in the restaurant were reasonable for New Orleans.,0
"Typical hotel prices, although room service is around $2.00 per item more than the dining room, plus a 21% service charge and tax.",0
"Thats a little too much if you ask me; overall, the city is still almost empty which is a shame.",0
I havent been here for some 20 years and I dont recall too much.,0
The French Quarter is indecent shape but there are a lot of vacant buildings.,0
"Also, while I remember lots of bars, I didnt remember seeing as many of the, hmm, adult-type places as I did this time.",0
"In conclusion, New Orleans needs support.",0
"It still can be a charming city again and I am sure that new developments ,I saw a big TRUMP banner on the cab ride over, will help.",0
My problems werent with the city. ,0
Most of the people I encountered outside of the hotel were very nice.,0
80% of the people IN the hotel couldnt care less about whether guests are there.,0
"When I went to the desk to hand in my certificate, both the associate and manager told me I had to call in advance and that the certificate ,a print out from the Marriott Rewards Platinum page that says PRINT THIS PAGE AND SURRENDER, was no good since it wasnt the certificate.",0
"Frankly I still dont know what they were saying, aside from implying that I am an idiot.",0
"So, after only 2 nights, I lugged my stuff down the escalator with no help, across the street and checked into the JW a day early.",0
"Out of all the associates I encountered, only two- a female security guard and the aforementioned bartender, were nice.",0
I just recently stayed at the Paradisus Palma Real,0
You will not want to leave.,0
The resort is about 25 minutes away from the airport.,0
Its a very quick ride.,0
When you arrive at the resort the bell man takes your luggage and you proceed to check in.,0
At check in the ask you what drink you want and they get it for you.,0
You get a nice cold towel also.,0
We got into our room at 3pm the bell man took our luggage and drove us to our room in the golf cart.,0
We had a Luxury Jacuzzi Gardenview Ste.....The best room ever.,0
The only thing that would be better would be Oceanview.,0
"We had a beautiful kitchen, with a nice table and livingroom with a balcony, and also a flat panel TV, and huge bedroom with a King bed, and also another flat panel TV.",0
The bathroom was amazing.,0
It had a 2 person jacuzzi.,0
The shower is a european shower which you will need to get the sand out of all the places.,0
The pool is amazingly HUGE.,0
It has beds in the pool in the shade and also in the sun.,0
It has a nice swimup bar where the bar tenders are amazing.,0
they will make any drink you want them too.,0
Now my favorite part of course is the food.,0
I have been to Punta Cana 3 times and hands down the food at this resort has got to be the BEST.,0
At the other resorts you bite into a burger your not really sure what kind of meat it is.,0
This resort you know your eating beef.,0
Everything is cooked well��_��__ it tastes like American food.,0
We only ate at Passions and the food was soo good.,0
The buffets has soo many choices of food.,0
"The beach...... the sand is white the water is crystal clear and warm, and nice blue color.",0
There is a lot of sea weed.,0
If you go over by the to the left of the resort by the shops there is less sea weed.,1
If you do want to do any shopping like I said before to the left of the resort there is about 10 little shops.,1
They try there best to sell you anything.,0
If you dont want anything just say no and they leave you alone.,1
If they offer you something that is expensive just bargain with them and start walking out of the store and they will bargain with you.,1
At the resort there is photo studio.,0
"Its $8 per page, they take about 40 pictures and you pay for what you want.",0
And they are good photos.,0
If you have any questions just e-mail me: Jillanson@excite.com,1
"Excellent Hotel Lovely hotel, quiet location just off la Ramblas.",0
Efficient and friendly staff.,0
Spotlessly clean.,0
The only winners are part of the gang themselves ,0
wonderful wedding my husband and i had planned to get married abroad.,0
when we saw secrets excellence at punta cana we instantly fell in love.,0
"we paid extra for the wedding package, room upgrade and the excellence club, it was money well spent.",0
"the hotel, and its staff were brilliant and could not do enough for you.",0
"as we had paid for the excellence club we were whisked away on arrival and taken to an air- conditioned room , which we both welcomed being from Scotland, and were given a glass of bubbly.",0
this was a lovely start to the holiday.,0
"as for the wedding we met the wedding co-ordinator, Iveilesse, the following day and she covered every aspect of the wedding planning and more",0
we took our parent with us and we all truly relaxed and enjoyed every moment.,0
the staff cant do enough for you and are so polite.,0
make sure you have plenty of $1 bills or 50/100 peso notes the really do deserve their tips.,1
"the hotel and the rooms were imaculate, ohh and what a room.",0
it was that good were are going to book into one of the other secret resorts for next summer,0
"Efficient, No frills",0
"Decided at 1am one night to visit Paris for a couple of days, searched and booked 10hrs later through boookings, finding a room ready and just sufficient to sleep a family of 4 with 2 children under 5 a few hours later.",0
Even though the initial request for extra bedding wasnt made very clearly we were accommodated and looked after properly.,0
"Should you be driving: Reasonably well located, near to the outer peripheral road , just watch out which exit you take from Place de Nation...,.",1
"Parking at the park house Picpus recommended , 10min walk away from hotel.",1
"The hotel itself was interesting since it is round, the staff were polite but the hotel itself is understaffed.",0
The breakfast was yukky.,0
The price was ok but after staying- I would expect that the rates should be lowered.,0
The neighborhood was marginal��_��__ must not be far from a landfill- the stink was terrible,0
"Dont let the price fool you- its better to spend a few extra bucks for cleanliness, a walkable neighborhood without someone asking you for money or cigarettes or whatever they may be looking for.",1
"The dead mouse outside the front door didnt help- nor did the refuse container outside the front door ,it was not emptied the entire time we were there-overfull with food, butts, styrofoam cups, etc and smelled horrible,.",0
I wish the staff well but the rest of it was terrible.,0
Never again.,0
"Great owners, service, location",0
Just got back from our vacation in Italy in which we stayed three nights at this hotel.,0
We paid 118 Euro a night for a double room in this hotel and were pleased.,0
"Its right down the block from the train station, which is very helpful for lugging your luggage.",0
The room was fine.,0
"Nothing special, but it was clean, big enough for two and decent private bathroom.",0
"The breakfast was good - cake, bread, cereal, OJ and coffees.",0
"The owners and receptionists spoke English and were very, very nice and accommodating - helped us with directions and book reservations at museums, etc.",0
Internet was one euro every 15 minutes.,0
Location is not bustling - but it is close to everything.,0
"10 minute walk to museum where the david is, 10 minute walk to duomo, 20 minute walk to uffizi and most other nice parts.",0
we were very pleased.,0
"old fashioned, but still my favorite...",0
Fantastic location in the middle of East-Berlin at the corner of two historic streets.,0
"The hotel was build in the Eastern Germany Days, but its renovated in most parts.",0
"I was here many times before and have seen all kind of rooms , make sure, you get an renovated one with Heavenly Bed,.",1
"Due to my SPG Platinum Status, this time I had a corner suite with a great view, but it was a old interior...",0
"Beside the location the best thing is the atrium lobby ... very old fashioned, but a great spot My favorite hotel in Berlin",0
I stayed here regularly for work for about 2 months this year.,0
This is one of the nicest hotels in the Dallas/Ft.,0
Worth area.,0
Its really one of the nicest hotels anywhere and the best airport hotel.,0
The rooms are very nice and clean.,0
The amenities are great.,0
The service is first class.,0
The in-room dining is excellent.,0
"And the rooms must be well insulated, because I did not ever notice any jet engine noise.",0
"The only downside , or upside depending on how you look at it, is: This isnt a trendy hotel, like some in Dallas.",0
"So if you want nightlife, you need to drive to it.",1
We did not want to leave.,0
"They knew my name when I got out of the cab, which was wild, and the intro/check in/walk through was very cool indeed",0
Room was spacious with giant TV and bathroom.,0
The mirrors even made you look better,0
Breakfast in bed was delicious and elegant.,0
"I cant go into everything in detail, but EVERYTHING was great Want to go back ASAP",0
"Business oriented, and highly recommeded for that purpose",1
"Well, havent stayed in Four Seasons or Peninsula so hard to compare those clearly spectacular venues.",0
"But this place delivers for all intents and purposes, no doubt.",0
Excellent customer care and the quality and response time for room service is commendable.,0
"Got upgraded to a suite overlooking Victoria Peak, an understandable gesture considering we book all our corporate guests through this place but still appreciated.",0
"Abit impersonal though, so if you are looking for a place remembering your name Conrad isnt the first place to look, on most important points it clearly delivers.",1
quite adequate for the price,0
The hotel is perfect for business travellers.,0
But if you are on holiday there are sum negatives.,1
"Rooms are tiny and the housekeeping isnt there after 1pm, so if u came back late and wanted to sleep in ur room wont get cleaned that day.",0
"Also, i stayed for 4 nights and the breakfast kind of gets repititive after 2 days.",0
"But then for the price, 67euros a night, i guess it was to be expected.",0
The staff though is nice and friendly.,0
They have a small bar which serves drinks at a reasonable price.,0
The location is quite good.,0
The rooms are clean with windows that open.,0
All in all if price is an issue stay here.,0
Trapped in Paradise,0
"The beach and the hotel lobby was beautiful however, the room left a lot to be desired.",0
My husband and I received a gift to go for our honeymoon.,0
We were excited to be alone in what was described as paradise little did we know we would have been better off staying at home.,0
The hotel was briefed ahead of time that we would be spending our honeymoon with them.,0
Our room was decorated with love birds made of towels and we received a small bottle of room.,0
"The bedding situation consisted of two twin size beds that we tried to put together but, one was higher than the other, some way to consummate a marriage?",0
The water pressure was horrible and the jets did not work.,0
Items that were served for dinner the night before reappeared for lunch with a sauce on it.,0
The food smelled spoiled most of the time.,0
To think we had to pay a mandatory $76 per day per person for that slop.,0
"At the hotel there are two restaurants available by reservation, we decided to reserve a table in the seafood restaurant; the menu was very limited and only contain one fish dish ,the other dishes were chicken or beef,.",0
If you wanted lobster or shrimp you had to pay an additional $27.00.,0
If you are a drinker you will feel like you died and went to heaven; one can drink the day away with many choices and the $76.00 will feel like a bargain.,1
For us it was a week in hell.,0
"The hotel staff that peddled excursions harassed you in the hotel, on the grounds and on the beach constantly.",0
Once they realized that we were from America the price tripled for an average three hour excursion.,0
"Take our advice, stay at home, save your money if this is where you plan to vacation.",1
"just ok The hotel had nice grounds, and some nice art.",0
What I had a problem with was the rooms had thin walls.,0
"I was given a room with connecting doors, when i went down and asked for an alternate room without connecting doors, I was told that 90 percent of the hotel had connecting doors.",0
Well I think that only added to the noise problem.,0
"Our neighbors phone rang and we could here his conversation, and the toilets flushing.",0
I would not recommend this if you want a good nights sleep.,1
wonderful wonderful hotel.,0
"All it was promised to be, rooms were spacious, beds were great.",0
The workout room had 2 elliptical trainers as well as a few other machines.,0
Location is perfect neww the cable cars.,0
Good sushi restaurant around the corner and a starbucks nearby,0
"Nice but expensive hotel, shame about the location",0
We stayed atthe Melia Bali for the first five nights of our honeymoon this summer.,0
"The hotel was nice enough - beautiful gardens, lovely pool, nice rooms ,but annoyingly damp - all the bedding smelled damp which was very unplesant,, but Nusa Dua itself was a dreadful disappointment.",0
"The hotels there could have been anywhere in the world, only the fact that the word Bali appeared on signs gave you any hint as to where you were.",0
"The resort is gated, no local people live there, they only come there to work.",0
"A simple nasi goreng was charged at 95000 rupiah in the hotel, and around 22000 everywhere else.",0
Fantastic Value on Waikiki,0
We spent 5 days at this hotel in August 2007 and will be looking no further when we return to Honolulu.,0
"The hotel is quite small for Waikiki and some rooms are a little dated ,because the hotel is being renovated,.",0
It doesnt have a swimming pool or a restaurant but wed actually call this an advantage.,0
"With Waikiki Beach right on your doorstep and so many alternatives for evening entertainment, who wants to spend all their time in the hotel any way ?",0
The location is simply perfect and the staff must be among the friendliest and most helpful we have ever come across.,0
They do everything to help you enjoy your stay.,0
The desk staff are great but if you need anything special ask for Leonor who will go out of her way to get what you need.,0
We looked around at some alternatives but we reckon this is the best value hotel on the beach front and cannot recommend it highly enough.,0
"Some good, some bad",0
Stayed at the Barcelo Dominican Beach from Dec. 8 to 15 and had a pretty good time.,0
"I had read many complaints on this site, and though I saw many negative ones, I figured no matter what I would keep a positive outlook.",0
"RoomHad to wait about an hour to check in, but they let us go to lunch while we waited as we got there at about 2 p.m. ,check in at 3 usually,.",0
"Once we got our keys, we headed off to our section.",0
"I was hoping for something decent, and at first look I could not complain.",0
"We were in Block 6 ,Elite Club section, and were treated to an oceanview room on the first floor.",0
We were quite surprised since we hadnt made any special requests and were just supposed to get a standard room.,0
"It had a king sized bed, a separate day bed in the tv area and a huge bathroom with shower and separate jacuzzi tub.",0
We were essentially a 10 second walk from the beach,0
"Though we were quite pleased with the room, it did show some wear... peeling paint, a few mold spots near the patio door, and more mold on a few of the cushions on the day bed.",0
It was extremely humid so I imagine its quite difficult for things to dry properly there... hence the mold.,0
"Other than that, we had a mini bar stocked with beer, pop and water ,left the maid $5 the first day and asked for additional water - she kept us fully supplied with the latter,.",0
"My bf tried the tub, which he very much enjoyed.",0
"That said, our upstairs neighbours also tried theirs and it leaked into our bathroom.",0
"It wasnt the end of the world since the water dripped into our tub, but it was a bit alarming that the water was coming from a light fixture in the ceiling",0
"Ah well, we just kept the light closed and laughed it off",0
Everything else in the room was fine.,0
Beach Absolutely beautiful,0
"It was a bit small compared to other resorts Ive stayed at in Cuba and Mexico, but the water was pristine.",0
There were also plenty of chairs for everyone.,0
FoodIm not really picky so I thought the food was fine as did my bf.,0
"I was a little disappointed at the variety of fruit for the most part, but I always found something yummy to try at the buffet.",0
"I also tried the Spanish, Italian, Japanese and Brasilian restaurants.",0
"For meat lovers, I would highly recommend the Brasilian.",1
"Apparently the service can be a bit slow, but we were very well served there.",0
"You go to a mini buffet first for your side dishes and the servers bring you cuts of meat ,shish kabob style, directly to your table.",0
"My next favorite was the Spanish, which had great selection and atmosphere ,note that the drawback to the Brasilian was the LACK of atmosphere - no music, glaring lights,.",0
I also enjoyed the Japanese where the cook prepared the food in front of you and does a little show off routine.,0
"Right off the bat, ours got so carried away and the salt shaker smashed into my water glass spraying shards in my sushi.",0
Something else I laughed off... they just brought me another plate of sushi.,0
"The main course was tasty, but I found the sushi wasnt extremely fresh.",0
I ordered risotto with mushroom with slivers of parmesan.,0
I was served a bowl of RICE drowning in a watery cream sauce with parmesan and canned mushrooms.,0
"If you cant make an italian meal, dont advertise you can",0
Service..No complaints here.,0
"The lobby bar was a bit slow in the evening unless you asked for rum and coke, pina colada or beer.",0
"I tried ordering something from their menu and gave up after repeating my order four times ,I was at the bar 10 minutes,.",0
All other spots were great.,0
Awesome coffee shop you have to try too.,0
The place also offers massages in little huts by the pool and beach.,0
"I skipped out, but only because we ran out of time.",0
"PoolsThree on site, but one was closed for repairs at the far end of the resort.",0
The others were nice and clean... especially liked the one with the pool bar,0
"But for $875 taxes in, you cant complain too much.",0
"Some of the people who were travelling with the same supplier were really negative ,one even complained about the wind being too loud and needing ear plugs,,",0
"so I think when you read these reviews, you have to take into consideration that everyone sees things differently.",0
The resort was just bought by the Barcelo group and has been branded a four star.,0
It is definately not a four star.,0
"When it was under the old name of Ocean Beach, it was considered a three star.",0
"Obviously, itll take more than two months to get to the four star level.",0
"The place has a lot of potential, so I think that once they actually start renovating the rooms it will be a great place.",0
Can one have a good time here and enjoy their stay as the resort is now?,0
I think so - just keep an open mind and remember that the mentality is very different from what you may be used to.,1
"We enjoyed our vacation, but we have stayed at several Gran Bahia hotels befor and found it allitle blaw as we knew what to expect.",0
"Flight was long, and there was not much direction as to how to get to the bus.Food was great.",0
"Room was excellent, we requested to be close to the beach so we were abit far away from everything else.",0
Service was excellent.,0
Only neg was no one served drinks at the pool.,0
Our friends book at the priemer and had a private pool and resturant.,0
We did not so I would book priemer next time.,0
Beach - We enjoyed it but we like diving and this is not a good beach for this.,0
"We went to a shop ran by someone from Montreal, it is free to go..",0
"not a good place to get presents very costly, but nice.",0
The tents at the end of the beach has nice gifts at good prices.,0
Very Good Royal...,0
Spent three nights at the Royal Ramblas in May.,0
We found the hotel on Tripadvisor and advised our travel agent to book.,0
We could not have picked a better location.,0
"Right at the Northern end of this legendary boulevard, access to the Gothic center, the best artisan and designer shopping plus the central produce market, is all within a ten-minute walk The hotel was mostly good.",0
We felt that the room was a little small but was kept scupriously clean.,0
We especially liked the tortilla.,0
Not many hotel kitchens offered food form the region for breakfast during the tour.,0
A tip for eating in Barcelona - be wary of any of the restaurants on the Ramblas itself.,0
Much better option is to venture a little into the side streets.,1
You do not have to go far to experience excellent offerings.,0
lots of fresh fruit salads and juices plus all the Jamon and olives you can eat.,0
Overall a very good hotel and efficient front desk staff who had good English speaking skills.,0
"Good clean rooms, breakfasts were more than ample and served well.",0
"However, while the staff as a whole was great, there was a man on the desk ,name forgotten, that was condescending and a bit arrogant.",0
We felt as though we shouldnt be asking ANY questions....We would still recommend this hotel,0
"Dave and Maxine Johnson Maine,USA",0
Hardly 4-star I stayed at this hotel while on a business trip.,0
"True, the location is very convenient to the central shopping district and the staff are mostly courteous.",0
"But, they seem to have only one person on reception and one on bell duty at any given time, including prime check-in/check-out times.",0
it is a very noisy hotel -- do NOT get a room in the upper 20s.,0
Not only will you hear every flush your neighbor makes but also a tremendous amount of street noise.I have no idea how this hotel secured a 4-star rating.,0
"Some of the lack of amenities in the $450/night junior suite in which I stayed:No ironing boardNo pants hangersVery few tissues ,a small package of 4,A 1x1 bar of soapNo face washclothsOne English channel on TVNo alarm clockNo secured Wi-Fi and have to get new username/pswd each day",0
Nice Hotel I just got back from a conference in San Francisco.,0
"My colleagues and I stayed all over the Union Square area, and my experience at the Bijou was the most positive of our group who tried the botique hotels.",0
The hotel was extremely clean and well kept.,0
"I am very particular about this kind of thing, and have spent a lot of time at other hotels asking to be moved. Not here.",0
"The room was small ,which I expected,, but nicely appointed and very clean.",0
Even the bathroom sparkled.,0
This might have been the only hotel Ive ever stayed at where housekeeping didnt rudely wake me up at 8am.,0
The housekeeping staff was very thoughtful about when they cleaned the rooms and they did a great job.,0
The front desk staff was really friendly and knew a lot about the city.,0
"The only downside of the hotel is that our room faced the side stree ,Eddy?,",0
which housed both an all night liquor store and an all night all male theatre.,0
"In theory thats not a problem, but the reality was the noise from the street was pretty bad.",0
I wore earplugs but still had trouble getting any sleep.,0
Id suggest staying at this hotel but requesting a room that faces the main street and/or stay on the top floor.,1
"Or just buy better earplugs than I had :,",0
"Fantastic, Fabulous, just perfect",0
"How can you go back to the ranch when you been to Paris, or to be exact the George V Four Seasons Hotel.",0
"It is true, you have to see it to believe it.The room was spacious, beautiful arrangements of fresh flowers everywhere in the hotel, and the staff was always gracious.",0
My husband and my nine year old son enjoyed the indoor pool just before going out to dinner.,0
It is truly one of the best hotels in the world.,0
Great Hotel in Good Location,0
We have just returned from four night stay at the SoHo from our friends wedding.,0
"We were lucky enough to be able to book the Romantic Package so got upgraded to terrace room, breakfast and one evening meal included and cava and chocolates on arrival.",0
"The reception staff and cleaners were really friendly and helpful, all spoke excellent English which was helpful as our Catalan was pitiful.",0
"The room was great, huge bed, lovely terrace overlooking the Gran Via, huge tv and lovely bathroom.",0
Breakfast was on until 11 every morning and had a great selection from scrambled eggs to pastries.,0
We really enjoyed our stay here and would definitely stay again.,0
On arrival we were upgraded to one of the Garden Villas.,0
"This was situated in its own walled garden with water on 2 sides and a bath leading from the bathroom, surrounded by water.",0
The location of the hotel is very spectacular surrounded by rice terraces and overlooking a river gorge.,0
The staff are very attentive and the service was very good.,0
If you have time take the morning trek with lunch.,1
You will go out with a guide and experience the countryside at close quarters.,0
The lunch is taken on the rice terraces and staff come from the hotel to prepare it for you.One word of warning our party occupied 2 rooms and both rooms had small items disappear from them during our stay.,0
"These were not of a great monitory value, but spoilt what was overall a very good experience.",0
"With this in mind, it may sway us from visiting this property again, which is a great shame as otherwise our experience was faultless.",0
Stay Away....Far Away,0
This hotel was expected to be top notch...but WAS NOT....as a diamond member status we had to wait 2 hours in the lobby until the room was ready...was upgraded to an ocean view room....but the rooms ARE THE SIZE OF A BIG CLOSET ,0
"Unusual ,and Very Good, Experience",0
"I stayed at Hotel Max for 9 days during a conference in early June, and it was an extremely good value.",0
"The reason I chose this hotel was primarily price, and location within easy walking distance of the convention center.",0
"For the price, I dont think there is a better hotel in downtown Seattle.",0
"The hotel had fun modern decor, and the staff were very friendly, intelligent, helpful, and uniformly young ,nearly all under 40 years,.",0
"The rooms are quite small, ,although not all the same size for doubles,, and the room was clean.",0
"The beds were extremely comfortable, and the rooms surprisingly quiet.",0
"The bathroom was clean, and so modern that at first I could not figure out how to drain the sink ,I thought it was malfunctioning,, but a quick visit from maintenance showed I just wasnt hip enough to figure it out.",0
One bad thing was that our shower curtain smelled of mildew.,0
"Some helpful and **FREE** amenities of the hotel include a very nice business center, and a small, well equipped gym on the second floor.",0
"The business center has a couple computers and even a printer for guests ,internet service in rooms requires an extra fee,.",0
The gym has several quite fancy treadmills and some free weights.,0
"The staff was also very flexible about splitting our bill several ways ,I was sharing a double room with two other people,.",0
"My only complaint was that one night the television stopped working for no apparent reason, and the maintenance man was unable to fix it.",0
"It eventually started working again, also for no obvious reason, so I never figured out what was wrong.",0
"We ate in the attached bar Red Fin, and the food and wine were very tasty.",0
"The hotel has a nice location within walking distance from the convention center, space needle, waterfront, and Pike Place Market.",0
Dont miss the nearby Palace Kitchen Restaurant and the doughnut shop that are on 5th Avenue.,1
Both are yummy.,0
The pool was the highlight,0
My hubby and I just returned from a 1 week stay at the Majestic.,0
We travelled with Sunwing Vacations out of Toronto.,0
"Overall, we had a great time.",0
"This is most definately a RELAXING vacation, which I found to be a bit difficult to do at times.",0
"This was our 1st all inclusive vacation as we usually go on cruises ,Royal Caribbean,.",0
"Due to the fact that we are experienced cruisers, an all inclusive vacation had alot to live up to.",0
The Majestic did not disappoint in most areas.,0
The regular junior suites are amazing.,0
I did ask before hand to have a room in building #2 overlooking the pool.,0
After arriving we were put in building #3.,0
I asked to switch rooms and they did give me a bit of a hard time saying I did have a pool view.,0
But building #2 is so much closer to the pool they eventually switched us.,0
One thing you must ask for when checking in is a Majestic Passport.,1
I cant understand why they dont just hand these out to visitors.,0
"Otherwise you have no way of knowing what the restaurant hours are, rules about the towels, housekeeping number to call, etc.",0
There is absolutely no information in your room about anything to do with the resort.,0
"That was a bid frustrating, but luckily we had the passport.",0
Food is mostly where the Majestic loses 1 star.,0
The food doesnt even compare to cruise food.,0
"If you havent cruised before, then youd probably think the food was pretty good.",0
"The Supreme buffet is pretty good for breakfast, but many items are cold.",0
I always got my eggs or omleets prepared by the cook to ensure they were fresh.,0
The crepes were my favourite part of breakfast.,0
Lunch at the Beach buffet was OK.,0
Not alot to choose from.,0
We would have done better to eat at the Supreme buffet but we were always wet from the ocean/pool.,0
"For dinner we tried the Japaneese, Le Gourmet, Rodeo Steakhouse and main buffet.",0
The Japaneese wasnt as fun as I was hoping for.,0
"Perhaps our table was a bit on the boring side, but the cook didnt even ineract with us.",0
Le Gourmet was good.,0
It was nice to finally eat at a restaurant that wasnt buffet.,0
I probably enjoyed the main buffet the best just for the variety.,0
I found at all places they tend to cook with ALOT of oils and salt.,0
There is no way I could stay beyond 1 week at the Majestic as the food choices were getting quite boring and routine after a few days.,0
We never got sick thank goodness.,0
We visited the Bahia Principe next door and were VERY glad we chose the Majestic as their layout is much more preferred.,0
The pool is incredible and the ocean was fantastic.,0
The resort couldnt have been more than 50% full so there was always a shady spot to sit.,0
The entertainment crew did a great job.,0
They had so much energy,0
Due to the comfy chairs I usually fell asleep.,0
The Marinium tour where you snorkel with sharks/stingrays. ,0
The sharks were much bigger than I was expecting.,0
If we were to go back to the Dominican I think we would stay there agin.,0
I cant imagine a more beautiful resort or more helpful staff.,0
The food is just part of the deal and it has to be expected to be a bit lower quality compared to cruise ships.,0
Lovely Small Hotel,0
"Just stayed 2 nights recently, hardly stayed in the room as we walked all around the Old and New French Quarter area.",0
"Live music, shops food.",0
I was surprised as one morning there was a wedding by the pool and the day before I saw a wedding too.,0
The French Quarter is now full of people getting married by some Dr. Jerry in New Orleans.,0
I liked the hotel as it was close to all that I wanted to see and do.,0
Nice staff too.,0
We stayed in room 408 and it was great.,0
Everything was SO CLEAN and SO NEW and SO WELL DONE,0
I loved the sliding bathroom door and the beds were very comfy and so were the pillows and bedding.,0
Im turning GREEN so knowing I was helping give back was also a HUGE plus,0
Id stay there everytime,0
Do beware that a soda at the bar will cost you $3.56 before tip,1
A bit pricey for a can of Sprite.,0
Very convienent to everything.,0
"The Cafe across the street, Cade De le Presse is delicous Order the french toast",0
My husband and myself enjoyed this wonderful resort from July 19 thru July 28th.,0
The Staff was great and so was the service.,0
You cannot encounter a problem that could not be fixed.,0
"The Spa was top notch, the restaurants were basically the same as any other resort actually better i.e. Sandals, etc.",0
If you want to have the most relaxing and wonderful vacation ever come to Secrets,1
you wont be disappointed.,0
"Great location, cost effective",0
Hotel is down some side streets 5 minute walk away from the main street of La Rambla with its metro stop of Liceu - so you are within easy reach of the rest of the City via the metro.,1
Location wise the hotel is great but during the night the side streets were a little daunting and saw a girl get her bag snatched ,0
just keep your wits about you and you will have no problems.,1
There are lots of lovely local bars and cafes near the hotel ?,0
much better value that those of on La Rambla ?,0
found lovely tapas bars and ate with the locals.,0
Found one bar just down the street taking a right out of the hotel which was a good night and one lovely one set in the walled garden area found by walking out of the hotel taking a left and left again and there is a large wall opposite ,0
go through the large gate and to the left is a lovely little outside bar area ___��_��___?,1
kind of set in a walled garden area.,0
Would advise taking a stroll in the opposite direction to La Rambla and exploring the area were you will stumble across the most wonderful bars and restaurants at much better value.,1
"Took a room on the fourth floor, room was nice and clean, laminate floors throughout and a wonderfully powerful shower, plasma TV",0
only downside was that the laminate floors meant that when the cleaners came round in the morning the noise from the corridor was greatly amplified.,0
"Found the staff helpful and the taxi drivers knew where the hotel was, so no trouble finding it.",0
"Over all I think I would stay here again, location was great and for the price the standard of furnishings and quality was top notch",0
would recommend.,1
We were pleasantly surprised when we were upgraded from the Beach Resort to the Palace.,0
"All in all, the complex is nice, the beaches are wonderful and the food is pretty good.",0
"One word of caution - drink lots of bottled water and watch the food preparation, making sure your food has been cooked all the way.",1
We found the staff to be friendly and plenty of activities for everyone in our group to enjoy.,0
A Fine Establishment,0
We stayed in this hotel for one night in October 2006 and found it to be excellent.,0
"It is nicely decorated, clean and comfortable and the staff were extremely polite and helpful.",0
"The concierge brought out a tourist map and in no time had gone through the attractions with us, along with how to navigate the metro.",0
"Its not in the prettiest part of town, but the area is quite safe and is abviously being redeveloped with trendy apartments.",0
"Overall, an excellent choice",0
Other reviewers have said what we would like to say.,0
"For the length of stay, I would have appreciated the hotel to have offered the best rate, and been able to amend when we arrived.",0
So dont always think that booking early is the best.,1
"But it hasnt put me off the place, and it will definitley be our choice of hotel when we return, which I hope will not be too far away",0
Very good experience,0
"Just stayed night of 14th November 2006, got a very good rate including buffet breakfast from Hotel.com",0
"Beware - If paying the buffet breakfast was poor value, Ok for cereals and fruit,poor quality cooked breakfast.",1
Great hotel with great Staff,0
"Theres a complimentary breakfast, and I was able to use a courtesy room to shower before my flight.",0
My room had a great view of the Ala Wai Canal.,0
"While not on the beach, I think a lot of travellers put too much emphasis on needing to be beachfront in Waikiki.",0
Waikiki is small and you can walk to the beach in a short time.,1
"I really enjoyed my stay here,",0
We just got back from teh Royal Sonesta.,0
I must say the location in superb.,0
"However, be prepared that most restaurants and hotels are working at half of their usual staff since Katrina.",1
You will have to wait in lines to check in and will never see anyone greeting you at the door.,0
One poor bellman for the hotel the whole time we were there.,0
"Eubanks, the bellman was wonderful",0
Made an excellent recommendation or dinner-Tommys...you have to eat there,1
Say hello to him-their best employee,0
Hotel is beautiful but rooms are a little outdated.,0
Stay in courtyard room-very quiet.,1
Overall a good expereience.,0
Location is worth the other hassles of the hotel.,0
Go to Spa Aria at tehhOtel MOnteleone...wonderful services there Eat at Muriels and Tommys You wont be disappointed,1
"Great location, fantastic staff",0
Luckily there was a spot around the corner.,0
"The valet met me at the door, let me in, and was very pleasant.",0
It was also pretty cold.,0
"Otherwise, it was nicely decorated and cozy.",0
The iPod-dockable clock radio was on and softly playing some classical music.,0
"Because I am an inTouch member, a gift of a bottle of water and a bar of chocolate were waiting for me on the nightstand.",0
Another pair of chocolates lay on the pillow.,0
I thought that was a nice touch.,0
I turned on the heat and the room was at a comfortable temperature by the time I had finished unpacking.,0
The bed was extremely comfortable.,0
The room was very clean.,0
The shower was hot and the water pressure strong.,0
The bathroom amenities were LOccitane.,0
The only lapse in the otherwise excellent service was at breakfast the following morning.,0
I had been given vouchers for a continental breakfast at check-in.,0
I was hungry for a bit more than that and ordered eggs and sausage.,0
The waiter brought eggs and bacon instead.,0
"When I pointed out the mistake, he returned with sausage, then disappeared.",0
I had to flag down the hostess in order to get my check.,0
The food was excellent.,0
"With that sole exception, the service was every bit as good as Ive come to expect from the Kimpton brand.",0
"Thanks to a busy work schedule, I did not get to spend much time in the area around the hotel.",0
"From what I saw while driving, the neighborhood is very picturesque.",0
Dont hesitate to stay here unless you are upper class American and only expect the very very best.,1
For the price you pay this resort is awesome.,0
I have been to Punta Cana before and stayed at a Riu resort which was nice but I liked this much better.,0
I am from middle class america and I was very satisfied.,0
I went with my daughter and my 2 grandsons.,0
They had a blast.,0
It kills me when people put in these reviews about no hot water and a long check in etc.,0
You are in another country people.,0
They dont have water systems like we do.,0
If you expect 5 star service then dont leave your country where you have all the modern facilities.,1
We only had to take a cold shower one day and it gave us a good laugh.,0
Check in couldnt have been any smoother.,0
We arrived at noon and were in our room at 1.,0
"Food was great, pool is awesome.",0
"Swim up bar fantastic, beach is beautiful and on and on.",0
So bottom line is if you are an average american like me go to this resort.,1
It is wonderful.,0
email me any questions and I will gladly answer them.,0
And please ignore the negative comments.,1
They are unfounded.,0
LOVED the Hotel Lungarno,0
My husband and I spent 5 days in Florence and 5 in Rome for our honeymoon and I really belabored over picking some good hotels.,0
"I studied in Florence, so the pressure was on.",0
I struck gold with the Hotel Lungarno.,0
It was fantastic.,0
The location is PERFECT.,0
The room was a great room - had a balcony and view of the Boboli Gardens and the Uffizi.,0
They upgraded us for free.,0
It was a great boutique hotel that had the personal feel that I was looking for.,0
The lounge area overlooking the Arno was a great place to relax at the end of the day and get a few glasses of wine before heading out for dinner.,0
I loved this hotel and would recommend it to anyone.,0
Arrived after a long journey and went to our room on the fourth floor.,0
One of the smallest rooms in any Best Western I have stayed in.,0
"Decore was nice and clean, beds comfortable and we did have a fridge.",0
However window was wide open and was broken.,0
"We asked at front desk and then said they would send someone up in 10 minutes, over 1 hour later no sign so we asked to move rooms.",0
"The concierge was useless, un-helpful and a waste of time.",0
"Told us about a vegaterian restruant that had closed down years ago, a dry cleaners that was also shut.",0
"So we are in our new room, no double glazing and god could you here the traffic.",0
"Dumper trucks, buses etc all from 4am....not much sleep at all.",0
Over rated and over priced.,0
The only good thing was the location.,0
It should be ashamed to call its self a Best Western.,0
"My family, friends and I were attacked and assaulted right in the jacuzzi and the hotel staff did nothing to prevent or stop this until it was too late.",0
Then when it was over and the police came the hotel manager on duty refused to remove the assailants from the property as he said they were victims too when it was apparent these heavily intoxicated people perpetrated the act.,0
"For example, the primary assailant attempted to murder one of my traveling companions as her hair was pulled and head held under water while her husband who shouted sexual obsenities toward us watched.",0
Hyatt failed to take care of us before and after this incident and for that I can never recommend them again.,0
"Very refined Got a great deal on the internet ,40% off advertised rates, and used it as a one night stopover en route back to Heathrow.",0
"Building is impressive ,although dwarfed by surrounding financial HQs and the like, and about a 15 minute cab ride from the airport.",0
Staff are superb throughout the hotel.,0
Our room was a bay view - all fittings were excellent and my wife revelled in the bath.,0
"And the ridiculously overpriced spa where she had a number of treatments, all preceded by the ringing of a small bell.",0
"We ate in the Cafe/restaurant where the food was very good and again, the service top class.",0
If you can get the rate this is a great stopover and the staff have a lot of nice touches like getting us some water for the cab ride back to the airport.,1
"friendly, good value",0
Small hotel near the Ala Moana marina and shopping centre.,0
The inside of the hotel has been recently renovated and is very tasteful.,0
The beds are very comfortable and have more pillows than even I can use,0
"Previous comments have been made about the road noise, which is noticeable, but Im not sure what else to expect on a busy road in a major city.",0
"There are 2 beaches nearby ,10-15min walk, Dukes opposite the Hilton and the lovely Ala Moana beach park on the other side of the Marina.",0
"All the staff were very friendly, especially Rene, and if youre there on a Tuesday theres a nice touch of a drinks reception where management and guests mingle.",0
"Mike, the manager really does seem to be looking for honest opinions and comments for his hotel.",0
"Excellent hotel, superb staff.",0
"I spent 11 nights in the Wyndham Boston, and found it to be an excellent hotel.",0
"Staff were top-notch, and quality of service second to nothing.",0
"Only small gripes would be, no pool and tiny Gym.",0
"Tip-join their members club ,free, via their website before you book, and then you truly get treated royally .i.e upgrade to suites, free calls, free welcome snacks, daily papers etc.",1
Great Location- ok hotel,0
Just returned from a 5 night stay at the waikiki beach hotel.,0
"I booked the room to have a ocean view room, the first room did have a view but mostly of the hotel across the street.",0
Went to speak with reception and they moved me to a better room.,0
Ask for room with an odd number thats starts over 13.,1
Little Gem and close to all you want to see in Madrid,0
This is wonderful hotel-finished to a high standard.,0
"If you dont want to stay in a hi tech hotel ,of which there are many in Madrid, and prefer a bit of old Spain - stay here.",1
The rooms are very comfortable with a beautifully done separate bathroom.,0
We didnt get the metro once.,0
Madrid is fabulous and I hope to return when the weather is warmer.,0
I would recommend this hotel to anyone who likes a bit of style and comfort.,1
The value was brillant- room BB per night was 99euro- a bargain.,0
Ive dont have any photos but I would say that the hotel web site photos do not do this Hotel justice.,0
Also this is a safer area than say- Sol and the Gran Via-where I saw an attempt at pic-pocketing etc at night time.,1
Be careful where you stay in this city.,1
Were glad we stayed on Calle del Prado at this hotel and will stay here again,0
It was delightful - very central to everywhere.,0
The room we stayed in was large and airy and i loved coming back to the room each night to find the bed turned down and two mini toblerones on each pillow.,0
Great customer service,0
"My two sisters and I get together once a year or so to have a fun NYC weekend, and its important for us to stay together.",0
This hotel was the only one in our price range that would guarantee separate beds.,0
"We had a very large room with two queen beds and a large ,and comfortable, sofa bed.",0
The obviously new beds and bedding were super-luxurious.,0
"All of our requests were accommodated ,high floor, refrigerator, extra towels, etc.,",0
My working sister appreciated the free wi-fi.,0
"And most important of all, the service people - front desk, bellmen, restaurant staff, housekeeping - were beyond helpful, cooperative, cheerful and friendly.",0
I highly recommend this hotel for families and/or friends who want to hang out together instead of booking small separate rooms.,1
We will definitely return.,0
Travelled with three children,0
"My three children ages 9, 14, 16 and I stayed at the El Conquistador from Jan 20-25, 2007.",0
We had a one bedroom suite on the fourth floor adjacent to the Golden Door Spa.,0
"Our room was beautiful and spacious and if you can afford it, I highly recommend the bigger room when staying with children.",1
The main entrance to the suite was awe inspiring.,0
We just said WOW.,0
To the left of the open foyer was the bar.,0
"It had a marble countertop, two cushioned bar stools w/ backs, two refrigerators under the sink/countertop.",0
"The dining room had a six seating table, the living room had several wicker chairs w/ cushions a nice sofa and a full sized bed that you pulled out of the wall.",0
The view of the ocean and Palomino Island was breathtaking.,0
"Down the hall was the bathroom with shower, safe and toilet room ,yes the toilet is in its own room,.",0
"The master bedroom had a king sized bed, walk-in closet, master bath with whirlpool, shower and toilet room.",0
It also had a wet bar with mini bar fridge under the sink.,0
"It had a beautiful entertainment cabinet with a tv, dvd player and Sony Playstation.",0
You have to rent the games though.,0
There was a small living room off of the master bedroom with a single pull-out sofa bed with tv the works as well.,0
The suite was beautifully decorated with a sort of Island Pottery Barn look.,0
The food was spectacular at every restauarant we went to.,0
It is VERY expensive though.,0
"Its about $17 for a salad or hamburger and at the restaurants everything is ala carte, ie: $9 for a baked potato.",0
But we did not have one bad meal.,0
The service is also very good.,0
Taking the funicular down to the marina was a bit of a project.,0
You couldnt just walk down and go to the beach.,0
You had to take the funicular down to the marina and wait for the ferry to take you to the private island where the beach was.,0
"The ferry ran every 1/2 hr and only took about 8 minutes to get there, but we just missed the ferry and had to sit and wait for the next one so from the time we left our room it was about 45 minutes until we got to the beach.",0
But when you get there it is worth the wait.,0
We were on vacation and in no hurry to do anything.,0
Once we got to the island it was paradise.,0
"You can rent innertubes or floats ,about $10 for the day each,.",1
"There is also jet skiing, snorkeling, etc.",0
For a fee of course.,0
Dont expect ANYTHING to be included.,1
They charge you for everything.,0
If I had one complaint to make about our stay it would be the problem w/ our shower.,0
We rarely ever had hot water and everytime I called for help they told me theyre having problems with the steam.,0
great little hotel,0
"We were very pleased with the Hotel Andra, which is downtown in the Belltown area.",0
"We had a spacious, well-decorated room.",0
The hotel staff was pleasant and extremely helpful.,0
"Hotel is half dozen blocks from Pike Place market, Seattle Art Museum.",0
"Hotel offered free business center services,computer with internet access and printer,.",0
"The attached restuarant, Lola, served breakfast ,and lunch and dinner, which we did not try,, and seems to be open late.",0
Noisy on Weekend,0
Just spent 5 days at Hilton with wife and two teenagers.,0
Had a room on 9th floor overlooking Coit Tower and the Bay.,0
Good location close to Chinatown and Little Italy.,0
Nice room although small.,0
Staff was friendly although I often had trouble finding someone at the Concierge desk.,0
Biggest complaint was the street noise especially Friday and Saturday nights.,0
"If you do stay there and even if you dont, make sure you have dinner at House of Nanking on Kearny - excellent",1
Loved the Outrigger,0
I just want to say thanks to everyone that write on this site.,0
It was very helpful.,0
Where do I begin.,0
"Well, let me just say that I have a great time at the Outrigger.",0
"It was a very nice, clean hotel.",0
I didn have any problems at all.,0
The location was the best.,0
It was in walking distance to all the major stores and resturant.,0
The staff was very friendly and courteous.,0
The activity desk was very knowledgeable about the activities that you can do.,0
We loved Dukes Resturant.,0
The only thing that I didnt like was the birds that walked freely around the resturant.,0
"If you can, upgrade to an Ocean Front Room",1
We were in room 711.,0
"The hotel was remodeling, but it wasnt a bother at all.",0
I never head anything while staying there.,0
I like that the hotel was offer free vows renewal which we did.,0
We were there for our 2nd anniversary.,0
It was free so we did it.,0
It was nine couples all together.,0
It was a couple who got married just 2 days ago.,0
"I can go on and on about the Outrigger, but I will end it here.",0
"Ok lets start, check in went well, until we found out we had two double beds instead of the king we asked for when we booked the trip back in nov.Not a big deal.",0
"The room was clean, lots of towels ,a/c worked all good there, though it would have been nice to have a newly renovated room like some were, but for the time we spent in the room it wasnt a big deal either.",0
The restaurants were all good.,0
"The pools were very clean, but you had to get up at 5am to put your towel on a loung chair or you wouldnt get one by the pool or under an umbrella.",1
There was some construction going on while we were there it was a little distracting to the eyes.,0
They are building a new casino on site looks like it will be nice and when everthing is done it will look awsome.,0
When complaints were put in about this absolutly nothing was done,0
therefore pretty much ruining our vacation along with many other peoples.,0
Bottom line is I will never return to this resort simply because management did nothing to correct this problem.,0
A t-shirt and a bottle just dont cut it when you spent so much to come and relax,0
Hi everyone by the adult pool,0
All you good people.,0
Modern Comfort at the Clarendon Hotel,0
Hotel staff provided prompt and courteous service to address our every need.,0
The interior decor reflected modern style and charm with four-star comfort.,0
The pool area was a delightfully bright place to cool off on those hot Phoenix days.,0
We highly recommend the Clarendon Hotel and Suites.,1
Wont stay here again,0
I travelled with a friend and stayed at this hotel.,0
We asked for two beds and got one bed and a pull out sofa bed.,0
Im only 54 and my feet hung over the edge of the bed.,0
Also you could feel the springs digging into your back all night long.,0
When we brought this up with the front desk clerk he shrugged his shoulders and said all two bed rooms in this hotel are like that.,0
Thats funny because I saw the maid in another room that had two beds not one bed and a pull out sofa.,0
Breakfast was also a problem.,0
We were to get a free continental breakfast each morning.,0
Just fill out the card with the time slot you wish your breakfast to arrive at your room.,1
We had to call every morning for our breakfast and twice one morning.,0
When you have a tour bus to catch you cant afford to wait around for your breakfast.,0
Finally the pool was only open for use once during our one week stay.,0
So if you are wanting a pool I dont suggest booking here.,1
"Great Location ,behind the Flower Markets,",0
Great location when we eventually found it,0
"Hopped onto a tram from Central Station but unfortunately nobody spoke English so we missed our stop, but found after going into one of the shops nearby.",0
"When we arrived Sat 10th March and went to check in, the receptionist explained that she did not have a room for us that night but only on Sunday, and we could stay in a 4 star nearby and then come back the following night.",0
Told her not happy about it.,0
"So I contacted Hotel Connect ,who we made our booking with - fantastic company, to ask what was happening with our booking, she promptly phoned the hotel, we could hear the conversation as we were sat in the lobby - quite funny really.",0
"After the receptionist put the phone down she then informed me that they did have a room afterall, but we could not check in after 2pm.",0
"We went out for a well earned drink and came back and we were actually given a family room on the 7th floor, nice view , but a very warm room, given that the weather was fab for the duration of our stay.",0
Breakfast was good but staff had a bit of an attitude to be honest.,0
"Would I stay there again, yes",0
Good Value Hotel,0
I stayed for two nights: with fees paid $62.00 on Hotwire per night.,0
Very nice reception.,0
Room was large and well laid out.,0
Big breakfast included.,0
Location is excellent.,0
"I lived very nearby in Miami Springs for sixteen years, so while the neighborhood doesnt look like much I know it is just airport industrial, and safe.",0
On the same street two or three miles past nice office parks to the west are all sorts of great restaurants.,0
"Will return, in all likellihood.",0
We stayed at The Benjamin from Feb 18-24.,0
"One of the great things about this hotel and any great hotel, is the staff.",0
"The Concierge Desk, Victor, Patrick, Mohammed, Jonathan, to name just a few, were always pleasant, efficient and helpful.",0
We booked a one bedroom suite which was on the 8th floor.,0
"Engineering and Housekeeping responsed promtly to any request ,to repair a light or a choice from their wonderful pillow menu.",0
"On return to our room one evening there was a note from Engineering with a box of Godiva chocolates, telling us that they had carried out repairs and apologizing for the inconvenience.",0
"We were a little baffled, as the light repair on the desk had been attended to, anyway we enjoyed the chocolates, but ,later in the evening as we turned on the television we realized that the television had been replaced with a flat screen model.",0
The room was wonderfully appointed.,0
Room service breakfast was very good.,0
"The location is superb, the best of New York is at your feet.",0
"Many thanks to the General Manager, Allen Kramme, for his note of welcome and the fruits and water on arrival.",0
"Great Hotel, Great location",0
Travelled with my wife and two friends to New York to see the St Patricks day parade.,0
We found the staff very helpful and pleasant.,0
Our room was on the 26th floor with a view of the empire state building from the bed,0
We stayed room only as eating out in New York is great.,0
"For the best breakfast tun left as you leave the hotel and walk up to where the small bridge crosses the road at Grand Central Station under this bridge straight across from the station you get the most fantastic breakfast, be early it gets very busy.",1
"The hotels location is second to none you have the Empire state, 5th Avenue, Grand Central, Chrysler Building, Times Square etc all within a few minute walk.",0
Ps Do the circle line boat tour to see the statue of liberty and the new york skyline it is fantastic.,1
Stayed recenty to attend a Giants game.,0
Didnt want to spend alot of dough and chose the Mosser.,0
"Im originally from the City and have known of the Mosser ,especially the dive hotel it was back in the 1980s,.",0
What a transformation,0
"Its a beautifully designed, well appointed and friendly staffed hotel.",0
"The employees are very helpful and knowledgeble ,overheard a desk clerk explaining our California Mission system to a foreigner,, though not overly solicitous ,with hand out,.",0
The location is perfect.,0
Bus to the ballpark is right in front.,0
Excellent restaurants within walking distance the Metreon for movies.,0
"Rooms are small, but perfect for what a busy or active traveler needs.",0
"Our room had a small chair that had a swing table on the arm and a foot rest that slid out, perfect for working on the laptop.",0
"Flat screen TV, dvd and stereo.",0
The famous one on Nob Hill doesnt even offer that,0
Ill recommend it to everyone heading to the City.,1
"The better hotels should take notice Mosser, Great job",0
Dont judge a book by its cover,0
"Hotel is in Fishermans Wharf, close to everything.",0
Exterior of hotel is very old and dated...I was worried when we drove up to check in.,0
But as soon as you entered you could see the renovations,0
VERY beautiful and stylish lobby.,0
"Rooms were great, as well.",0
We had a king bed in our room and had plenty of space.,0
Not much of a view as all the surrounding buildings are the same height.,0
"Great, clean rooms and bathrooms.",0
I would definitely stay here again.,0
PARKING: is $43 plus tax per day; watch out,1
My new favorite hotel,0
My husband and I stayed at the Sofitel New York August 4th-6th.,0
"After much research and reading of reviews on this site, I chose this hotel.",0
"It was our first trip to NYC and this was the ideal location, centrally located to tour the city.",0
We walked just about everywhere.,0
It was also very nicely tucked on a side street so it was always very quiet.,0
"The hotel is very clean, beautiful and offers friendly service.",0
I followed the advice that many people wrote and signed up for a free Sofitel Privileges card and also emailed the hotel to let them know we were there to celebrate our anniversary.,0
We were upgraded from a queen to king room with a view,0
We also received champagne and chocolates our first night.,0
With the Sofitel card we also had a 4 PM checkout which was great.,0
This is definitely my most favorite of all hotels I have stayed in and would absolutely stay here again and any other Sofitel.,0
I highly recommend this hotel especially for couples.,1
Nice modern hotel.,0
"My husband and I spent the weekend at the W New Orleans ,Dec. 11 - Dec 12, 2004,.",0
Loved the vibe of the hotel.,0
Great for the younger 30 something crowd.,0
"Not to be age pregidous but, didnt see anyone here that was older 60+ like other hotels in the immediate area as this one.",0
"Has very nice robes in room, CD player and DVD player.",0
Also has a neat candy machine in the room that is a nickle for some hot tamale candy.,0
"I thought it was a VERY quite hotel, but again we stayed on the 19th Floor.",0
Just about 3 blocks or so from the French Quarter and directly across the street from Harrahs Casino.,0
There are some cons about this hotel - REMEMBER - if you drive down your parking is NOT FREE,1
Looking at about $32.00 extra tacked on the hotel bill for valet overnight parking.,0
Dont be surprised about this as alot of the nicer hotels around New Orleans does this.,0
The rooms are a bit small for the price of the room.,0
Paid $209 for a basic king bedroom.,0
No frills - nice mini bar in room but VERY expensive.,0
$4 bucks for a candy bar,0
This is a great hotel if you want to stay somewhere a little different.,1
Pleased with stay,0
Were a family of four and stayed in their quad room for 2 nights in June.,0
The room was very spacious with a nice bathroom and nice amenities.,0
We were very pleased with our stay and would definitely stay there again.,0
PROS:Brothers who run the hotel are very helpful.,0
Breakfast was large and wonderful.,0
DVD with movies to borrow nice after a full day of sightseeing.,0
Bathroom updated nice.,0
Only a block away from a laundromat.,0
Elevator didnt appear to work.,0
I didnt have time to really research and simply booked whatever Priceline would honor.,0
I was very lucky to get this hotel.,0
It is located on the street parallel to the canal right behind the central train station.,0
Its  a 5 minute walk or you can take a tram.,0
A taxi will cost about 10 euros.,0
I paid 100 Euros for this reservation and upon arrival upgraded to a junior suite for additional 100 Euro.,0
I was not disappointed.,0
The rooms are modern and clean.,0
The mini bar is included.,0
The room has a shower AND a bath tub.,0
Breakfast is included in the main restaurant and has everything you might need or like.,0
All in all an excellent hotel.,0
Definitely will stay there again,0
hotel not a disappointment,0
"We must have just been unlucky with our experience of Paris, because what should have been a lovely time was ruined by at least 3 encounters of very rude Parisians and very expensive prices.",0
"The manager should have been promoted long ago,-I will never again meet such a Man who was so happy to help and rectify any problems- he was wonderful.",0
The stay was very comfortable and the room [small but ample] clean.,0
Modern-minimalis design and Clean,0
We booked a reservation at the Hotel Globus through its web-site based of the good reviews that we read on tripadvisor.,0
"Though, we are fully aware that european hotels are less in quality compared with the ones in Asia or US.",0
Thank you to Michelle who is one of the owner of this hotel.,0
"He gave us a good deal of Euro 90 for double executive room ,incl. buffet breakfast and taxes,.",0
We stayed there for 3 nights late December 2003.,0
To us the hotel is most likely a 2 stars with a 4 stars bathroom facility.,0
"Our room is spacious with internet access, cozy modern-minimalis design and clean.",0
The one which decreased the value of this hotel is that the lobby is up a flight of stairs.,0
Guests must climb with luggage.,0
when we arrived we were greeted by the front staff who helped us to bring our luggages up to the lobby.,0
We left our luggages at the front desk since the room reserved for us was still occupied.,0
"When we came back in the afternoon, our luggages had been brought in the room at 2nd floor.",0
The bar and breakfast place looked like a snack vendor and the only staff is very practical.,0
"Breakfast was fine european standard with fresh fruit, however we could ask for a cup of capucinno or even a glass of hot chocolate.",0
This hotel is recommended for budget travelers who do not mind to carry on your own luggages to the room and during check out.,1
We do not mind it either.,0
"The location is best, near the train station ,5 minutes walk, and many budget eating houses nearby.",0
Mercato St. Lorenzo is just steps from the hotel.,0
"The window of our room is facing the back of Medici Chapel, a warm scene in the morning of winter season.",0
We will absolutely stay there again if we get back to Florence one day.,0
"Nice little hotel, friendly staff",0
My wife and I stayed at the Coral Princess Inn for 3 days during October.,0
The room was clean and well maintained.,0
One thing we will remember about the room is that AC was freezing,0
But that isnt a bad thing.,0
The CPI is in walking distance to all of Condado as well as on the bus route for taking a trip to Old San Juan or to Isle de Verde.,0
Great price too,0
Great hotel; Great service,0
This is perhaps the beat hotel I have visitied in the United States.,0
"I thought the hotel would be packed, but there seemed to be plenty of romms available.",0
"I booked my room on priceline for $55.00 per night ,plus I had a free upgrade coupon to the club floor,.",0
The rooms are well appointed and spacious.,0
The bathrooms were larger than expected and the walk-in shower was wonderful.,0
"Not many places to eat, but there is a great market a block away.",0
I think the name was Central Market.,0
I had the BEST Mexican food I have ever eaten - very inexpensive,0
"I highly recommend the hotel, especially at the priceline rate of $55.00 per night ,+ tax and fees,.",1
"If you want an upgrade room, join the Guest Select program, and you will be sent a coupon for a free room upgrade coupon.",1
"after making the reservation, call the hotel and advise you have an upgrade coupon.",1
The upgrade will allow access to free Continental Breakfast and afternoon cocktails.,0
They cheated us,0
They acussed me and some friends of taking something from the minibar - they acussed us of lying.,0
In the few hours we were there we didnt even see there was a minibar.,0
"And we had to pay, because we didnt have the time to prove we were right.",0
Great Service And Lovely Rooms,0
"Great location, great rooms and great service",0
What more can you ask for?,0
Great value for Manhattan,0
I picked this hotel after weeks of reading reviews on this site and others.,0
I decided it offered the best value for money for what I was after and I wasnt to be disappointed.,0
Upon check-in we were upgraded to a corner room on the 30th floor.,0
I had read much about NYC hotel rooms being on the small side but our room at the Millennium Plaza was very spacious.,0
We had great views over the East River and over Midtown as well.,0
The room was modernly decorated and within easy walking distance of Grand Central Station and the subway.,0
Like others have already done so I would recommend Johns Cafe for breakfast and there is also a great 24 hour deli/store on the corner of 44th and 2nd.,1
My main gripe is that when you are paying $300 a night for a room you would expect to have free internet in your room.,0
This was not the case and we were charged $13 a day for the privelege.,0
During our time in the States we had stayed at other more basic hotels which offered free wifi in rooms.,0
"In fact, of the 5 hotels we stayed at in total the Millennium Plaza was the only one which did not offer free WIFI.",0
Avoid this Sweat Shop Resort,0
We just returned from Secrets Excellence in Punta Cana.,0
We will not return and there are many reasons why.,0
"We paid, for information, $2500 for 7 nights, two people, all-inclusive, air, Apple, a good deal/fair price in Americas winter.",0
We had problems and at first thought it was just us.,0
We arrived via Apple Vacations and check-in took around 2 hours... chaos at the front desk.,0
Our room ended up not being ready until 6 PM that evening--arrived 3 PM.,0
"Resort was 98% full, which explains a lot.",0
The horseback riding which is included is a joke..,0
the resort makes it diffficult to attain and book such reservations.,0
"For example, our 1st day there, not once in 7 days was the ride available at any time.",0
"And to find this fact out, we spoke with 4 different people.",0
We noticed the same workers cleaning @ 7 AM were later serving dinners @ 8 PM.,0
We felt sorry for them.,0
"We tipped everywhere, but still received poor service.",0
"Often we seated ourselves after waiting, waiting, and waiting some more--WITH A RESERVATION.",0
"We watched numerous people turned away, one on crutches, because their reservation was lost in a snafu.",0
"Again, we seated ourselves after waiting--WITH A RESERVATION for the main restaurant every night we ate there.",0
"One person would bring water, the other appetizers..",0
we often were brought courses twice because of the lack of communication.,0
Refills were offered twice during our entire stay in the main dining room.,0
"My husband actually got up once, walked to the soda fountain, glasses in hand, and refilled our sodas... and the workers who saw him do that said nothing.",0
"Many nights no reservations were available, we were told, despite there being 5 couples seated in a 117-person-capacity restaurant--we booked dinner every evening the 1st night there.",0
"We ordered pizza one night, and it never came, nor did we see our waiter after ordering d the situation.",0
They quickly got our order through and explained there were unsure where our waiter went.,0
We did not even attempt room service.,0
"Many nights, our room was not cleaned until 6 and 7 PM.",0
I kid you not.,0
"2 days went by where our room was not even cleaned at all, no new towels, nothing.",0
We called the front desk several times about this and nothing was done.,0
"The resort is either understaffed, poorly managed, or both.",0
"We wanted to make this trip special, fun, and the resort ruined it.",0
"The ocean was gorgeous, but rough, fellow tourists wonderful, and most staff were gracious--OUTSIDE the dining areas.",0
"Drinks were great, the trip was relaxing, booked a tour and swam with nurse sharks, stingrays--all in a cage.",0
"However, this resort was highly unorganized and for a 6 GOLDEN Apple rating, we would surely cringe to see a 4-star ratied resort, which must be a sewer with 3 people working per every 1,000 tourists.",0
"We have been to Mexico many times, other areas as well, and have never experienced such horrendous service and apathy.",0
"We were never mistreated, we just often werent treated at all.",0
"And tipping made no difference ,we would NEVER consider not tipping,.",0
"The hotel manager was not helpful, reservations for dinner in the main restaurant were unorganized, lost, and made little difference in service.",0
"One evening, dinner took 3.5 hours after arrival.",0
"We waited, waited, waited... the entrees?",0
"Breakfast was a bit better, and we realize this is not fast food, America, etcetera..",0
but we were not offered refills once during breakfast.,0
"Again, my husband walked, glasses in hand, and poured orange juice several times..",0
"it was so bad some other guests who walked by my husband commented, Hey, we saw you get up and get our own drinks and we were going to ask you to get ours, haha, since you are a better server than anyone working here..",0
"WE DID THE SAME THING, THOUGH...",0
We had an open mind.,0
"Punta Cana was pretty, but no better thappreciate tourism.",0
"We guess the resort pays nothing to its workers, and is a mere sweat shop.",0
The result: employees who are exhausted and dont care.,0
"We are unsure, at times, if ANYONE was managing the resort.",0
"The grounds were beautiful, but we noticed some cups in several common areas.... and these same cups remained until the date of our departure.",0
That means certain areas had not been cleaned in over 6 days...AVOID THIS RESORT.,0
SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO ELSEWHERE.,1
"AS A MATTER OF FACT, AVOID ALL SECRETS RESORTS, AS THEY ARE BUILDING WITHIN PLAYA DEL CARMEN, AND HAVE OTHER RESORTS.",1
"You have been warned, and we, I think, are nice people, who are often too timid to complain in any situation.",0
This resort even tried our patience.,0
"This review is real, and our experiences not exaggerated.",0
Its tough to find the positives after getting so upset about this vacation.,0
What a scam.,0
"This makes it easy for frequent stops during your day, to drop off shopping, etc.",0
The staff and very helpful.,0
"All in all, a very good tourist hotel.",0
Not a good experience,0
The location is perfect for shopping and restaurants.,0
The lobby is beautiful....we checked in and once in our room realized it was cold.,0
"We turned on the heater and waited for 3 hours, the room never got warm.....apparently the windows were not sealed.",0
"They moved us to another room, this room extremely hot....and the air conditioner did not work.",0
"They move us a third time, this room was small but it appeared to have working heat and air.",0
It was 1:30 am before we could finally settle down and rest.,0
The hotel management did not apologize or even offer an explanation...in fact the person at the front desk was rude.,0
We checked out the first thing the next morning and went to the Hyatt which was wonderful.,0
I would never stay at this hotel again.,0
"I understand things happen, an apology would have been nice.",1
The staff was extremely professional and courteous and bent over backwards to accommodate our requests.,0
We originally booked a partial ocean view to save money.,0
"When we saw our room, we were not pleased.",0
We were on the third floor looking over the roof - hardly any view of the ocean at all.,0
This was not what we had in mind for our Waikiki vacation.,0
We went to the front desk and requested an upgrade.,0
"Even though the hotel was fully sold out, they managed to put us into a full ocean view room for 4 nights.",0
My recommendation - spring for the extra money - the full ocean view is well worth it,1
"The beach is too small, but what beach isnt in Waikiki.",0
"The location, however, cant be beat.",0
"We bought air mattresses and paddled out in the ocean forever and the water never got rough ,this was summer,.",0
"My daughter took surfing lessons on the spot, which was very convenient.",0
"If I had one complaint, it was the quality of the fruit served for breakfast.",0
It was supermarket quality.,0
The pineapples tasted nothing like the delicious pineapples we had in Kauai the week before.,0
"Despite the marginal fruit, I will still give this hotel high marks.",0
"I stayed for two periods - the first I was upgraded to a suite which was beautifully furnished, clean and except for some electrical problems with operating the Jacuzi, was well above the standard I expected.",0
"The second period was spent in a standard room which was also large, clean and with many extras - slippers , bath robe , hairdryer etc.The staff were very helpful and the only thing I did not like was the breakfast which is optional.",0
"Getting there by taxi can be a small problem first time but the hotel gives you a map so after the first time, there are no problems.",0
"All in all , very good value for money , especially considering the saving on taxis which can amount to almost the price per day for this hotel",0
Great hotel away from the crowd,0
We have stayed at the hotel several times.,0
"It is with quiet nice, courteous staff, and clean rooms.",0
"The restaurant on the ground level facing the beach is a bit overpriced, especially for dinner ; the service staff can be a bit surly .",0
There is a sushi restaurant at the hotel which we have never tried.,0
"There are some amazing , and not touristy , restaurants a short cab ride away on Kapahulu Ave. that offer a variety of reasonable ethnic cuisine.",0
The rooms can be a bit small but I suggest ocean view only since the other rooms face high rises and this defeats the purpose of being in a tropical setting.,1
"I paid $53 per night for the Monarch, it was worth all of $20.",0
"I felt right at home in the neighborhood of the Monarch, then again I live right outside of Newark NJ, which explains why our car was keyed and our mirror was ripped off.",0
"I must give them credit at least they left the mirror on my windshield, so I guess they werent thieves, just vandals.",0
"Upon finding out my shower didnt work, the indifferent staff gave me a new room after only 10 min of arguing, which was nice.",0
"Overall, if cost is a main concern, and you want stay in a basic room for $50 with decent service, in an acceptable neighborhood, then you apparently dont have enough $$$ to stay in a San Francisco hotel, try an upgrade to a local hostel, or stay home.",1
"Gorgeous Hotel, Amazing View, A Little",0
"Out of the Way Hotel is stunning, luxurious and the views are really fantastic.",0
"It is a bit out of the way though, all the way at the of the Rocks.",0
"Clean, good location --but noisy",0
The hotel is in a good location near the train station and within 5-10 minutes walk to the Mercato Centrale and the Duomo.,0
The rooms are small but clean.,0
"However, it is noisy.",0
"If you are at all sensitive to noise, then it is very important that you get a room in the back of the hotel.",1
We stayed in the front and the traffic and other street noise was very loud.,0
The Pulitzer exceeded our expectations.,0
The design of the public spaces is very imaginative and the art work throughout the hotel is excellent.,0
"While the room was a bit small, the bathroom was quite large.",0
Three other couples travelled with us and everyone found the hotel enchanting - and the price modest.,0
I have visited Barcelona many times and intend to stay at the Pulitzer again the next time I visit the city.,0
"Needless to say, because of previous comments, was a bit wary but how wrong could you be?",0
"Perhaps the secret is to book the executive rooms because they certainly are spacious ,you can upgrade on check in,.",1
The use of the executive lounge is a bonus with free drinks and nibbles.,0
Breakfast is also served here and was a peaceful orderly event of an extremely high standard.,0
The staff were marvellous - very friendly and helpful - can also endorse the review regarding bell boy desk - they were a laugh a minute and everybody loves British football,0
The hotel is well positioned for MRT and all modes of transport and the taxis certainly are cheap.,0
Singapore is a beautiful clean place and I would have no hesitation in staying at the Golden Landmark on a return visit.,0
Coolest Hotel on the Planet,0
A fantastic hotel.,0
"Perfect location near all the great bars and restaurants, and yet superbly soundproofed so no noise to disturb you if you ever decide to go to bed",0
Room layout good - but would recommend some barrier to stop water from the shower getting the carpet wet,1
Receptionist superb and really helpful.,0
"One of, if not the best place Ive ever stayed at",0
"From the moment we stepped out of our car to the moment we departed, the service was excellent.",0
I highly recommend spending the extra money and staying in one of the rooms on the club level.,1
"While Im certain the service for all guests is exceptional, the extra attentiveness by Anthony, the Club Concierge was most welcome, especially from our daughter.",0
We will be staying at the Windsor Court every time we return to New Orleans.,0
hotel was fine with some exceptions,0
The hotel is well located and well priced.,0
"However, the room lacked enough closet space, e.g. no dresser drawers for storing clothing.",0
"The breakfast was very poor ,the hotel really economized here, and the coffee was very poor.",0
Good hotel - good position,0
We liked this hotel - it is not far from La Rambla and is just across the road from the Metro - Universitat stop.,0
Rooms were clean and comfortable and breakfast was good with plenty of choice.,0
Our Classic room was a bit small and you might consider upgrading to a larger room if you are staying for very long.,1
Staff were friendly and helpful - free safe in lock up behind the reception desk which is very useful as you need to make sure that you do not take anything of much value with you as there are many pick-pockets around.,0
I had my bag opened by a pick pocket within 5 minutes of arriving at the bus station - it was only luck that she did not get anything out of my bag - Having said that Barcelona is wonderful - dont let it spoil your stay but be careful,0
"Great Rooms, OK service.",0
Stayed at the Hilton Times Square 5 nights for a business event.,0
The rooms were above average for NYC and the were very clean.,0
The service wasnt great but it was OK.,0
"After getting a room on the 41st floor and a great recommendation for a sports bar around the corner, the quality of the service went down hill.",0
When I asked the concierge to help get a reservation to a new restaurant in the city she wasnt aware of it.,0
Teds Montana Grill opened the week that i was there and I wanted to get some buffalo steak.,0
She found a place called Teds IN Buffalo that she could get me into.,0
I had to give her the url and number of the place to call.,0
Great location if you need to be in the center of everything,0
Pleasantly surprised,0
"My husband was in New Jersey for business so our children and I ,8 yr old and 8 mo old, joined him in NYC for a long weekend.",0
When we arrived at 3:30am they did not have a Jr.,0
Suite available so we were upgraded to a 1 bedroom suite.,0
It was beautiful,0
It was newly renovated and very large.,0
"The bathroom was small, but the kitchenette and large living room more than made up for it.",0
The entire suite was impeccably clean.,0
"I have travelled many, many times and this by far was the nicest budget-minded hotel I have ever stayed in.",0
"The beds were extremely comfortable ,new,.",0
"The hotel lobby, hallways and elevators are not at all impressive and very small, but the large clean rooms are a pleasant surprise when you open the room door.",0
We could not hear a peep from other guests through the walls or hallways.,0
The other bad reviews must have gotten older rooms before they were renovated.,0
Ours was perfect.,0
We will definately stay there again.,0
"We were in a deluxe room ,dont be fooled, these are the basic rooms, which was really small, compared to the fantastic villa we had in Benoa for less then half the price,",1
"It was nicely done, but not Balinese at all, and we felt a little bit stark.",0
We arrived at lunchtime - ordered food and proceeded to wait a LONG time.,0
"A couple who ordered food after us were given complimentary drinks because of the wait, but we werent.",0
"Another guest was complaining about another issue at the same time, so it wasnt the best introduction.",0
"The setting and pool are gorgous, but as others have said there are nowhere near enough loungers, so people were lying on the floor - not what you expect from a 5 star hotel.",0
The restaurant was pretty terrible - the worst nasi goreng I had in 2 weeks by far.,0
"The shuttle isnt regular enough, and the town of Ubud is fantastic - loads of lovely restaurants, and quiet away from the main streets - I would really recommend staying in the town.",1
Love Casa Alta Vista,0
We just returned from Vieques.,0
"Tha hotel is well located from Esperanza, the beach and the restaurants.",0
The acommodations were simple but very clean with a small fridge and a microwave in the room.,0
"The staff is friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful.",0
They made our reservations for the Bio Bay tours with Island Adventures and it was perfect.,0
Perfect hotel for the active traveler who enjoys a very active day in the island outside of the property and just wants a nice and clean room to rest.,0
It also offers a small store where supplies at modest prices.,0
"They also rent beach chairs, coolers and beach towels.",0
"Loved Princess Bavaro, but it is not for Americans",0
Just got back yesterday from Princess Bavaro hotel in Punta Cana and I can tell you that the hotel is beautiful.,0
The rooms are big and the hotel its self is clean.,0
"Since the mayority of vacationers are from Spain, Portugal, Canadian and Argentinian to name a few, most of the food is guided toards them.",0
"Now, I am not by any means saying that the food is bad, the food is very well prepared but I did not like most of their food because I am not use to eating European style food.",0
2.- People that are cleaning your rooms and serving your food are always with a smile on their faces and are always polite to everybody and should always be tiped well.,0
",These people work twelve hour days, dont get paid over-time and only get paid about $200 USD A MONTH,.",0
As soon as they see the hotel ristband they try and charge you the highest price in the word.,0
"I know that that is what they do but come-on, $22 USD for a raw hamburger with fries?",0
"This happened to me, the bill that the hamburger place was for 200 Dominican Pesos and they charged me $22 USD.",0
"The good thing is that i was complaining to one of the vendors about the price of the hamburger when a tourist police passing by heard my conversation, he asked me if I had a problem, and I told him what had happened to me.",0
I ended up paying $7 USD.,0
"In conclusion, If you are an American planning on going to the Dominican Republic, Think it twice please.",1
"I am not in any way saying dont go, it is a very beautiful country, most people are nice, but, there is not a lot of places to go like in Mexico, where you can take a bus and you are at the shopping mall in 10 min.",0
I hope that this is usefull to everybody.,0
"In no way do I mean any disrespect to anybody, and if anybody fells disrespected, I apoligize from the bottom of my heart.",0
"The hotel in it self is quite ok, little run down but nice people and good service.",0
The hotel is close to WTC but to close to La Rambla for my tast.,0
The connecting roads to this area are in the late evenings and nights a dangerous place to be.,0
"If you like quietness, as I do, ask for a room at the backside not fasing the street and higher up.",1
The hotel has maximum 6 floors.,0
"Do not expect a excellent view, but you cant get it all.",1
"And quietness is worth something I think:-,",0
Lovely little boutique hotel,0
This is a really nice little hotel in a great location: theres a subway and Amtrack station 5 minutes walk away.,0
The rooms all have cable TV and theres free internet access in the lobby.,0
They also do a nice free breakfast snack of coffee/ tea and muffins and bagels.,0
The staff were welcoming and helpful with suggestions of where to eat and what to do.,0
Boston itself is a really easy city to walk around and I would highy recommend it for a short break.,1
just an amazing hotel just an amazing hotel.,0
easy check in with the front desk person taking us up to the room to explain everything.,0
Beautiful large rooms with a separate sitting area and desk.,0
Breakfast buffet in hotel restaurant had everything you would want to start your day.,0
Did not go to the spa but other women in my travel group said it was one of the nicest they had been to.,0
Great location.,0
Wonderful concierge who recommended restaurants as well as sent me to a bike shop where i could rent a bike to ride around frankfurt for the day.,0
I wish we could have stayed longer and unfortunately it was the first hotel of a 5 city german trip so I will have to compare every hotel to this one.,0
I am not sure the Villa Kennedy can be topped.,0
A must if you have an unlimited expense account since the rooms are very expensive but certainly worthwhile,1
Paradisus severely lacking.,0
Stayed at the paradisus for our honeymoon sept. 18-24.,0
"We arrived at the Paradisus around 4pm on the 18th and were greeted with a strawberry fruit drink while checking in, in the expansive, gorgeous open air lobby.",0
Upon arrival to our room we found a beautiful arrangement of towel figures upon our bed along with Good night spelled out in flowers.,0
Very nice touch.......until I went into the bathroom and found it infested with ants.,0
I called the bellman back along with the representative that checked us in and was assured it would be taken care of while we went to get something to eat.,0
"Upon searching for somewhere to eat we discovered that the place was like a ghost town,not a bad thing, and that the only place to eat was at the italian restaurant.",0
One restaurant open at 4:30 pm?,0
Not exactly my idea of exclusive service and definitely not mentioned during booking or in the brochure.,0
"Having no choice, Italiian it was.",0
The food I ordered was not the food I recieved and the pizza was less than acceptable.,0
Upon further investigation I found out the resort was operating at less than 20% capacity.,0
Returning to the room I was disappointed again to find that our insect infestation problem was not addressed.,0
I called the front desk and was told someone would be out immediately.,0
Within 5 minutes a hotel employee showed up with a can of bug spray and a rag and went to work.,0
5 minutes later he is finished and leaves.,0
The bugs are still there and now the room smells like raid.,0
"I call the desk again and voice my displeasure and request a new room, which they take care of in about 30 minutes.",0
"No apology, no offer of upgrade, no sort of compensation.",0
Whatever.,0
This review could go on forever so I will condense.,0
For the next 5 days the resort had a series of rolling blackouts which they would announce with a note under your door everyday.,0
This meant no electricity in certain portions of the complex everyday.,0
"No electricity means, no blended drinks, no AC, no light to see during the buffet breakfast,which there is only one of everyday,, no hot water, etc.",0
I dont know if this is a way to save money when the resort is slow or what but definitely unacceptable at a supposed 5 star resort.,0
Now on to my main complaint.,0
"The resort has a claimed ten restaurants open for dinner, with two of them requiring reservations.",0
"Every night, and I mean every single night of our stay, a minimum of four of the listed restaurants were closed, and two were actually just one place named twice.",0
Each night there was no more than three choices of places to eat.,0
"The worst part was, you didnt know what was going to be closed until the day it was closed.",0
"We didnt get to eat at the Mexican restaurant,which we heard was outstanding, because it was only open two nights we were there and we had reservations at the other two restaurants those nights.",0
What a major disappointment.,0
"False advertising aside, I feel as if I didnt get the exclusive all inclusive treatment that they advertise and that I paid for.",0
"Dont promise me something that I paid for and I expect to get and then not deliver because its the off season, or your not at full capacity.",0
"As far as the grounds, the beach, and the pool, absolutely beautiful.",0
"Walking to the shops, you may want to mentally prepare yourself for the abuse you will take from the local shop owners,aka vultures, that will swoop down upon you to practically drag you into their shops.",1
"Would I ever I go back to the Punta Cana, yes, would I ever go back to the Paradisus, definitely not.",0
great hotel 14 of us stayed here for a hen weekend our stay was almost faultless.,0
"The only problem we had was one room had a very loud buzzing during the night ,room 505, apparently it was to do with it being above the restaurant, however as soon as we mentioned it to reception, we were immediately moved without fuss to a suite",0
"so we were more than happy, the hotel staff even moved all of our luggage.",0
"Check -in was fine, as there was 14 of us it took a while but no longer than youd expect, plus we were all upgraded from standard to deluxe rooms.",0
"Breakfast was quite pricey at 18euros each, but it was a buffet you could eat as much as you like, so if you have a big appetite, perhaps its good value, and if you didnt want to pay 18euros then dont eat it...",1
"The location was excellent, 5min cab journey to Las Ramblas, which was approx 6-7 euros.",0
"Approx 8/10mins cab ride to the Bogatell beach , this was roughly 9-10euros, worth it as we tried the metro that was a nightmare experience because of the heat.",0
"I would definately stay here again, the staff were very friendly, one of the nights we all gathered in reception on our way out we were quite noisy taking photos ,as we were on hen wkend, and the staff were more than happy to help take photos join in...I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in Barcelona, great value for money",0
"Stay away from this hotel, if you really need to be downtown stay in a well known chain for a few extra bucks, your peace of mind will be worth it.",1
"Basic, but comfortable, accomodations in a great location",0
"We originally found this hotel in Nov 2005 through the Rick Steves travel book, and we loved the location.",0
Tip: pay in cash and have a Rick Steves book to get discounts.,1
"The family that runs the hotel is wonderful, and will go out of their way to make you feel welcome ,in your language when possible, as well as book you reservations and make recommendations.",0
"The location is amazing, very near the Duomo ,if you are a light sleeper this can be bad for the tolling bells,, just around the corner from the Piazza Republica and down the street from the Uffizi museum and square.",1
"The rooms themselves are comfortable, but a little on the older side.",0
"They are well maintained though ,even if the bathrooms could be helped by a little bleach,.",0
"They offer handicapped accessible rooms which are more spacious and located at the enterior of the hotel ,which I would recommend as those staying with rooms facing the streets often complain of the noise,.",1
"All in all, not bad for the convenience.",0
We arrived at the Eastgate Tower Suites and were amazed at how cute this hotel was.,0
The lobby was decorated beautifully and the staff were very friendly.,0
To our surprise they upgraded us the a bigger room.,0
The room was clean and HUGE,0
"It had a full Kitchen, dining room area, bedroom with 2 beds and pull out couch.",0
There were 6 ladies all together and this room gave us plenty of room to get ready and sleep.,0
The location was great.,0
"It is a short cab ride to Time Square, 5th Avenue, and all the shopping areas.",0
We walked there as well and the walk was not too bad at all.,0
It was also in a great location for all the hot Manhattan Night Clubs.,0
Next time I visit NYC I will definitley be staying here again.,0
Fantastic hotel - will be going back asap,0
A colleague and myself stayed at 1898 at the beginning of July for a work trip.,0
It was around the same price as some of the more traditional hotels on La Ramblas but you got so much more for your money.,0
"The hotel is really modern but has an old school charm, for example dark oak walls and marble floored bathroom.",0
It adds a cosy feel without losing the sleekness.,0
"Oh by the way, bedrooms have a free pillow menu",0
Breakfast was great and catered for all the health freaks to full on english breakfast and cakes.,0
Fabulous Hotel I just got back from an overnight stay at this hotel and,0
I must say it was great,0
This is my first time leaving a review.,0
"Check In is at 3 PM, however, we arrived at 10 AM and got our room right away",0
"After check out on our last day, they held our luggage at the hotel while we did some more sightseeing.",0
The rooms were spacious.,0
The beds were super comfy and the shower was awesome,0
The location is in the heart of Times Square and a block from Port Authority.,0
I would recommend without any hesitation.,0
Loved it.,0
This place has it all - great spa casino and pool.,0
the service was excellent.,0
i got engaged on the beach here and had the time of our lives.,0
the guest servicesdepartment delivered champaigne and put rose pedals on our bed at night.,0
it was amazing.,0
it is close to the airport but you cant hear many airplanes.,0
the vineyard restaurant is fantastic.,0
get to the pool early to reserve a spot,0
The Ritz made it worthwhile,0
My husband and two children ages 8 and 5 all loved our stay at the Ritz Carlton.,0
It was our first time to the island of Puerto Rico which was not as exciting as we had hoped but the hotel and the service were absolutely superb.,0
The staff was unbelievalbly accomodating and attentive to all our needs.,0
The service was so awesome that we almost expected the same wherever we went ---we were really spoilt and in for a surprise as we moved around Old San Juan.,0
The room was fantastic and clean and well designed .,0
Our kids loved the Ritz-kids program which we tried for a day and much to our dismay the kids preferred to be in the program than to visit the island with us.,0
I would stay here again but I must say the price for food and drinks were a bit excessive.,0
Truly worth staying at this hotel.,0
Paradise Had a 3 night stopover and must say the hotel was brilliant.,0
For some reason we were given the honeymoon treatment with fresh fruit etc. a lovely surprise.,0
The room had just been renovated and we were one of the first to stay in it.,0
Beautiful decor and great views from the 3 windows in the room,0
Staff were helpful but the breakfasts were a bit expensive.,0
"Location is brilliant, right next to the bustling Clarke Quay with its many bars and restaurants.",0
I would thoroughly recommend the hotel.,0
4* NH Central Station,0
We just spent a night in this hotel and it deserves a higher ranking,0
"First it is true that the hotel is about 10min by car from the central station and the building looks terrible from the outside ,used to be an old hospital,.",0
"But it is a 4* hotel ,by international standards, and is is MUCH better then any hotel you can find in the city centre in that price range.",0
"The hotel is used by the staff of North West Airlines ,they get better prices,.",0
The rooms are very nice and the beds very comfortable.,0
The shuttle bus works excellent.,0
"It goes every 20min to the NH Barbizon ,much more expensive, across the central station ,near the red light district,.",0
The last bus from the centre to the hotel leaves at 02:45am,0
I really do not understand all the negative comments.,0
It is an excellent hotel at an excellent price,0
"it has no frills, at least not my room, but so what?",0
"the room has a bed, a balcony, and a bathroom and that is it.",0
a space heater is included for the cooll evenings as well.,0
but you should be out enjoying the city anyways.,0
it is located a 10 minute walk to the mtero system and close to major streets so that you can take the buses if you are brave enough.,0
"the owners are very nice people and will call cabs for you, make suggestions, and fill other reasonable requests.",0
enjoy,0
It was in a good area.,0
"Walking distance of Fishermans Wharf, Alcatraz Ferry, and the F-Line Street car and cable cars.",0
"The room was very clean, bed very comfy and free wired internet access.",0
My only complaint is street noise.,0
"We were on the street side of the hotel, and the street was pretty noisy with people all night long.",0
"Not really the hotels fault, just the location.",0
"This hotel aint cheap, but it is in the middle of a very touristy area.",0
The only way I was able to stay here was by using some Marriott gift certificates we had.,0
Loved it An absolute gem of a hotel,0
Extremely friendly and very helpful staff.,0
"Clean,comfortable room.",0
Comfortable bed with fresh sheets everyday.,0
Secure safe in the room for your valuables.,0
Plenty of choice for breakfast.,0
Hotel is located within 500m of the Duomo and within easy walking distance of all the major sights.,0
If you cant be without the internet there is even free access in the bar.,0
Will we stay there again-Yes,0
Great location We stayed at the Le,0
Meridien right after they took over from the Park Hyatt so things were still a bit chaotic-everything still said Hyatt.,0
"Despite that the service was great, the room was luxurious and we had a great time.",0
The rooms are slightly masculine in feel.,0
The room service was particularly good.,0
The location is great right near the Embarcadero with the ferry building and all the shops.,0
"Very easy to walk to restaurants, even to walk to North Beach.",0
This hotel is very quiet and convenient.,0
We will definitely stay there again.,0
"Great location, perfectly nice hotel",0
We stayed at the Hotel Casci on the first 2 nights of our 2 week trip.,0
"It was a perfect location, allowing us to get out quickly to see the sights, and make easy visits back for a rest or to freshen up.",0
The staff are absolutely lovely.,0
The breakfasts were some of the best we had throughout our trip.,0
"The room was a reasonable size, and the bathroom was quite large compared to our other stays.",0
The entire hotel was spotless.,0
Our only complaint - and this is a really odd one - is that our room smelled of what we could only describe as cabbage.,0
"Our room was towards the back of the hotel, and the smell became evident the further back you walked.",0
"We never determined if it was the water and dampness in the room if we didnt leave our windows open ,our guess,, our someone in the courtyard with a deep love of boiled cabbage.",0
"Like I said, very odd.",0
It certainly wouldnt keep us from staying there again.,0
Its also become kind of a fun joke that we still mention.,0
"Overall, a great hotel in a city where Im sure its easy to pick a bad one.",0
"Again, I cant say enough about the staff, just fabulous people.",0
loved the royal hotel is in excellent location on,0
"room was attractive, clean, adequate size and very quiet even though faced on La rambla. restaurant was convenient and good for all meals though lots of small restaurants in area provideding easy access for meals.",0
Desk staff very helpful and pleasant---would definitely stay there again.,0
That is a promise....,0
So....I was obsessive about reading the reviews and checking out the forums for the PCP for weeks before my trip and all I can say is this resort is fantastic.,0
"If you go with the attitude that you are on vacation and leave your expectations at home, you will have the time of your life.",0
"That being said, there are some areas that will exceed your expectations.",0
"Rooms: Very nice, clean, clean, clean.",0
a/c worked exceedingly well and the maids were fantastic.,0
Dont forget to tip...,1
"They work from sun up until very, very late at night and make next to nothing.",0
"Pool : Beautiful, well kept, lots of shade and the swim up bar was great.",0
"No kids, no loud music and if I had to offer only one morsel, it was that there was no pool side drink service.",0
You had to either swim up or walk up to get served.,0
Staff: These people are the hardest workers I have ever seen.,0
They work and work and work to make this resort clean and comfortable.,0
They are quick with a hello and the hugs are a plenty.,0
"Tip, tip, tip and you will not be sorry.",1
A buck goes a very long way.,0
Beach: Not much to say here but lovely.,0
One of the most beautiful I have ever seen...,0
Food : Well ........This is the only negative experience that I can speak of.,0
"Although there are many choices, dont go with an expectation that you will be having a fine dining experience.",1
"The fodd was tolerable and I always found somehting to eat, but honestly it just isnt very good.",0
"From everything that I have heard and read this is not just at the PCP, but at most of the resorts too.",0
The cuts of meat are different and they try very hard to have something for everyone.,0
"To me ,and I am a foodie from SF, this is not a deal breaker.",0
"Drinks: Unless you like really sweet drinks, you might want to consider bringing your own mixers..",1
I know that sounds crazy but even the mixer were a little odd.,0
"The soda was odd, the tonic was odd and the OJ tasted like tang.",0
"There really is no good wine choice and if you are a wine drinker, bring your own.",1
"The beer is okay when cold ,dont forget the bubba keg, and there is always a very happy and gracious bartender to get you whatever you want.",1
Bottom line - this is a terrific place.,0
I would not hesitate to return or to recommend the PCP to anyone.,0
Terrible from start to finish,0
This was my worst hotel stay ever.,0
Hotwire should be embarrassed go carry this hotel.,0
When I arrive the valet man start yelling at us.,0
The we went inside and the manager didnt really care.,0
He was to busy flirting with the female guests.,0
We final got checked in and they put us in a room between the ice machine and the elevator so it was noisy all the time.,0
The every morning at 8:00 AM housekeeping would knock.,0
There were no Do Not Disturb signs.,0
Then after telling htem to come back later.,0
They would be back in 15 minutes.,0
We final wrote a note on the door but they did not speak english to read it.,0
Then one night we returned about 1:30 AM to crash and our neighbor left on his music really loud.,0
We called downstairs and they replied Sorry.,0
We finally got someone to come turn it off about 2:30 AM.,0
"Then on checkout, there was yet another mess.",0
"Needless to say, I will not return.",0
"I explained how bad everything was when I left, they replied you will have to talk to hotwire.",0
Wonderful hotel but bring your ear plugs,1
We felt very welcome and comfortable right from the beginning.,0
All reception staff were great and more than ready to answer any questions we might have had.,0
"Room was comfortable, quite spacious, well appointed and very clean.",0
"Breakfast, although continental was also quite good, particularly coffee which was excellent.",0
Breakfast available until 10.30 which was also nice.,0
"Good location, near to trams and nice restaurant area.",0
Lovely park nearby too.,0
Shuttle from airport worked well.,0
"However on the minus side lighting in room at night was dim and bedside lights were a strain to read by, which we like to do.",0
The bedroom walls are also paper thin and so you are disturbed by other room sounds.,0
Anyone running a bath/shower or using a hair dryer could be doing so in your own room.,0
Also all doors seem to have to slam to close.,0
"So unless you are a really early riser or a really heavy sleeper, the noise factor will be quite a problem.",0
The loctaion was as good as it gets and overall couldnt be faulted.,0
"All staff were so helpful, deluxe rooms incredibly spacious with the beds being the closest thing to heaven.",0
I read all the review and i thanks to them i decided to stay here.,0
Trust me you wont be disappointed.,0
I am travelling back to London next year and wont stay anywhere else.,0
"Great location, views",0
"It has recently been remodeled and looks beautiful, very modern and super clean.",0
This hotel is actually closer to Chinatown than it is to the Financial District.,0
"It is a great location - close to North Beach, Union Square and Chinatown.",0
We stayed on the seventeeth floor.,0
"Our room ,1717, had a great view of the bay, Coit tower and the St. Peter Paul Church Spires.",0
It was a little pricier but so worth it if you are into views.,0
I wish I had read reviews on this site prior to booking.,0
The hotel is advertised as being newly refurbished with luxurious rooms.,0
"The first room we were taken to had only a shower, and barely enough room to set down our bags.",0
It was not newly refurbished by any means.,0
"The second room we were shown was again, extremely small, and very hot.",0
"I asked why the air conditioning was not on, and was told they turn it off during this time of the year.",0
The small window on the slanted ceiling opened minimally and was of no help.,0
"We asked again to be moved to one of their luxurious suites ,as advertised on their website, and were told they had no such thing as a suite in that hotel.",0
The only good thing I would say about this hotel is that the manager had enough sense to call Expedia to assist with getting our reservations changed.,0
We loved our stay,0
I was expecting the worst and received the best.,0
This Hotel is located just two blocks from the Pacific Science Center and the Space Needle.,0
"If you are looking to do downtown Seattle as a tourist you cannot do much better, in my opinion, than the Best Western Executive Inn.",1
I utilized Expedia and got a double queen for 65.00 a night.,0
In my opinion it was a great deal.,0
I and my daughter cannot think of one negative experience.,0
Secure parking was a nice plus.,0
Front desk staff was exceptional.,0
Breakfast was great.,0
Rooms were clean and comfortable.,0
Bottom line.....Great value in Downtown Seattle and I would stay there again and again.,0
I made a reservation to stay here in August 2007 and just got charged for the night I canceled.,0
So I would recommend that if you reserve a room here and cancel SAVE YOUR CANCELATION NUMBER,1
not as friendly as these posts elude,0
"Because of all the positive comments we had read here, we werent too worried about our stay.",0
"Unfortunately, we were not very pleased.",0
The place seemed a little run down and the staff was not friendly at all.,0
The woman at the front desk didnt even greet us with a hello to us when we came into the front office...something you would expect if everyone proclaims they are friendly.,0
"In addition, when we met up with our friends and they helped us unload our luggage, the lady from the front desk ran out and confronted us about having extra people.",0
We explained that they were our friends FROM SF there to show us around...only helping us carry our luggage.,0
"When we checked out the next day she yelled from the front office window at us, while we are on the street.... that she was charging us for extra people....and they did",0
"However, only 2 of us stayed at the hotel",0
So much for friendly staff,0
Weve stayed in San Francisco before and I would recommend the Commodore Hotel or another Experience Rewards hotel in the SF area.,1
"Those were similarly priced, friendlier, and a better quality room for the money.",0
I would avoid this place and would not go hear again.,0
Great Hotel My girlfriend and,0
The location is perfect and close to everything Boston has to offer.,0
"We had booked a standard room, but upon arrival we were asked if we wanted an upgrade to a superior room, for a very small surcharge.",0
The room was just wonderful and was well furbished with a large bed and a working desk.,0
The bathroom was quite small but it was nice and clean.,0
However the best thing about the room was the wonderful view of the Boston skyline.,0
The hotel staff was very helpful and we felt very welcome at the hotel.,0
I decided to stay in,0
"After reading all these good reviews I stayed in first class room ,nothing first class about it; small room, no amenities - shampoo etc available, and after the third night ,they had not changed the sheets, I found a little blood in the sheets.",0
My alarm bells did not ring then....The fouth morning the bed was covered with bedbuggs and they had eaten me all over.,0
"I complained at the Reception and all they did was only noting it down, they did not apology and the matter did not seem to suprise them.",0
Luckily that was my last night at the A-Train.,0
Besides this the room was on the very busy street side and there were roadworks going on during the night.,0
Luckily I managed to purchase earplugs later.,0
"On the positive side the breakfast and the breakfastroom were very nice and the personnel was nice ,untill I complaint about the bugs,.",0
Stunning and refreshing,0
One of the best hotels Ive ever stayed in.,0
"First of all, the stunning design bowled us over - we didnt want to leave the room.",0
The staff was very friendly and did their best to please us.,0
"The hotel is still new, so their bar wasnt open, but their sauna was great.",0
Room service was on the pricey side - two coffees were 11 Euro.,0
We didnt eat breakfast at the hotel.,0
Note that the hotel offers great packages on its website - the best way to go.,1
"They offeryou a choice of pillows - a neck roll, a spelt pillow, a hot water bottle - they encourage you to ask for them and that really made the trip special.",0
"Also the location is excellent - right next to the SBahn, 10 minutes from the Reichstag on foot.",0
"I cant wait to go back, my husband and I considered the hotel a high point of the trip.",0
Mary Jane Rocks at the Magic Castle,0
We enjoyed our stay last week at the Magic Castle.,0
We got a great rate that was advertised on Travelzoo.com,0
The rooms are okay.,0
They are huge but need a bit of freshening up.,0
Breakfast was sufficient for being free and the pool was nice.,0
Parking for $9 was the cheapest we saw on our trip.,0
The best part about this hotel is the front desk attendant Mary Jane.,0
"She provided us insight on where to go and what to do, helped us book reservations at the hottest restaurants and used her connections to get us it.",0
It became a joke that every day we had to go to Mary Jane to figure out what we were going to do and where we were going to eat,0
Overall Good Value for the Money,0
"We enjoyed our stay, but we always make the best of a situation.",0
Nice view of Diamond Head and the movie screen on the beach.,0
"Updated ,meaning decor, not renovated really,Nice decor, fun, floralSmall refrigerator in the roomOne Valet and One Front Desk clerk were super",0
"Nice seating options at the pool, nice lounging areas, relaxing.",0
"Two full size beds in a tiny closet of a room ,1107, with four people, three over 58 tall.",0
"It was too small, the bathroom is tiny, can hardly turn around in it",0
"Watch the bartender at Tikis, they let some blond guy from Iowa charge his drinks to my tab without asking me about it.",0
"Considering I had just arrived ,with my three kids, it wasnt likely I was buying drinks for some stanger in a bar.",0
"We called for our luggage ,take yours up yourself, and they said five to ten minutes.",0
"We waited thirty and it still had not arrived, so after two calls down ,and snotty clerks, we just left.",0
The luggage came sometime later while we were at dinner.,0
The pool was small and most always very crowded.,0
My ten year old wouldnt go in due to it being too full.,0
"We are the type to always make the best of a situation, so we did.",0
"We had an enjoyable stay, it wasnt terrible, but I wouldnt be inclined to stay at that hotel again.",0
"However, I was told that many of the hotel rooms are very small, I dont know if this is true.",0
"Thanks to Del ,valet area, and Kieth ,front desk, we were taken care of.",0
The rest of the staff were aloof and didnt really have any concept of customer service.,0
"Final note, FOR THE MONEY ,$159/nt, and the fact that its right across the road from the main beach, its a decent value for a nice location.",0
We found most beach front locations to be much more costly.,0
"It is a cute place, they have done some fun things with the decor.",0
"There is easy access to food downstairs, Starbucks on the corner, ABC Markets everywhere.",0
"Also, if you need services find a good front desk clerk, they helped us find a rental car when we were told none were available at all locations we called.",1
A Bit of a Disappointment,0
My teenage daughter and I stayed at this hotel for four nights in early July.,0
"Our room was dark due to subdued lighting and a small window, but to be fair I did ask for a quiet room.",0
It was fairly quiet.,0
"If I had known what we would get, I would have asked for a room with a large window.",0
The room had a very swampy odour when the air conditioning was turned off.,0
"We tried to leave our extra card in the outlet slot so the air conditioning would stay on, but it was taken out by the maid and eventually she took it for good.",0
I had some febreeze so it was bearable.,0
"The decor was nice, different and a bit funky.",0
"I was happy to get it, but a working minibar would have been preferable.",1
The staff were very helpful and always polite.,0
The restaurant they recommended was good.,0
I think it was called Ginger.,0
"The area was really nice, away from the crazy busy areas.",0
"Overall it was an o.k. experience, but I would probably try somewhere else the next time.",0
Had a great time.,0
Hotel was in a great location.,0
Close to the Leidsplien and other main streets.,0
"Rooms were fine - ,some nicer than others,, but all were cleaned every day.",0
Staff were always pleasant and helpful.,0
Bar prices very good.,0
Little terrace was lovely for sitting and relaxing.,0
"Breakfast was very good with a choice of cereal, various breads, ham, cheese, eggs, fruit salad, juice + a selection of teas and coffee.",0
This hotel will definetly be my choice of hotel when we plan our next visit to Amsterdam.,0
"Perfect locaion, wonderful staff",0
My husband and I just stayed at the Grand Hyatt and loved it.,0
We were in Seattle for a meeting at the convention center and it was right across the street.,0
"It was the perfect location for shopping,too.",0
Everything is right there and you are in walking distance of Pike Market Place.,0
"The hotel has a Starbucks, Ruth Chris Steakhouse and The Cheesecake Factory.",0
Ruth Chris is also the hotels main restauraunt and bar.,0
"They serve breakfast, lunch and dinner there.",0
The breakfast selection was terrific and of course the dinner was fabulous.,0
"We never had lunch there, but Im sure it was good also.",0
They have a great happy hour with half price appetizers from 4-6 and again from 9-11.,0
The rooms were nice and the bathrooms were great.,0
"There is a coffeemaker in the room, a nice hairdryer, iron and ironing board and a safe in the closet.",0
Everything you need right there.,0
"The staff was so nice and helpful, they really added to our wonderful week in Seattle.",0
"If we are ever back in Seattle, we will definatley stay at the Grand Hyatt",0
The staff are exceptional and the location is as good as it gets - one min walk from Union Square.,0
"We stayed at The Orchard Hotel when we first arrived, it was twice the price and is further away from Union Square.",0
Our room was compact but exceptionally clean and comfortable.,0
This hotel reminds me of an old New York hotel.,0
"After three weeks travelling in CA and staying in all types of accommodation ,5 star, BBs etc, The Chancellor is one of the nicest places we have stayed.",0
PS. the breakfast is good,0
"Lots of fun Me and my girlfriend just returned from the bravelo beach resort in Punta Cana, and we were overall very satisfied.",0
"The resort was right on the beach lots of palm Trees very tropical, we always had good service at the restaurants; the best and most friendly restaurant was the Mexican.",0
"The service was very welcoming, the bars were really busy and the wait for drinks took a little longer, but we were not disappointed waiting a few extra minutes for our drinks.",0
"When you travel to the Caribbean you have to be prepared that not everything is going to be perfect, but you have to have a positive attitude and always make the best out of everything.",0
"Small, but sexy room",0
"Yes, the room is small.",0
The queen sized bed on one wall with a small desk on one side and a small nightstand on the other.,0
"However, the room is styled so nicely and sexy that its not even noticed.",0
Excellent bedding and appointments really set this place apart from other rooms in this town.,0
"Its San Francisco, how much time do you really expect to spend in the room??",0
The bathroom is really nice sized considering the size of the room; plenty large enough for two people to navigate in.,0
The Aveda products were also a nice surprise,0
"The sitting room off to the side of the room was the best part; plasma screen on the wall, armoire for hanging up clothes, a mini bar and a loveseat.",0
I will certainly stay here again when I pass through.,0
Heavenly is right,0
"This was our first stay at a Westin, and it was definitely very close to heaven.",0
"The rooms were very clean, and we had a beautiful view of the Hudson river from the 22nd floor.",0
The beds were extremely comfortable as is the trademark of the Heavenly beds.,0
"The service was good overall, and breakfast we had was delivered on time and was very tasty.",0
"I had to ask for bathrobes which were advertised as part of the room package, but they were delivered promptly.",0
The bathroom door was a pocket metal door with a glass insert panel that slammed shut every time it closed.,0
"You could hear the doors shut in the adjacent rooms as well, but overall it was a great experience for Times Square during the Christmas season.",0
"The price was jacked up for the Christmas holiday, but you only live once",0
"Stayed at the Singel for 2 nights for a football trip, the place is easy to find, in a good location, near the station,on the Singel canal, next to a church.",0
The guy I roomed with works in pest control and was a stickler about vermin bed bugs etc before we went and he had no complaints unlike some of our other guys who stayed elsewhere in the city so read into that what you will,0
"At first a little apprehensive - website looks great, but a little out of the way in Mongkok.",0
"But when you arrive, the room was great.",0
"Thoroughly modern, great views ,we were on the 31st floor,.",0
The bed and pillows were the best I have slept in.,0
I asked the hotel where to buy the pillows.,0
Only drawback was the extra charge for in-room internet.,0
"However, the 5th floor had a number of internet terminals and most of the time we did not have to wait to use.",0
Service staff were very polite and helpful.,0
Was confused how to get from airport to hotel so emailed the hotel - response was fantastic with detailed maps depending on your choice of transportation.,0
We chose the express bus.,0
"On leaving the hotel, we took a cab to the Kowloon station to grab the airport train ,fast and cheap,.",0
Told them our choice and they registered our names with the bus desk.,0
Easy.,0
The hotel connected to a mall which was convenient as we ate breakfast there and had Starbucks there.,0
"The mall had many restaurants, including a pretty good dim sum ,recommended,.",1
"The dessert place was very good as well ,also recommended,.",1
"The location of the hotel, while initially I had misgivings, is not too bad.",0
Close to the Mongkok MTR so convenient.,0
Also close to the Mongkok East station which we took the MTR to Shenzhen for a day of shopping.,0
Around the hotel are many shopping places.,0
The street for shoes is close by as is the night market stalls.,0
"Also, many snack places if you like street food.",0
"Nice clean hotel, location not great though",0
"I stayed in this Novotel because 1- it is relatively cheap, 2 - of the brand Novotel.",0
I wasnt disappointed.,0
The hotel has a decent lobby and reception.,0
The room is the best feature - clean and spacious.,0
Only one thing the shower doesnt have a lot of hot water - the water was just warm enough to have a shower but not comfortably warm.,0
"Location is really an issue in this hotel, as there is no underground close by.",0
It is possible to walk to the nearest station but it will not be that comfortable if you have luggage with you.,0
The hotel is located in the middle of the hill which makes walking not too easy.,0
Next time when I am in HK I will probably stay in somewhere more central.,0
Calm in the eye of the storm,0
Havent been to NY in 25 years and I forgot how amazing this city is.,0
The tumult of Times Square is behind you the minute you enter the Westin.,0
I found the decor and atmosphere very relaxing in the lobby area.,0
When I arrived on Sunday afternoon I was the only person in the lobby/reception area.,0
"Check in was a breeze however, I was initially given a smelly, smoked -in room facing the river.",0
", even though I was told I was being upgraded,I must say though their response was quick and I was switched to a beautiful room on the 40 th floor facing all the action.",0
"The room was clean, laundry request was excellent but expensive.",0
"The staff was very helpful, concierge was cheerful and patient.",0
Great stay at the Westin,0
I was in town on business and stayed at the Westin for just one night.,0
I came in around 5 p.m. on Friday night and checked in without any problems.,0
"I was a little nervous because my room was right across from the elevators but once I got into my room and saw how big it was and the layout of the room, I knew I wouldnt be bothered by hallway noise.",0
I was on the 38th floor and had a great view of downtown and the water.,0
It really was gorgeous,0
"The room was really spacious with 2 queen beds, a desk and a little sitting area.",0
"After I checked in, I went down to the fitness room for a quick workout and found it to be really nicely equipped.",0
"There are a bunch of treadmills, a couple of cross trainers and a few bikes ,all with individual tv screens attached, and a whole separate area with weight machines.",0
The Westin is really centrally located so I took off to find dinner and found a bunch of places within a block or two of the hotel.,0
"Its also a great location if you love shopping because Nordstrom and Macys are right up the street as well as 2 big malls, Westlake Center and Pacific Place.",1
Everything is within about a 5 minute walk of the Westin,0
The Westin prides itself on its Heavenly Beds and I couldnt agree more with them.,0
That bed was AWESOME,0
I fell asleep fast and woke up feeling really well rested,0
"Saturday morning I got up, worked out, and went looking for breakfast.",0
"Although there are a lot of coffee shops nearby, I decided to head to Pike Place Market and see what I could find there.",0
Pike Place is less than a 10 minute walk from the Westin and is definitely a must see.,0
"Try to get there early though, because this is tourist central and it really got crowded later in the day.",0
"I got there a little too early, as people were still setting up their stalls, but I have never seen such beautiful looking produce and flowers",0
It looked so fresh and delicious,0
I went back to the Westin to pack up and check out.,0
"Check out time is noon, and since my flight was not until 10 p.m. that night, they let me store my suitcase in their luggage storage room.",0
"When I was ready to leave for the airport, I just went to the front and the Downtown Airporter bus pulled right up and took me to the airport for just $10.25 ,$17 roundtrip,",0
Definitely the way to go if youre staying here,0
I really recommend the Westin.,0
"Its a little on the pricey side, but you definitely get what you pay for",0
Great time had by all,0
"We had a 2-room suite in the south point, very close to their awesome water park River Ranch.",0
"On Sat. nights during the summer, they show Dive-in movies at 7:30 p.m - you can watch the movie while in the pool or sit on the deck chairs, complete with popcorn.",0
"We ate from the pool food/bar which was fine, and then at the Hole in the Wall for dinner and then breakfast.",0
It is not that overpriced compared to any full-service hotel.,0
"If you want to purchase the hotel service package for $9, you receive an additional admission to the water park ,we had 4 with our room,, unlimited use of the fitness facility, miniature golf, 2-for 1 ice cream, etc.",0
We will definitley stay here again.,0
Far cry from business type hotels,0
"Stayed for 6 nites , fortunate to be upgraded to Junior Suite, no isssues with room size ,standard rooms noted as small ?,.",0
"Everything about the place is warm, no regular upstarts telling you to get in line.",0
"Whenever we approached the front desk,their offer of assistance always preceded our requests.",0
"Staff warm,sincere,would like to think its deliberate to employ these type of people, because it works",0
"Sometimes in Manhattan the hotels lean to business class or carry the attitude that theres more where you came from, consequently you dont get that personal service.",0
You get it in the Library though,0
"The rooftop bar ,small, but nice outlet after a long day.",0
"Overall smashing hotel, could it be improved ?",0
"Bigger rooms , bar at ground floor, bigger reception, but then it wouldnt be the hotel that it is .",1
"Tinker to improve, yes.",0
"Stay there and enjoy, we did.",0
"P.S Noticed a bar is being added at street level, not sure whether will be hotel run or indepedndent?",0
When it opens not sure what will happen to rooftop terrace.,0
I stayed there on business for 4 nights in early June.,0
"The lobby, the welcome cocktail, the rooms, the dining rooms; everything REALLY above average.",0
"I want to mention specially the attention af the personell, specially Dilcia, Janet, Heidy and Donald at the front desk.",0
Summary: I would stay there again ANYTIME: highly recommendable.,0
"Good sized room, good location",0
The room and bathroom were big - for Europe.,0
"Staff was helpful and nice, breakfast was adequate, free internet access was a nice treat.",0
Location was good for walking.,0
"Walls were a bit thin, but we didnt have any major issues.",0
"Definately would recommend, especially for the price.",0
Not quite the best value,0
I visit San Francisco about twice a year.,0
I try to get the best value for my stay and will always be willing to pay a bit more if I think its worth it.,0
Unfortunately this establishment falls a bit short.,0
I really didnt get a chance to experience the staffs level of service but the rooms are small as is the bathroom.,0
The room was clean and quiet.,0
"However, for the prices that this establishment charges, there are far better values like the Argonaut or right across the street, the Holiday Inn Express.",0
"One other thing, I took my family to the eating establishment connected to this hotel and the service there was TERRIBLE",0
Interior entrance to rooms.,0
BIg stain on room rug.,0
I was a late arrival to hotel.,0
I was charged for 3 nights rather than just 2.,0
Reversed charge without a problem.,0
resturant was ok.,0
Some of the resturant staff rude and obnoxious.,0
Simply The Best,0
We have just returned from six nights at the New York Sofitel.,0
Whilst this is our first Tripadvisor report - our opinion of the Sofitel is based on comparison with a variety of Hotels across four continents.,0
So why has staying at the Sofitel caused us to go into print?,0
Because the Hotel made a great visit to New York even better.,0
We were on the 23rd floor with a great view of the Chrysler Building.,0
The room was a good size with ample space around the bed and a separate seating area.,0
The bathroom had both bath and separate walk-in shower which we consider essential.,0
"Best of all - all the staff are so friendly, informative and helpful.",0
Meals were expensive compared to local eateries.,0
We choose to to eat out for three quarters of the time on the basis of cost and also to experience New Yorkers food,0
but when we did eat in the Hotel we found the food and service excellent.,0
Why was the Sofitel New York so different and so good?,0
"It is very difficult to put into words - we have stayed in many Hotels which provide equally as good rooms, clean beds and showers, a pleasant ambiance, friendly staff and are situated in good locations.",0
The overall experience was greater than the sum of the parts.,0
You will just have to try it for yourself.,0
"The hotel was very modern, clean and ther staff were all very helpful and spoke good English.",0
"On arrival we were given a map and directions to les rambles, the receptionist also told us which streets close to the hotel to avoid.",0
The hotel is close to all the major attractions.,0
"Our room was a good size, very nice and clean and having air conditioning was a major plus.",0
"Overall, we were very pleased with the hotel for the price we paid.",0
Absolutely Beautiful,0
"Let me start by saying Im a 30 year old guy and Im not one of these people that have never traveled before and then come straight home to write a review about how wonderful there vacation was, because lets face it, first time in the Carribean, how could it be bad?",0
"Ive been all over the world, and have stayed in many 5 star resorts.",0
The Gran Melia is world class.,0
"The staff was amazingly helpful, the restaurants were some of the best Ive ever been to in my life ANYWHERE",0
The rooms were absolutely perfect.,0
"Even the beds were top notch with plush pillow top mattresses, down comforters and large down pillows.",0
"If you need to get out and roam, this is not the resort for you, as you are miles away from anything, however there is so much to do right there at the resort I cant imagine why you would need to go anywhere.",1
"If you want to rent a car, rent it at the airport, not the resort",1
"They wanted over $300 for 4 days, and we ended up renting at Enterprise for about $125 insurance included , after driving in Puerto Rico I highly recommend taking there insurance,.",1
Taxi fares are not cheap,0
"To get from the resort to the airport was about 30 miles and cost $80 dollars each way, but remember, youre still basically in the United States.",0
"Wages are the same, and cost of living is very high here unlike most destinations in the Carribean, so dont expect to come here and rack up on some over priced brand name purses, because everything is priced basically the same as in the states.",0
Through the resort you can contact a guy named Angel for some of the best scuba diving I have ever done in my life.,1
"All day tour for about $175 per person, lunch and beer included",0
"Great value, great guy",0
"Oh yeah, Donald Trump is building a couple hundred condos on the same property as the resort ,Dont worry, you dont even know the construction is going on, this place encompasses over 2000 acres,, and Trump also has two 18 hole golf courses ,PGA tour 2008-2011, on the property.",0
"As I said I would recommend this resort to anyone wanting to relax, be totally pampered, and enjoy some of the benefits of the good life.",0
"By the way, I read somewhere that the place was overcrowded with locals paying only a small daily fee to get in.",0
"This is somewhat true, but undestand that these people are paying abut $50 dollars per person for only the use of the swimming pool and a few of the other pleasures of the resort.",0
"A family of 4 cost about $200, so your not dealing with a bunch of out of control kids running around with one adult trying to wrangle them, these people are paying very good money for the day use only of these things, and are not a problem at all.",0
"Oh yeah, the casino is very nice, and drinks thre are always free ,Holdem tournament every Saturday Night,",0
Great location The Hotel,0
"Preciados is centrally located and within walking distance of the major sites in Madrid: Puerta del Sol, Teatro Opera, the Palacio Real, Catedral Almudena, etc.",0
The staff was extremely helpful and was able to answer all of our questions.,0
The rooms were clean and the bathroom was completely up to date.,0
I would recommend this hotel to anyone.,0
We had a wonderful time,0
I had read some of the comments posted here before going and was kind of dreading what I might find.,0
I must say that I was very impressed with the service at the hotel.,0
Everyone we encountered was extremely courteous and friendly.,0
"The hotel decor is very tasteful and trendy, and while the wallpaper may need a tiny bit of work here and there, as has been mentioned before, its really not a big deal.",1
Nor is the hotel filthy or a wreck as some of the reviewers have stated.,0
"Its not in a great neighborhood, but hey, most of New Orleans isnt a great neighborhood and the bums are everywhere.",0
"The hotel is small and so are the rooms, but everything is comfortable.",0
I found that the photos posted on their site are pretty accurate.,0
We had the front desk call a cab for us on our way out to dinner and were offered the hotel car and driver for our return.,0
After a brief chat with the people at the front desk about our anniversary / birthday celebration we left for dinner.,0
When we came back to our room we found a bottle of chilled champagne and a bag of goodies for us to eat.,0
It was such a wonderful surprise we went back down to thank them.,0
We would definitely recommend this hotel to our friends.,0
We had a great time.,0
Poor Service --,0
Relocated to Ohana East This property is now a part of the Ohana and Outrigger family of hotels.,0
This is initially why I booked with them.,0
"However, they overbooked the property when I got there and would only accomodate me in a smoking environment.",0
This surprised me since Ohana has some completely non smoking properties.,0
I thought they were updating their standards.,0
The folks at the front desk were very poor on listening to our needs and were extremely uncooperative.,0
"I finally got the attention of a young gentleman ,Alex, to see the obvious which is just to find me a comparable room with their other properties.",0
It was so easy but the other women at the front desk were horrible on helping anyone and even one tried to be confrontational.,0
"I accepted a reservation at the Ohana East, just around the corner.",0
Read my review and see my photos from that stay.,0
"This hotel was conveniently located, though not on the beach.",0
However..it was in need of some updates and doesnt have a very welcoming atmosphere.,0
But I would start with the hotel staff.,0
"Good vlue, terrible service",0
"OK the value is good and the hotel is reasonably priced, but the service is terrible.",0
I was waiting 10 min at the erception desk for the guy to figure out whether there was a clean room available or not.,0
That place is a mess.,0
"Rooms are clean and nice, but bear in mind you just pay for lodging, service does not seem to be included.",1
"Great service, great rooms, soft towels, good restaurants, great buffet.",0
"In fact, the breakfast buffet gave an American, a Chinese and a finicky 5-year-old great choices.",0
But the location was just unacceptable for a pleasure trip.,0
Now if they could only move the hotel 15km to the northeast....,0
Nice Base for Exploring,0
My wife and I stayed here on a 2-night side trip from Napa.,0
We picked this hotel because of the great deal we received on the internet.,0
"Check-in was a breeze, but the $54/day rate for valet parking was a turn-off.",0
"Call us cheap, but we said no thanks and parked on the street for free since it was after 6pm.",0
"The next morning ,Saturday, at 7am, I walked accross the street to Starbucks for coffee and then moved the car to the Sutter lot.",0
This giant lot is catty-corner to the hotel and charges $32 a day.,0
"Although the Sutter lot does not allow in/out service, we used the savings to buy two, 24-hour muni bus/rail passes and a muni-map.",0
You can get these at the Union Square half-price ticket window.,0
"Driving and parking is such a hassle, I would recommend using the metro.",0
"We went to a Giants game, the wharf, and a concert on the bus/street car and Bart and never waited more than 5-10 minutes for a ride.",0
We had a nice room on the 25th floor.,0
"The room was 4-star, but the lack of services ,e.g. pool, gift shop, make the entire property a 3.5 star.",0
"Still, it was a great value and the location cant be beat.",0
Everything is close.,0
We shopped at Macys and went to Walgreens for our snacks.,0
Both are a block away.,0
The concierge desk in the lobby is excellent,0
"Based on the comments from another reviewer, we also tried Sears Fine Foods ,near Walgreens, for breakfast, and the Starlight Lounge ,atop the Drake Hotel, for drinks and dancing.",0
Both places are highly recommended.,1
The worst thing we encountered was the number of panhandlers downtown and at the wharf.,0
Some of these people are too agressive and spoil the whole experience.,0
Denver does a much better job by discouraging tourists form giving to panhandlers and putting donation meters downtown to help fund the shelters and food kitchens.,0
Difficult to fault,0
Spent 3 nights at St Marie in Dec 2003.,0
Very impressed with rooms for the price paid.,0
The quality of food and service at the breakfast room was fantastic.,0
An Excellent Return Stay,0
A few years had past since my last visit to the Ritz-Carlton Phoenix and I was impressed on how fresh and revived the hotel was.,0
The Lobby has always been elegant but now it sparkled.,0
My room on the Club Level was brand new with a soothing updated look and excellent bedding.,0
Service at the Ritz-Carlton has always been excellent and this stay the staff were at their best.,0
They know I love the fabulous chocolate chip cookies they make--and the night before I left--they had a tray of them sent to my room with a fond farewell written out in chocolate.,0
The location of the hotel is very central--and I look forward to my next stay at the Ritz-Carlton Phoenix.,0
Exceeded our expectations,0
We honeymooned in Hawaii for two weeks the first being at the Hilton Hawaiin Village Resort.,0
What a place.,0
We stayed in the Kalia Tower which is not one better towers but we were thrilled with everything it had to offer,0
First thing we noticed were the meticulously landscaped lawns and gardens.,0
Check-in was quick and very easy.,0
The rooms were gorgeous.,0
Everything you would expect from a Hilton and MORE,0
"We had done significant research on hotels in Oahu and I can say after seeing all the other locations we considered such as Sheraton Moana Surfrider, Marriot Waikiki and many others we were thrilled with our decision to stay at HHV.",0
"Plenty of pool area ,each tower has one and a Super pool in teh middle,, teh property sits ON the beach",0
A beautiful lagoon to take walks along.,0
There were 21 restaurant and 22 stores right on site.,0
Youd never have to leave if you so chose.,0
"Fine dining Restaurants like Benihanna, Golden Dragon ,chinese,, Sergios ,Italian,, as well as Regular eating places like pizzerias, delis, hot dog stands.",0
Shopping was a bit pricey compared to shops a half mile away but boy was the stuff nice,0
I would recommend the HHV only because I dont know how you could have a bad experience here.,0
Think Hilton quality and you will be pleasantly surprised,0
A couple of other places that were comparable but a little pricier.,0
THe JW Marriot Gofl Resort in KoOlina.,0
This place is away from the hustle and bustle of Honolulu.,0
When we go back we will probably stay there to get some variety.,0
We played the KoOlina golf course and it is well worth it,0
We also had the pleasure of going to a hotel called Ala Moana Hotel.,0
Not on a beach but very elegant lobby.,0
No comment on the rooms as we did not see them.,0
If you go to Oahu whereever you stay you HAVE to eat at Aarons in the Ala Moana hotel.,1
The food is great but the service is incredible,0
Not exactly a gem,0
I stayed at the Union Square Hotel for 2 nights in October 2006.,0
"My business trip coincided with a 40,000 person convention and a marathon, so the stay was during a peak weekend and I was lucky to find the room for under $200.",0
"If I had to travel to San Francisco again, I would only stay at the Hotel Union Square if it were again the only place I could find.",0
Heres why:The hotel is old.,0
"Nothing wrong with that, however, little has been done to update the facilities to provide for modern conveniences, save for the free high speed wireless internet.",0
"The water pressure was low, the bed was average, the decor was spartan, and the bathroom was quite small.",0
"A tiny desk was provided which contained a coffee maker, the ice bucket ,along with a few drinks that were for sale, and was also meant to be used as a work space.",0
It was not really useful for anything due to its size and number of functions that it was supposed to perform.,0
"Again, the bathroom was small and the toiletries provided were average at best.",0
"For some reason, I had a bag which included a Harlequin romance novel and a womans razor included in my provided toiletries ,thanks for the free stuff, Union Square Hotel, but Im a guy,.",0
"The location was VERY convenient, both to BART, the cable car lines, and the F streetcar.",0
Many attractions are also accessible just by walking.,0
"If I hadnt been staying during a peak weekend, I would say that was an outrageous rate, however, given the circumstances, Id say it was fair.",0
"For any time of normal demand, Id say that anything less than $120 would probably be a good value.",0
Wont stay here again,0
"This was the third time I have stayed at this property, but this will be my last time.",0
We have had problems each time.,0
"The last time they gave us a room that had been made up to look clean, but actually had dirty sheets and a bathroom that had been used.",0
This time the lights did not work and the remote control had to be replaced.,0
We stayed with a park n fly rate.,0
Even thought the rate was reasonable our car was so dirty we could barely see out the windshield.,0
"They said it would be parked in a garage, but I am not sure that happened.",0
In the past they washed the car before they returned it to you.,0
Also after flying from Montreal we had to wait 20 minutes to be picked up and after returning to the hotel had a wait another 15 minutes to get the car back and we were the only ones there at the time.,0
Oh yes my husband also loaded oour luggage.,0
Half way through someone came over to help since he was looking for a tip.,0
I have also stayed at the Sheraton LAX and it was better.,0
I will not be returning.,0
"Crown Plaza is fine, but beware of parking prices",1
My wife and i stayed at the Astor Crowne Plaza in August 2007 for 2 nights.,0
"The hotel is clean, the rooms were comfortable.",0
But make sure to ask for a high floor if you dont like the noise.,1
This hotel is in the French Quarter not far from Bourbon Str and you can definitely hear the music and noise.,0
"We heard music up until 3 or 4am both nights of our stay, but it really didnt keep us from sleeping.",0
"We ate at Cafe Dumonde ,dont think im spelling it correctly, but ask anyone and theyll know what your talking about,, mostly for its historic aspects.",0
They serve the well-known beignets.,0
"Also, you must eat at Landrys.",1
"Yes, i know its a chain restaurant that you can find in a lot of different states, but something about the one in the French Quarter just tastes better.",0
"Also, there is no on-site hotel parking.",0
You have to leave your car with the valet and the price to have it valetd is $27 per day plus tax and tips,0
"Yes, this was a big surprise to us.",0
We were told that other hotels in the French Quarter charge roughly the same price.,0
We thought a better idea would have been to park at one of the all night parking lots in the French Quarter for $10 to save $$$$.,0
"The difference is with the hotel, you have in/out privileges and its the same price, whereas, if you park you car at one of the lots, once you leave, you have to pay again to re-enter",0
great place for tourists,0
"Thanks, tripadvisor, for making reviews available...I did lots of research on-line to get the best place for the best price for our hotel room in New York.",0
"We had 2 adults and 2 teens in our party, so value was important.",0
"Thanks to your reviews, I was able to eliminate some of my potential choices and to pick the Hotel Metro, where we got a family suite with 2 bedrooms- one for Mom Dad, and one for the teen-age girls.",0
"It was roomy, clean, in a great location; they serve a great selection of breakfast items FREE; and the service we got from the staff at the desk was prompt and very friendly.",0
Also had a fabulous meal at the Metro Grill next door.,0
"If youre picking between this and something a little cheaper, this is WELL worth what we spent...well go back",0
"This was a terrific hotel in all respects--great location, fabulous service, and well appointed rooms ,we got upgraded to a suite which was lovely, very quiet and spacious,.",0
Everything from our arrival to departure went smoothly.,0
"I was surprised to see that the AAA rating on this hotel, along with many others in New Orleans, was only 3 stars.",0
I would have rated it higher and Im very picky about hotel accomodations.,0
I will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and stay again when I return to New Orleans.,0
Outstanding,0
Will probably never stay anywhere else in,0
"Any hotel can have problems, and we ran into a few, but the night manager Shieshedo gave new meaning to the word hospitality",0
"If Oprah knew about the Mr. Steam showers at the Bryant Park, it would undoubtedly make her Favorite things list.",0
"Very trendy, but warm and inviting at the same time.",0
Beds extremely comfortable.,0
Great sound system for docking ipod.,0
"Marble bathrooms have deep soaking tubs,a shower that has a floor to celing glass door with 2 shower heads ,rain shower above, telephone shower mid-range, and a thermostat controlled steamer, allowing you to set time and temp",0
"You can turn on the steam, pipe music into the bathroom and take a cool shower, all the while feeling you are showering outdoors in the tropics.",0
"My son, another aquarian, referred to it as being steam cleaned.",0
"The weather outside was cold and rainy, but the weather in the suites at the Bryant Park was heavenly",0
Do not take the Raymond Hudd suite unless you take both of them,1
"Evidently they recently renovated and were unaware that in terms of noise, it was like sharing a room with your flooormate.",0
",There are only 2 of these suites and they take up the entire floor.,",0
"They are beautiful and spacious, but have hardwood floors, causing the sound to travel easily from one room to the next.",0
It would be ideal if you have friends or family in the other suite.,0
My son and I had the misfortune to be sharing the floor with a couple who had a toddler.,0
"When we called the front desk about the noise factor, the day person told us they did not have another suite and the couple next door was checking out.",0
We came home from the theatre the next night to find a note on our door asking us to keep the TV down because their baby was a light sleeper.,0
",They decided to stay another night.,",0
Evidently mom was not such al light sleeper however.,0
When the baby woke me screaming at 4am I wanted to go pick her up myself it took so long before mom and dad got up to respond to her cries,0
"The next evening we returned from the theatre to find the night manager at the front desk, with whom I had originally made the reservation.",0
He inquired how things were going.,0
I gave him an earful and the next thing I know we were upgraded to the Penthouse suite.,0
It was spectacular,0
Evidently Leo Dicaprios favorite haunt when he stays in New York.,0
From that point on my entire impression of the Bryant Park changed from one of disdain to one of admiration for what they are trying to achieve by catering to a wide range of taste levels.,0
Yes.It is very trendy.,0
I am not particularly drawn to trendy.,0
In fact I could care less.,0
"If thats your thing, youll love it.",0
Dont be thrown by the hip appearance of the staff in black.,0
They are wearing uniforms and are there to to a job and most of them do it quite admirably.,0
"BPappealed to me as a single parent, traveling with a teenage son.",0
I like to come and go unnoticed as though I were walking into the front door of my own home.,0
"The difference being that if the weather was too soupy to go out, I did not feel cheated stayng in the room relaxing until it cleared up.",0
",In fact, upon my return home I started to redecorate my house because I enjoyed the minimalist aspect of the decor at BP.,",0
We only ordered room service once.,0
It was fine.,0
"Did not go to the Cellar bar, but clearly it attracts quite a crowd.",0
We were there the weekend before Halloween.,0
I had no idea there were so many nurses with a night life in New York,0
"I walked past the eager young people hoping to get in, feeling grateful those days were behind me",0
My advice to you is stay here.,0
I researched this trip weeks in advance.,0
My biggest client owns one of the largest chains in the world.,0
I declined to stay at one of their proerties because I wanted something different.,0
New York is a veritable smorgasbord of hotels ranging from sleezy to sublime.,0
I think I have stopped looking when it comes to New York.,0
Going back to Bryant Park would feel like going home to a place of warm memories.,0
Travel these days can bring an untold amount of unpleasant surprises.,0
But the place where you rest your head at the end of your vacation day should bring you peace.,0
I know I can count on that at Bryant Park.,0
",By the way,The same can be said for Sofitel Water Tower,",0
Ps. Cant find the camera.,0
Will upload photos later.,0
"But for a true represenation, go to the five star alliance website.",1
They look exactly like the room we were in.,0
Bon Voyage,0
Boutique Gem in Waikiki Beach,0
"We stayed at Hotel Renew for four nights, December 22 - 26, 2008.",0
"Our overall experience was excellent, and I would highly recommend this hotel property, with one caution that I will address later in this review.",0
The hotel is small --- 83 rooms --- and does not have a restaurant.,0
"However, there is a lovely lounge just off the chic lobby where a hearty Continental style breakfast is served every morning ,included in room rate,.",0
"The breakfast includes fresh island fruits, juices, coffee/tea, pastries, yogurt, and hard boiled eggs.",0
Just enough to start the day,0
"The decor of the hotels public spaces and rooms is modern and sleek, featuring dark woods, light-colored walls, tile and marble bathrooms, and adjustable mood lighting.",0
"Room window are large and can be opened for fresh air, and 25% of the rooms have private balconies featuring a small table and two chairs.",0
The hotel is spotlessly clean.,0
The hotels location could not be more perfect if you dont need to stay directly on the beach.,0
It is one short block from Kuhio Beach to the West and a short block from Kapiolani Park and the Honolulu Zoo to the South.,0
"Because all beaches in Hawaii are public, it is no problem to use the Kuhio Beach or the Queens Beach ,just two blocks from the hotel to the South,.",0
Both beaches offer restroom facilities.,0
The hotel staff is among the best to be found in Hawaii.,0
"Everyone we encountered during our four day stay was attentive, friendly, welcoming, and extremely professional.",0
"From the front desk staff to the bellmen to the housekeepers --- we felt like we were among Ohana ,Hawaiian for family,.",0
The only drawback about the hotel is that the rooms located on the South side of the buidling facing Diamond Head are subject to some pretty terrible noise.,0
"The South side of the hotel faces the delivery entrance of the Resort Quest Hotel next door, and during most daylight hours there are trucks making deliveries.",0
"Of course, if you plan to be at the beach or out touring all day, then the noise is not a problem.",0
"However, if you plan to take an afternoon nap, bring ear plugs.",1
"That said, Hotel Renew is a lovely addition to Waikiki Beach.",0
"If you are looking for a smaller intimate hotel with excellent quality bedding and furniture and a warm, welcoming staff, this is the place for you.",0
Wonderful experience.,0
Close to Bourbon Street.,0
"Rooms were spacious, staff was nice...",0
Will definately stay there again,0
OK in the Oceanfront Rooms,0
"There are some very good things about The Marseilles, #1 being its perfect location.",0
"But of course, since its one of the least expensive hotels in South Beach, its not exactly a high end experience.",0
It is a decent budget option in the right room.,0
"The ocean-front corner room was nice, quiet, spacious and a very good value.",0
It seemed recently renovated with an updated decor.,0
The bathroom is tiny and old-fashioned but was fine for us.,0
"We stayed in a non-ocean front room the first night and were bothered by the door slamming and loud neighbors, which we could not hear once we moved to the ocean-front room.",0
"The first room ,3rd floor, also smelled funny, as did the 3rd floor hallway and the lobby.",0
"The pool, bar area, hammock grove and beach access were great.",0
"Its really good to be able to walk out the back of the hotel and right onto the beach or onto the beachfront walkway for biking or rollerblading, and its rare in SoBe unless youre paying top dollar.",0
"The Marseilles is 2 blocks from Lincoln Road, 1 block from the Delano and 2 hotels down from The Raleigh.",0
The Catalina across the street was a good spot for drinks and for breakfast.,0
"Theres no scene at The Marseilles at night, but thats OK with so many other options all around.",0
"OK Hotel was pretty centrally located - nice rooms, but air conditioning not controllable.",0
I hate that.,0
"Room was ok, but I couldnt change the controls.",0
"It was reasonable on my company rate, very well located for tourist and shopping and was clean and modern.",0
Friendly service great location,0
We stayed for 2 weeks the first time and 10 days the second time.,0
The first time was not long after the hotel opened - October last year and the 2nd was only a week ago.,0
Were off to Perth now.,0
The 1st time we stayed we had what I think was called a standard room.,0
The room was on the small side but very clean and comfortable.,0
None of the other facilites were opened but it didnt matter because you have everything you needed within walking distance.,0
"The 2nd time we stayed we were upgraded to what was called a deluxe room - larger then the room we had before and it also had some other features like tea/coffee, a wardrobe and side tables.",0
"The lounge area was opened and looked great - We were able to get on the internet, cook a meal and also wash some very dirty clothes.",0
The cafe had opened downstairs so we were able to grab something light and easy for breaky.,0
Probably the most enjoyable aspect of both our stays was the staff.,0
Always ready to help or offer advice.,0
One of the housekeeping staff gave us some great tips on what to see in the Blue Mountians and the Hunter Valley - local knowledge really helps.,0
Reception were able to book tours or transport and help with advice on what restaurants to try and what ones to avoid.,0
Overall we think you get great value for money.,0
Reading some of the recent reports makes me wonder what people expect for around $100 bucks a night??,0
If we find some great cheap places we will share it with you.,0
"Clean Hotel, Friendly staff, no complaints",0
"After reading all of the negative reviews, I took a chance anyway and was very pleased.",0
I spent four nights at Diamond Palace Hotel while attending a conference in San Juan.,0
"I saw NO BUGS, the staff was friendly, the hotel was clean.",0
"Its not the Hyatt, Hilton or Ritz Carlton, but its a nice hotel for the price and location, and only one block from the beach.",0
"I had no complications at all with check-in or check-out, and I could see the beach from my room.",0
"I paid $55.00/night ,booked online through a different site,.",0
Theres a Pizza Hut and Walgreens right across the street with many many restaurants up and down the main street in walking distance.,0
Excellent family-run hotel,0
"My wife and I recently spent four nights at this excellent hotel,and it has been an unforgettable experience.",0
"all these things, and many more, make it a relaxing haven to return to after a hot, busy days sightseeing, and all so conveniently close.",0
Just one thing - do not be put off by the rather dark street entrance.,0
"Takethe lift to the second floor, and you will receive a hearty welcome.",0
Good value,0
We definitely recommend it.,0
A Quiet and Quaint,0
The Borgmann Villa Hotel is located right on the magnificent Vodel Park in the Museum Quarter of Amsterdam.,0
Why we were glad that we found this hotel was the fact that we were looking for a retreat that we could come back to after a busy day of exploring the more bustling areas of the city.,0
This was the perfect place to wind down after experiencing all the sights and sounds of Amsterdam.,0
"Tucked into a quiet neighborhood, the 10 minute walk to and from the hotel each day through the gorgeous Vondel Park provided us with a very scenic and peaceful way to begin and end each of our days.",0
We also appreciated the size of our room and bathroom---larger than what we have experienced elsewhere in Europe at this rate.,0
"The owners of the hotel couldnt be nicer or more helpful, gladly answering our questions and making sure our stay was a good one.",0
If you are looking for a place away from the noise and action of the city this is it.,0
where is the lobby?,0
Loved Moskito Boy,0
We stayed at this resort for 8 days and had a wonderful time.,0
The animation team was fantastic.,0
"Walter, Melvin and Maria did a great job of drawng the crowd into the activities.",0
"They always had smiles on their faces, especially Walter who made everyone around him smile.",0
The shows at night were very entertaining.,0
I would recommend this resort .,0
as an aleternative they sent us to a cheap and ugly motel.,0
The lady at the frount desk admited they have been overbooking pepole for some time and that we are not the first to be in that problem.,0
For your own good please stay away,0
No way you can trust what you order is what you get.,0
Not A Golf Resort,0
"We chose this resort because it, supposedly, had a first class golf course very near the resort.",0
We never saw the course.,0
The resort staff told us the local golf course was terrible.,0
"Instead, they push very expensive courses requiring extra transportation costs.",0
Nice resort if you just like the ocean but definitely NOT A GOLF RESORT.,0
"Great Value, watch for noise",0
We stayed a slow weekend in January and got an $80/night rate.,0
"To get a cheap rate, look around online for the lowest rate, then call the motel directly.",1
They will match or beat the best online rate.,0
La Luna could dampen this noise significantly if they were to seal the door so that it fits better in the door frame.,1
This is also a source of cold air.,0
We kept the heater on to drone out the noise.,0
I recommend not staying in room X01-X12 where X is the floor number.,1
Ask for room not facing street.,1
"Another bummer for me was the bed was very soft ,albeit spacious and new,.",0
"Im used to a firm bed, so my back was sore most of the weekend.",0
"The front desk help ,Timothy, when we were there, was very helpful.",0
"Good restaurant recommendations and knew where to find things, in general.",0
"Dont expect much for the light continental breakfast ,nothing fresh,.",0
"Recommend walking two blocks to Judys cafe on Chestnut St. for breakfast ,they only take cash, but good portions of good food,.",1
Close to Union Square,0
"I found this hotel to be a great base, I mean who needs a luxuary hotel, when youre going to be out all day and then just need somewhere to rest your head at night?",0
"Its a 5 minute walk from union square and getting on trolleys etc, near some bars and restaurants and the staff are really helpful and really friendly.",0
"Ok the rooms arent decorated to the best of taste, but it added some amusement to our video diary I would stay here again",0
Terrific Boutique Hotel,0
I selected the Toren based on its location and the previous reviews.,0
"I travelled with my 3 daughters--16, 12 12.",0
"The location was perfect--easy to get to all venues, close to the Canal bus stop, around the corner from the Anne Frank House ,go after 7 pm if you can--no line,",0
Every member of the staff bent over backwards to make us comfortable.,0
"We arrived early, in the rain, and came to the wrong entrance.",0
"Immediately they began to set up the room, adding a second bed in a VERY large room, overlooking the canal.",0
"From house-keeping to reception, they were extremely friendly, professional, and concerned for our well-being.",0
The chef is outstanding.,0
The breakfast buffet was the best that we had during our trip--and we were in 8 different hotels during our stay.,0
I will definitely return to The Toren on a future trip--just with my husband this time,0
"It is very romantic, and the service is just outstanding",0
Thank you.,0
Super Clean,0
"Booked via e-mail, paid 95 euro per night in a double room without breakfast.",0
"Hotel is really superclean, very nice and the helpful staff is very friendly.",0
"We loved our little street-facing room ,the very good windows kept the noise outside, even though it was on the small side, as well as the bathroom and the shower cabin ,overweight people will have problems to take a shower in there,",0
"There is a minibar, a TV and a/c.-The neighbourhood is very french, the two metro lines Nr. 7 and 10 very convenient.",0
"Well definitely stay there again :-,",0
Ideal Spot Great Experience,0
I stayed at the hotel a few weekends ago while in town to attend my granddaughters graduation from Loyola.,0
The hotel is the quintessential bargain for college parents and is in the greatest location - not quite in the french quarter and not too far uptown.,0
"The hotel is located right on the trolley line ,with RTA passes available at the front desk, and the ride to campus or downtown is no more than twenty minutes.",0
The building was characteristically New Orleans and made me feel like I was staying with family or friends rather than at a hotel.,0
"If you are looking for a fancy, corporate Marriot or Sheraton, this is not the place for you.",1
"But if you prefer to stay in a cozy and comfortable bed and breakfast type of hotel, the Avenue Garden is the perfect fit.",1
"The staff was helpful, friendly, and well-informed about the area.",0
I had no problems getting around by myself.,0
My room was spacious and the interior looked very new.,0
Housekeeping was curteous and kept my room clean and stocked.,0
"Overall, I was more than pleased with my experience and would strongly recommend this hotel, especially to those traveling on a budget.",0
recommended by a friend,0
We stopped in Hawaii on our way to and from Australia Dec 2007-Jan 2008.,0
A friend had recommended the Queen based on a stay from several years before.,0
"Although older, the hotel provided a clean and comfortable place to stay for our visit -- a one-night stay going over and several nights coming back from Australia.",0
We were able to get to all of the places we wanted to visit around Honolulu while we were there.,0
The beach was within easy walking distance.,0
Simply - THE BEST,0
"Boy, its going to be tough to write this review.",0
I am not sure I can gush enough about this fine hotel.,0
"When you drive up, the hotel is not overdone, its simple.",0
The hotel sent a car to the airport for us and the car alerted the hotel we were coming.,0
The manager and a assistant greeted us on the sidewalk.,0
"Our check in was done in the room, we never had to stop by the front desk.",0
Then hot tea arrived the room with Asian cookies.,0
The kids had stuffed animals and baseball caps on their beds,0
"We had two rooms, the larger room had a stunning bay view.",0
Our bathroom had a tub that overlooked the bay.,0
I cant tell you how relaxing it was to soak in a hot tub and have the whole city of San Francisco below you,0
This is one hotel I could just sit in the hotel room and never leave.,0
The service is top rate.,0
"You dont have to ask for anything, some how the staff seems to understand what you need and they do cartwheels to make you happy.",0
The staff in my view is one of the best group of hotel employees in the world.,0
The concierge staff is the best in the world.,0
They suggested restaurants and treated the kids like family.,0
We were offered the hotel car for dinner and never had to get a cab to go anywhere.,0
This is exactly what a dream hotel stay should be.,0
"Perfect rooms, wonderful views, attentive staff and San Francisco.",0
I cant describe how perfect our stay at this hotel was....I cant wait to go back,0
"The location is ideal, two minutes walk from the Sagrada Familia and the Linea 5 metro station.",0
The hop on hop off tour buses also stop nearby so for us the location was ideal.,0
"You can reach any part of the city, yet you are far enough away from the hussle and bussle of La Rambla.",0
Altough we had a balcony over the street it was very quiet at night.,0
"The suites were spotlessly clean, modern and fully equipped with two bedrooms, two bathrooms, kitchen with some utensils.",0
"There was however, no coffee maker.",0
Nearby are a host of shops cafes and restaurants.,0
The staff were very helpful and friendly and the buffet breakfast in the relaxing dining room was excellent.,0
We ate out but I would imagine the meals in the restaurant would have been first class.,0
We got a special deal of 200 euros per night and this made the stay even better.,0
The rack rate is 400E which may be expensive if only two are staying.,0
All in all and excellent place to stay and highly recommended.,0
"The shower incidentally was vibrating fine :-,",0
"Lovely staff, great for business",0
I stayed at the Hotel Monaco Seattle during a conference for work.,0
"I otherwise probably would not have been able to stay there for four nights ,it isnt cheap,, but with work paying for it, I got to splurge a little.",0
"When I arrived the first night, it was just in time for their nightly wine happy hour.",0
The woman at the desk let me know there were 10 minutes left and that I might want to swing through there before going to my room to get a couple glasses to take up with me.,0
Yes indeed,0
"The room was lovely; not as big or as posh as pictured, but I also hadnt reserved a suite.",0
The bed was fantastic.,0
"Comfy, plush, great bedding.",0
"The room had its own temperature controls, so I was able to keep it a little on the cool side, which I prefer.",0
The bathroom was clean and nice.,0
"They have LOccitaine products, which I love, so that was a bonus.",0
"They have an ironing board, iron, and hairdryer in each room and many things you can request from the front.",0
But the biggest bonus was the staff.,0
"Every single person was friendly, helpful, and genuine.",0
"I needed to receive and send a fax ... no problem ,and no charge,.",0
"I ordered room service one day ,$28, ouch,,",0
and the waiter was great.,0
The doormen were consistently friendly.,0
The desk staff was exceptional.,0
Makes me wish I could afford to splurge on hotels like this on my own every once in a while,0
The Best in NYC:,0
No need to look further Just returned from a three-day stay over the July 4th Holiday.,0
"I usually stay at a Starwood property like the W when in NYC, but this time I decided to go for a more personal experience.",0
"I went back and forth between the Giraffe and The Muse, finally deciding on Giraffe just a few days before my trip.",0
I definitely was not disappointed.,0
"There were three of us travelling together, my parents ,who were making their first trip to NYC, and me.",0
I booked a Deluxe Double Room.,0
The room was absolutely perfect.,0
"The color pallette in the room was very soothing- soft earth tones, beige, brown, merlot.",0
"The room had two double beds with lovely bedspreads, nice sheets and great pillows.",0
The room had a small balcony overlooking Park Avenue South and 26th Street.,0
Being out on the balcony made me forget a bit that I was in NYC.,0
The bathroom was a nice size and had great amenities.,0
There was a spacious closet and two comfortable bathrobes.,0
There was also a small bar area with a minibar underneath.,0
The hotel gives you two complimentary bottles of water in your room.,0
A very nice touch indeed.,0
The housecleaning staff was very attentive and always turned down the room before we got back in the evenings.,0
"As previously reported, they do provide you with dark chocolate at turndown.",0
The hotel itself is very nicely designed as well.,0
The lobby has walls of windows so it is always very bright and airy.,0
Every employee we encountered at the hotel was very friendly and helpful.,0
"Check in was very smooth and fast, and they gave me exactly the room I had requested.",0
"Personally, I feel the best service the hotel provides is its complimentary meal and snack service throughout the day.",0
"In the mornings, there is a complimentary continental breakfast set up in te lobby.",0
"While it is not a full breakfast buffett, it sure is a nice to have something in your stomach before leaving the hotel.",0
"The spread included bagels, muffins, croissants, danishes, hardboiled eggs, fruit, cereal, milk, assorted juices and fresh coffee.",0
"During the rest of the day, you can also get complimentary water, coffee, tea, milk and cookies in the same area of the lobby.",0
"And, finally, on weekdays between 5 and 8 p.m. they serve complimentary wine and cheese accompanied by piano music.",0
"Even after returning at 11 p.m. from a full day of sightseeing, you can walk over to the bar in the lobby and grab some complimentary water bottles.",0
"For NYC, this was truly an exceptional touch to our stay.",0
The hotel is two blocks from the 6 line subway stop on 28th Street.,0
This hotel truly exceeded my high expections given the reviews on here.,0
I will definitely be returning here next time I am in NYC.,0
Good tourist hotel,0
We recently stayed at the Luna Simone while traveling to London.,0
Our room was downstairs near the breakfast area which eliminated any issue with the lack of a lift.,0
"I thought this was a perfect level of hotel for people who just need simple, adequate accomodations.",0
We spent most of our time sightseeing and found the convenience of getting to and from the hotel ideal.,0
The owners were very nice and helpful.,0
I would recommend to others traveling on a budget.,0
"Additionally, with the weather being cool, we didnt have any issues with the lack of air conditioning, which I could foresee as a problem in the heat.",0
Just try it,0
It is really only a 10 minute drive from all the action.,0
"From the moment we arrived, the staff was very nice.",0
"We came in very late, but our room was ready and it took less than two minutes to check-in.",0
"We had a studio suite and it was spacious, spotless and nicely equipped.",0
"The king bed was truly comfortable and our kids ,5 and 10, stayed on the sofa sleeper and did not complain once.",0
We had a gorgeous view of Mt. Rainier out one side.,0
"There is also a microwave with a free popcorn package, a coffee maker, and a little refrigerator in your vanity area.",0
The hotel is VERY secure....front door locked at 10 pm and a room key is needed to access guestroom floors at all times.,0
"The FREE parking garage ,YES, FREE, is also secured pretty well.",0
"The evening beer, wine and soda coupled with veggies and snacks was really nice and the breakfast in the morning was worth its weight in gold",0
"Scrambled eggs, breakfast meat, cereals, yogurt, bagels, muffins, oatmeal, Starbucks coffee and Tazo teas...all made for a great start-up meal.",0
Just remember to GO EARLY.,1
By 9:00 the place was so crowded we were sitting on the couches to eat.,0
Not many tables,0
We went at 8:15 and it was very nice.,0
The hotel also has a mini general store right in the lobby and their mark-up on items was not bad at all.,0
I think they added about $.85 to a $1.90 quiche from the market up the street.,0
"It is a GREAT little store with drinks, snacks, microwaveable meals, etc.",0
We also partook of the FREE washer and dryer on every floor.,0
That was awesome,0
"There isnt all that much around the hotel to walk to with the exception of Mamma Melenas up the street ,excellent Italian food in a very relaxed setting with superb service,.",0
"The neighborhood was a bit scary at first with a few rundown houses and homeless folks, but it wasnt bad at all.",0
There is even a Trader Joes market nearby and we got some microwaveable stuff for dinner one night and saved a TON of money.,0
"We also tried the Portage Cafe down at the Watertowns sister hotel, University Inn, and while the atmosphere was pretty cool, the service was horrible ,waitress was rude and apparently at the end of her shift, and the menu was mostly organic/health food so it was different from what we are used to.",0
"It was not bad at all, but it wasnt all that great and the prices were a bit high, in my opinion, for a college town eatery.",0
We used the complimentary shuttle downtown to pick-up our rental car and the driver was very kind as well.,0
"My only complaints:1, The cart system, while a great idea, was a bust for us.",0
"We tried to get the movie cart so we could watch a movie ,no DVD players in the rooms, but whoever had the limited number they keep onhand did not return them while we were there so we never got one.",0
They either need to rewrite the policy on the amount of time a cart can be kept by guests or put DVD players in all rooms.,1
We also tried to borrow a movie from the VERY limited DVD collection only to find that the one we wanted and that they thought they had was not in the case and had likely been stolen.,0
"2, One elevator of the two was broken during our stay.",0
"This made for VERY long waits to move between the 5 guest room floors, the lobby, and the two levels of the parking garage.",0
"3, There are no bellman so you do have to move your own luggage.",0
It is on a one way street and there is no driveway or valet or anything.,0
You just have to pull up and get dropped off.,0
"At 10:15 p.m. when we arrived, there was a HUGE tractor trailer with cars on it so we couldnt even pull up in frontI would definitely stay here again if I wanted something a bit less expensive than the giants downtown but clean, comfy, and up-to-date just like the good guys",0
"Caribe Hilton is one of the first Hiltons in the chain, built in 1947, and continually upgraded.",0
It probably needs it again.,0
"Our room, on the Ocean, was, as was mentioned by others, not available until 4PM, which is the guaranteed check-in time.",0
"From 2PM until 4PM, I was told our room would be avaiable in 20 Minutes.",0
This occured 4 times.,0
"We were finally given an alternate room, which did not have as good a view as originally ordered, but was OK.",0
"Room was clean, and the new Hilton comfort bed sheets were very nice.",0
Bed was very comfortable.,0
"Service was very nice, and the beach was awesome",0
"The poolside food was vertually inedible, soggiy cold sandwiches, and watered drinks.",0
"Having said that, I would go back.",0
but please see my review of the Condado Plaza.,0
A Beautiful Deal,0
"My sister and I stayed at this resort from Apr 26 - May 2, this year, 2008.",0
"Oeverall, it was a great experience and we are considering coming back to the Majestic.",0
We still cant believe we stayed at such a beautiful place with such great service for the amount of money we paid.,0
A complete steal.,0
We booked this trip through cheapcaribbean.com,0
It takes about 45 minutes to get there from the Punta Cana airport.,0
"When we arrived ,close to 3pm, our room wasnt ready.",0
I was not happy about this but since we were starving our main priority was to eat.,0
"We went to the Supreme, one of the resorts buffet restaurants.",0
We ate there during most of our stay.,0
We tried two other restaurants but the Supreme seemed to have the most options.,0
We did not try the food in the two reservation only restaurants so I cant comment on those.,0
"As for the others, the food was okay.",0
We had no food related sicknesses during our trip.,0
I tried a lot of different dishes and found that most were okay and a few were really good.,0
My sister who is a picky eater found the food to be good.,0
"I wouldnt come back here if I measured this trip solely based on food but check the other reviews for comments on the two reservation only restaurants ,Le Gourmet and Matsuri, because the food their might be really good.",0
"We spent our days going back and forth between the beach ,absolutely beautiful clear water and white soft, sand, and the pool.",0
"For both the beach and the pool, if you want a chair under a palapa to cover yourself from the sun, I suggest you get their early ,between 8 and 8:30, or before you have breakfast, take your towels and leave them on the chairs you want.",1
This way they will be held until you return.,0
"We didnt always get there early or leave towels on the chairs and we were still able to find palapa covered seating, it just would take a lil bit of walking back and forth and possibly sitting in an area too far from the water or the bar.",0
I simply cannot express how beautiful the beach is.,0
The photos on their website come close but in person it is something else.,0
The pool which goes up and down the length of the resort is so big that at times you feel like it is your own pool.,0
"No matter where you are in the pool there is a bar close-by, not to mention the swim-up bar.",0
All of it is absolutely gorgeous.,0
"They have bridges going across the pool at different spots, just beautiful.",0
"The service, whether being given by the front desk attendant, housekeeper, mini-bar refiller, bartenders, waiters/waitresses, managers, porters, security personnel, or towel attendants, is exceptional.",0
You are treated as though you woke up that morning as Queen Elizabeth.,0
My sister and I are a bit shy and like to keep to ourselves.,0
The bartenders/waiters are so friendly that they ask you not only if you are enjoying yourselves but where you are from and so on.,0
They might have spoken to my sister and I more than others because we speak really good Spanish and this would pique their interest as to where we learned to speak the language.,0
So for most people who are not social anxiety-prone this would not be a problem but instead a plus.,0
"Even though this turned us off a bit ,again for people who dont mind a lil small talk this is no big, we decided that we would still like to come back beacause of the sheer beauty of the resort.",0
"Even if you do not have an ocean-view or poolside room, you are still surrounded by such beautiful gardens and fountains.",0
Please remember to tip the staff.,1
"Theyll give you great service regardless of how you do or dont tip but they are not paid very much, work twelve days in a row with three days off in between, and our tips make all the difference.",0
The great price you will get to stay at this resort should make tipping easier for all.,0
"You will find a lot of Germans, French, and Spaniards visiting this resort.",0
Mainly Europeans with the balance being Canadians and Americans.,0
A lot of families and couples.,0
"Not big with the young, single crowd.",0
If you are young and single you are probably going to want to go off the resort for the clubs.,0
Taxis should make this no problem.,0
"Otherwise, they have nightly entertainment.",0
"A movie at 8pm, a show ,usually a performance of some kind, at 10pm and an on the property disco/sportsbar after the performance.",0
The shows are pretty good.,0
"Whether it is cheesy/funny or just plain good, you will enjoy it.",0
During the day they also have activities you can participate in led by the animation team.,0
The only area of major concern for us was that we overheard a guest being asked to sleep at a neighboring resort for one night because they did not have room for him.,0
This was disturbing because the guest had reservations and were there for a wedding but for some reason there was no room.,0
I dont know if this is a common occurrence when vacationing but it happened to them.,0
"Even with that knowledge the place is so beautiful and they are so nice, I want to go back as soon as possible.",0
paradise found Secrets,0
"Excellence, only a name?",0
"We think not,a first class hotel set in a tropical paradise of luxuious gardens, white sand beaches and swaying palms filled with coconuts",0
"We recently spent 12/9-16 in this resort and if there is a down side to it the only complaint would be that our ceiling fan broke on day 2 and apparently replacement units are hard to come by in the Dominican Republic and so we lived without it for the duration, not in surmountable.",0
"Food, choose from French,Texas style, Mexican, Dominican, Italian, Seafood, or Oriental.",0
Not a bad meal was to be had in any restaurant.,0
"If you go to the Mexican, dont leave without savoring mega amounts of a local topping called pico de gauaio.",1
"We experienced impeccable service, our room was cleaned to perfection each day and our mini- fridge was well stocked an extra dollar or 2 here and there gets you extras such as extra coffee and towels.",0
"Off site tours are readily available through a few select on site tour companies, Apple and Prieto are the 2 that seem to have the biggest following.",0
"We used Prieto, but found the Apple tours to be better organized.",0
"If you go on the Quervo Fun Fun cave tour, it is not for the faint of heart",0
"After a 30-45 min horseback ride there is a good one-hour hike through some VERY rugged terrain of narrow paths, steep hills and very rocky.",0
"The cave itself is gorgeous but take a swimsuit and change of clothes, you will be wet and muddy upon completion of the tour and a video of your adventure is available for a nominal fee on VHS, CD or DVD.",1
"Also worth the price was the Jeep Safari, be prepared for drivers that know not what traffic lights or stop signs are or know which side of the road to drive on assuming the one or 2 roads we were on were even paved.",0
A fun time though and the opportunity to see and get a feel for the local people.,0
"Manati park the last tour we took was also fun, a chance to see some of the island residents of the non-human persuasion.",0
"A cute parrot show along with a horse show was nice but the highlite of the tour was the chance to swim with the dolphins, at the dolphin and sea lion show you have a chance to get a kiss from a very affectionate sea lion a moment you will not soon forget, and they will capture it on film for you, for a nominal fee of course.",0
"All in all, Secrets Excellence is a first rate hotel, with a caring and dedicated staff who went out of their way to make us comfortable and happy.",0
"We would go back in an instant, worth the few extra bucks.",0
A Hit with my Tech Teen,0
My sixteen year old tech-savvy daughter and I spent 3 nights at the Diva while I was attending a conference at the Moscone Convention Center.,0
"From the chromed elevator to the mysterious Murphy bed, the tear drop trash cans and the dimmable light tower, she was intrigued.",0
"The CD cube bedside clock/alarm, the metal mesh chairs and the cute one cup at a time fast coffee brewer all met with her approval.",0
"But best of all in her opinion were the iMacs and free internet access on every other floor, with the Starbucks leading off the front lobby a close second.",0
"I booked a room with a single queen bed through Cheap Tickets and was happy with Divas responsiveness to my e-mail request to give us two beds , they gave us a room with a king and the Murphy bed, both very comfortable,.",0
Check in and check-out were smooth and professional and the front desk people were always happy to call a taxi or help with a question.,0
"Amenities include a tub and heater lamp, A/C and heat, hair dryer, robes and slippers, and complimentary daily newspaper.",0
The room was clean and fresh smelling.,0
"There is an exercise room which we did not use ,got enough exercise on the San Francisco hills,",0
A complimentary breakfast is available but we just hit the Starbucks and then the road each morning.,0
Cons:There was no view but the windows did open for a little fresh air.,0
"My daughter said there were not enough outlets in the room for all the electronic appurtenances we travel with: two cell phone, pda and iPod chargers, curling iron etc.",0
We took the Bart from SFO $4.95 each and walked a few blocks to the hotel.,0
I had a pleasant 15 minute walk to the Moscone Center and my daughter was able to walk Union Square and environs and even up to China Town.,0
All in all we were very happy with our choice and recommend it to our friends.,0
We will definitely stay here again.,0
"There is only one restaurant but the hotel is close to the Hollywood and Highland complex with a choice of restaurants Italian, American, Japanese and sort of French.",0
Large well equipped bedrooms.,0
Twin room means two double beds.,0
Staff were friendly and helpful.,0
"The situation is walking distance to tacky, tourist Hollywood Bvd.",0
Taxis are required for down town and the business district.,0
Must see Getty Centre and the Grove shopping road.,1
"A limo tour of Beverley Hills, Bbelaire and Rodeo Drive starts from Hollywood Bvd.",0
Tip choose a floor above the tenth floor for great views.,1
Hotel breakfast buffet was good value and American.,0
Love the pink palace,0
We stayed at the Royal Hawaiian for two weeks in January 2005 and loved it.,0
It was our fourth stay at the hotel and this hotel has it all.,0
The rooms are elegant and charming with the highest ceilings and the most wonderful hand carved doors.,0
"When we checked into our room we received the most wonderful platter of fruits, nuts and banana bread and a fantastic display of fresh flowers.",0
"We love the pink, the private beach, the whole opulent feel of the hotel.",0
Most importantly the staff were very friendly and polite and the concierge cant do enough for you.,0
We had our three children in a room next door to us and it was a truely magical experience for them.,0
They loved sitting out on the beach in their own private area.,0
We will definately stay at our favouite Hawaiian hotel again.,0
Beautiful on the outside problems on the inside,0
Overall we had a good experience.,0
"However, we would not call this a five star hotel.",0
Our number one complaint is that the hotel room smelled of mold/mildew.,0
We actually had to turn off the air conditioner and leave the door open to get some fresh air.,0
The smell was so strong that we actually brought it back to Boston.,0
We had to air out our suitcases.,0
"Anyone with allergies to mold, I would stay away from this resort.",0
"Also, anyone bothered by a really hard mattress would not enjoy this hotel.",0
It was like sleeping on a board,0
"Also, the resort did not have top shelf liquor.",0
"Other than the frozen drinks, I would not reccommend a mixed drink here.",1
"We are not big drinkers, but do appreciate a well-made cocktail.",0
The staff was friendly and the food was good.,0
"With all this said, we did have a good time.",0
We just think that the hotel does not deserve five stars.,0
We have stayed in several all-inclusive resorts that do deserve the rating.,0
I stay here every business trip to Sydney,0
"Im an HHonors member so stay in Hiltons all over, but this is my favorite.",0
",Tokyo Hilton in Shinjuku is a close second.,",0
I try to book it every business trip to Sydney.,0
"Minimalist modern rooms; motorized blinds, glass bathroom, flat screen TV.",0
This appeals to me but might not be everyones taste.,0
Comprehensive gym in the basement.,0
"The Hilton accepted this without any drama; one staff in the exec lounge was at first unaware of the hotel policy on assistance dogs; one cleaning woman seemed to be terrified of the dog, otherwise Pema quickly become a favorite with the other hotel guests.",0
"Seems people are i, surprised and delighted to see a dog in the lift ii, perhaps missing their own pets.",0
We asked a lot of the staff during the week and they graciously accommodated every request.,0
Professional and personable.,0
great property Great hotel--very detailed.,0
Staff is excellent.,0
Location is great.,0
Only problem was with room service close to closing time of restaurant.,0
Highly reccommend this hotel.,0
NOT BAD BUT........,0
"Sand fleas or ants in room, which I am not a beach person so didnt know if this was normal or not???",0
"Pool was warm, hot tub was non-existent it was covered up or under construction on what looked to be not touched in a long time.",0
"Restaurant was okay, drinks in lobby bar were very expensive.",0
Free breakfast was good and the valet guys were good.,0
The Beach and pool area had bugs that bit me but didnt bother anybody else in our group.,0
Very loud party group down the hall and fire alarm went off in the middle of the night.,0
I phoned the front desk to see if everything was okay and they acted like I was nuts to even ask while being up there 7 floors above.,0
Dont open curtains as you will only view filthy windows.,1
"Wonderful stay, wonderful staff",0
"We arrived at the hotel at 12pm, Eveyln at check in was very helpful but advised that only a room with a king size bed was available.",0
We had booked a double room so we went to leave our bags and explore the hotel.,0
Henry Newmann was at the bag check and immediately found us a room and got our keys.,0
Who could ask for more?,0
I had contacted Henry regarding the hotel using his email address found in other reviews on this site.,0
He had offered me and upgrade from a city vista room to an ocean view during our correspondence and WHAT A VIEW,0
"The refrigerator didnt work, it was found to have a faulty outlet and fixed immediately.",0
"Service and food at the Italian resturant was excellent ,Carolynn at breakfast was full of information and was a treasure,.",0
The gym has exceptional equiptment .,0
Old San Juan was a $15 cab ride away.,0
There were plenty of chairs near the pool and we all won at the casino.,0
Who could ask for more?,0
I would stay again in a heartbeat.,0
"All that I expected and much, much more",0
Simply the Best,0
Beautiful grounds.,0
Clean everywhere - even the beach/pool bathrooms.,0
Food was outstanding - everywhere.,0
Ala cartes as well at buffets.,0
Alcohol was top shelf - try a vodka lime juice,1
So refreshing.,0
Only downside was those pesky chair palapa savers.,0
What time are they getting up???,0
"We always managed to find something and even if it was in the sun, we would take a beak in the shade by sitting on the comfy cushioned chairs sofas that rim the buffet restaurant.",0
"Cocktail, maybe some fruit or the best guacamole you ever had.",0
I would definitely go back.,0
You cant go wrong.,0
Enjoy.,0
The rooms were clean and tidy and the free breakfast each morning was great.,0
Loads of choice and well presented.,0
The staff were always pleasant polite and we would definately recommend the Holiday Inn Express all over the world and stay there again.,0
We choose to stay at HI Exp when we can because they are reasonably priced and include a substantial breakfast and you know exactly what youre going to get because the quality of the hotels are all very similar.,0
"This Hotel differs from the usual HI Exp as it was a little different because of all the old world touches with it being in part of the old Cotton Exchange, rather than a new purpose build hotel like many of the HI Exp.",0
The location was great for all the sights of New Orleans.,0
We would definately recommend it.,0
"Quiet, modern hotel",0
"We loved several things about the Ayre: ,1, it is QUIET.",0
You hear no noise from other rooms or from the hallway.,0
Our room did not face the street.,0
Ask for one that faces the interior.,0
",2, it is clean and very modern in decor.",0
The rooms are large.,0
",3, the hotel left us two bottles of plain water and two bottles of sparkling water every day, for free.",0
",4, the hotel restaurant had a separate area where we could avoid the 15 euro breakfast in the morning and just have a reasonably priced ,and delicious, caffe con leche and pastry.",0
"There are a couple of downsides: the air conditioning works, but not very well.",0
We were never able to get the room much below about 76 degrees.,0
"The hotel is a five minute walk to the Plaza Espanya metro, but there isnt much in the immediate area in the way of shops, restaurants or tourist attractions.",0
"Sometime in the future the old bullfighting arena at Plaza Espanya will be turned into a mall, but for now the only thing you can walk to from the hotel is the hill of Montjuic, which has the art museum, the fountain that is lit up at night, various botanical gardens, various smaller museums, the Spanish Village, and the cable car up to the castle.",0
The rest of Barcelona is really out of reach on foot.,0
"The other thing we did not like is that, although the hotel has free WiFi, if you dont bring your laptop, using the hotels computers costs 6 euros an hour.",0
"Finally, if you stay here, be very careful when going down into the metro and all of the time you stay on the metro.",1
"Even going down the metro escalator steps at a good clip with my husband behind me, someone slipped in between us and opened my backpack.",0
"The petty crime and pickpocketing in Spain is completely out of control: there were three attempts that we know of on us in two weeks, all in or around the metros.",0
Plus we saw a thief on a main street walk into a restaurant and calmly start to walk out with someones camera.,0
We felt more unsafe in Spain than in any other place in Europe.,0
"There is no police presence except at the metro turnstiles, where theyre trying to deter farebeaters; apparently the Spanish police dont care that tourists are being preyed upon.",0
"Put your valuables in a zippered pouch inside your clothing, dont carry a backpack, keep an eye on anything you put down beside you in a restaurant, walk in caravans, dont let people surround you on the metro: make sure you are near an exit door.",1
"Be aware of your surroundings at all times, and you wont be a victim.",1
Good vacation for the money.,0
Great place to vacation.,0
"Plenty of food to choose from, some you may like, some you may not.",0
Can snorkel from the beach area.,0
People are more friendly and helpful than in Cancun.,0
The Bavaro safari runner trip into the countryside will open your eyes as to how good you have it.,0
"If you go on this trip bring items from your dollar stores ,pencils, markers, coloring books, for gifts for these children and watch their reactions.",1
Beach and pool area topless.,0
"Clean , tidy,very helpfull",0
"Rooms were clean , recently refurbished and inexpensive.",0
"This was a pleasant ,safe ,place to stay where the parking was free and yet short walk to Canairie Wharf/cable cars.",0
too much money for oh so little,0
We arrived at this hotel to meet with friends for a long weekend.,0
After an easy flight from JFK we had to wait for over 35 minutes for the hotel bus to pick us up and bring us to the hotel.,0
We arrived only to stand in a line for 20 minutes before anyone told us since we were Royal Sevice Members we were to go to another area.,0
We booked an Ocean front room.,0
"Well, all we saw of the ocean was the roof top of another building.",0
"We were told prior to getting to the hotel that our reservation had been honored, mind you we paid up front.",0
"So they move us to another room garden view on the 1st floor, dark and smelling very moldy.",0
NOT ACCEPTABLE.,0
"We are then brought to another room garden view with 2 small beds, not acceptable for $100.00 a day.",0
Neither was provided.,0
The food was less than adequate.,0
It appears there is one main kitchen.,0
If you like to eat the same food all the time....go for it.,0
The Benihana type restaurant was just a show with everything dumped onto a plate.,0
The bird droppings often found in the Mirador Grill usually found on the plates and tables did not help.....disgusting and certainly not acceptable in the light of the bird epidemic.,0
"The royal service pool was pleasant and very cozy, the staff was very wonderful.",0
The casino there is a bit sketchy.....many of the machines were not functioning properly and the atmosphere was not pleasant....small is not even close.,0
Where was Management?,0
Seems they had a major problem...They were ABSENT.,0
Think twice before spending the money.....we will never return even if it were FREE.,0
There is much better out there.,0
Absolutely Fantastic - finally have found our Sydney Hotel,0
We stayed at Rydges World Square for one night during a quick trip to Sydney.,0
"It was fantastic, and I think weve finally found a Sydney hotel for our regular stays.",0
"Check in was smooth and friendly, the room spotless and quiet, the bed heaven, the bath products really nice, and best of all the location is fabulous - right in the World Square shopping area in Chinatown.",0
Its a short stroll to the best yum cha in Australia.,0
"Im a hyper fussy customer, and cant recommend this enough.",0
Absolutely loved this hotel and its staff,0
From the moment we booked the room we were treated wonderfully.,0
We were getting married in San Francisco and had heard great things about the PA.,0
Our room was upgraded to a Deluxe King w/fireplace.,0
They had champagne and chocolates waiting for us along with 2 teddy bears to keep.,0
"Every single employee treated us as royalty, or better yet as their family.",0
Their breakfasts were wonderful and so was their afternoon wine and cheese.,0
The hotel was so homey and comfortable it was indeed like being in a French Countryside Inn.,0
Our room was delightful.,0
"Many, many thanks to all at the Petite Auberge .. especially, Anna, Mary, Tina, Andy, the day desk clerk whose name escapes me and manager Eric.",0
"These wonderful people and anyone else whose names I didnt get, made this a wedding and honeymoon well never forget.",0
We will be back each year to spend our anniversary with you.,0
Loved our Room,0
This is the first trip my husband and I have taken by ourselves.,0
We have been to mexico 5 times and jamaica and we had the best time by ourselves.,0
We enjoyed the ocean bavaro.,0
We had a beautiful room.,0
The best room we have ever had.,0
I still dont know how we got it but it was wonderful..,0
The food was pretty good.,0
We liked the Italian and mexican speciality the best.,0
The buffets were the about the usual.,0
I am a beach person and I was disappointed.,0
I thought the water would be more blue but it wasnt.,0
It is more of a teal green.,0
It also had some seaweed.,0
So far the riviera maya in mexico has the most beautiful water that ive been too.,0
"Shopping uneventful, it is a pretty poor country.",0
Excellent hotel I booked this hotel based on the reviews.,0
We never met the infamous Storm even though the reviews on his service were the final factor in booking this hotel.,0
The rooms are exceptionally clean and inviting.,0
I do not know about the location and it did not really matter because taxis are readily available and very inexpensive.,0
"This is definitely a four star hotel as noted in China ,trip advisor lists it as a 3 star,.",0
We had no trouble getting anywhere we wanted to go because of the exceptional concergie service.,0
The staff wrote down in Chinese where we wanted to go and numbered each card so we simply handed the card to the taxi driver and off we went each day.,0
"I recommend adding the breakfast to the room charge, the buffet is varied and an excellent value.",1
I highly recommend this hotel and would love to stay there again,0
Great Location for the Price,0
"My friends and I ,3 young women, stayed at this hotel at the beginning of August.",0
"It is on the second floor of a building and really is in great walking distance to the markets, ice cream stores, restaurants, the duomo, uffizi, and the accademia.",0
It is family owned.,0
We felt very secure and safe here as well.,0
Every morning there is free breakfast and very polite assistance.,0
The wife of the hotel owner also speaks very good english.,0
Free Internet is also provided which is great.,0
It is reasonably priced for its location.,0
It also has AC.,0
It is a three star hotel.,0
It was a very relaxing stay.,0
"Among the best, for sure",0
I do a lot of business traveling and found my recent stay at the Grand Hyatt in downtown Seattle to be among the best experiences in years.,0
The decor is modern and relatively new.,0
"My room was spacious and the bathroom had both a deep, clean tub at one end and excellent shower at the other.",0
"Wake-up calls are done by staff and you even have the option when making the reservation for more than one wake-up ,which one of my sleepy colleagues certainly appreciated,.",0
"The location, as already mentioned, is great because of all the shops and restaurants within a few blocks.",0
Even getting to and from the airport was a breeze.,0
I had to leave immediately after my conference and the concierge arranged for a cab to be there waiting for me so I could make my flight.,0
"For me, the best feature of this place is the outstanding service by the staff.",0
"I was in charge of my event and everyone on my staff found the Hyatt personnel to be helpful, cheerful and accommodating.",0
We also all raved about the place and were mad we hadnt left more time to enjoy it.,0
"We all did take a soak in that huge tub, though.",0
"Granted, its on the pricey end if youre a budget traveler, but I think you get your moneys worth if accommodations and service are important to you.",0
Ill definitely be back.,0
48 hours in Firenze,0
This hotel is highly regarded on tripadvisor and this is why we were happy to secure a booking for a late March weekend.,0
"We had a very large and pleasant room on the 1st floor with a kitchen in a cupboard, a table for 2, a nice wide bed and a bathroom with lots of towels.",0
"The location is great, in walking distance of the city center, with a bus stop nearby, should you have sore feet.",0
It was a memorable stay from beginning to end and surely we will come again,0
"Great hotel, great location",0
"A great hotel, with large, clean rooms and attentive staff.",0
Excellent central location made for a really good stay.,0
Would happily recommend.,0
Not Worth the Savings,0
I had a group meeting at this property - the only thing I can say is - dont do it,0
"The hotels air conditioning went out while we were in our meeting, and we were boiling, but they did nothing to accommodate us, or discount the meeting room charge.",0
Get it in writing,0
The carpets in the rooms are stained and drains in the bath-tubs drain very slowly.,0
"The bedding is old, and pillows lumpy.",0
The promised cookies and milk in the evenings did not come as scheduled and the breakfast items were slim.,0
The restaurant on property was ok - but did not bill to your room.,0
"For the location, you are much better off at the Hyatt Regency.",1
Cleaner and safer area.,0
"Nice, but not top quality",0
We found it to be a nice hotel.,0
Everything looks sharp and the hotel is well-run.,0
Roomservices and questions are dealt with quickly by the friendly staff.,0
"This is all good, and the location is excellent.",0
"What was not so good is the fact that you cannot open the windows yourself, and they turned of the airco as it was getting cold outside.",0
"The atmosphere in the room got hot, damp and unpleasant and having to get someone to open en close your window for you is every time you want to do something about it is irritating.",0
"The lighting is a weak point as well, and so is the noisyness between rooms.",0
Good choice for Waikiki,0
My family and I stayed at the Waikiki Parc for three nights in the beginning of January before heading off to Maui.,0
We then returned to the hotel for one more night before heading back home.,0
Overall the hotel is nice and a good deal.,0
It was recently renovated and the hotel property did a very good job.,0
The rooms are nice with some cute modern finishes.,0
We paid an extra $30 for an upgrade to an ocean view room and the view was fabulous,0
I would highly recommend an upgrade for that price.,1
The staff was also very nice.,0
"The hotel has a laundry facility ,which is a great perk,, where guests can do their own laundry.",0
Unfortunately the dryers broke after I put my clothing in the washer.,0
"With a little persuading the manager on site agreed to have my laundry sent out for free, which I thought was very nice.",0
There are a lot of breakfast options in Waikiki and unfortunately Waikiki Parc doesnt really stand up.,0
"For a good breakfast right on the beach check out Dukes ,less than a 5 minute walk from the hotel,.",1
"If youre in the mood to splurge, the Royal Hawaiian ,pink hotel, has a great breakfast but it is pricey.",1
"If youre looking for a reasonably priced nice hotel steps away from the beach, I would recommend staying at the Waikiki Parc.",1
handy hotel for metro.,0
Have just returned from 4 nights at this hotel.,0
I didnt find it quite so fantastic as some of the reviews i read.,0
"The room was very small with an even smaller bathroom,although it had just been refurbished, the air-con unit would blow out air, but not very cold air and therefore never switched off.",0
"Hot water seemed quite a scare commodity, if you washed mid-afternoon you were alright",0
"Having said that, the hotel is in a nice quiet spot, with the metro station only 50 yards away, the reception did speak some English which is always handy.",0
"The breakfast is extra ,8.5euro,not a huge choice, 1 roll, 1 croissant each and some ham and cheese, tea and coffee etc.",0
"Not having stayed in any other hotel in Paris I did not have anything to judge it on, but if we went again i think i would look around first.",0
Poor First Impression,0
We stayed here from the 10th January for 3 nights and the last leg of our Honeymoon.,0
"We had travelled from fiji to Auckland, sat in Auckland airport all day then had a 12 hour flight to San Francisco.",0
We breezed through US immigration and our cases were there as we approached the carousel.,0
For a hotel which is aspiring to great things this attitude is something fundamental which needs to be addressed.,0
"Luckily another staff member intervened and, although he didnt tell us anything different his manner was more acceptable.",0
After a long day we opted for room service in the evening which was very good.,0
"We ate in the Americano on our last evening which was buzzing with an afterwork crowd, the restuarant too was busy, the wine list was good and the food was very good.",0
"We ate in One Market the evening before and to be honest even though it is more expensive would probably opt to eat there again rather than the Americano, theres nothing wrong with the Americano just that One Market just gave that little bit more for your Dollar.",0
"We would stay there again as the hotel, bar and restuarant are all very good lively places, its just a shame that in the last place of our Honeymoon we were greeted by such an abrasive staff member, maybe she should look for a career which isnt customer facing.",0
Add me to the list of those who love this hotel,0
We stayed at the Brooklyn Bridge Marriott for one night before boarding a cruise out of Brooklyn.,0
We booked directly through the Marriotts website many months before and secured a favorable rate using the Senior discount.,0
Arrived around 3 PM and had no problem checking in early.,0
The front desk staff were both professional and friendly.,0
After check-in we moved to the bar for a couple of drinks and found this to be a fun place.,0
"The bartender, Michael, makes a great Manhattan",0
"Talked with the doorman, Nick, who recommended a great dinner spot - the Queen Italian Restuarant.",0
There was 6 of us and he had no problem arranging transportation for our ride there.,0
After dinner we returned to the Marriott for coffee and dessert.,0
"They serve Starbucks and a wicked cheesecake sampler platter ,$13, which easily fed us all - we may not have finished it all",0
Great attentive service as well.,0
The rooms were clean and comfortable and good sized.,0
The bed was very comfy.,0
Very large bathroom and lots of hot water and pressure in the morning.,0
The hotel itself is very lovely.,0
There are escalators from the main entrance up to the lobby and they are surrounded by lots of greenery and flowers.,0
Security is also very evident and appreciated.,0
We enjoyed a great breakfast the next morning in the hotel restaurant.,0
A buffet is offered in addition to the regular menu.,0
Portions were huge and Im not sure any of us were able to finish.,0
Service was extremely friendly but a little slow.,0
Transportation notes: there were 4 of us traveling from JFK with at least 8 bags.,0
We arranged to have Arecibo pick us up - the fee to the hotel was $50 plus tip.,0
"Our doorman, Nick, arranged our transportation to the port and that was $25 plus tip.",0
Hotel Metro Never Fails,0
I first stayed at the Hotel Metro about 8 years ago and over the years have returned when visiting NY either for business or pleasure.,0
"There are so many things right with this hotel, starting with the location ,right in the heart of mid-town, near the Empire State Bldg and Macys in a neighborhood filled with small markets, pubs ,restaurants AND right next to a subway stop, to the price, and of course the wonderful staff.",0
"I particularly like the free continental b-fest of muffins, bagels, cereal and yogurt, and the free gym which I noticed was recently re-furbished.",0
"The bathrooms are not the biggest, nor are the rooms, but this is NY, and how much time do you spend in your room anyway?",0
"I did notice this last time that some of the carpets/fixtures in the room were showing their age but when the price, location and staff are this welcoming, who could argue?",0
I highly recommend Hotel Metro and will likely stay there next time I visit wonderful New York City.,0
Loved the Majestic,0
"My husband and I, along with some friends, just returned from the Majestic Colonial.",0
"After reading the reviews everyday up until the time I left, I was very nervous about staying here.",0
We have been traveling for the past 15 years to the Carribean and I must say this is one of the nicest hotels we have stayed in.,0
"Yes, you must overlook some of the workmanship, but the hotel is beautiful, the pool was awesome and the beach is spectacular.",0
We never had any trouble finding a hut and did not play the towel game.,0
"The staff went out of their way to help you, they are all so friendly, and try very hard to speak English.",0
"If we tried to speak spanish to them, they tried to speak English to us.",0
The food was good for an all-inclusive.,0
"If you could not find anything here to eat, stay home.",0
The steakhouse and the Japanese were the best.,0
"The service was a bit slow at the steakhouse, but give them time.",0
It will improve.,0
"There are people working all over the hotel 24/7, gardening and keeping it clean.",0
You will not be dissapointed.,0
"Go with an open mind, relax, and you will have an absolutely great time.",0
Say hi to the boys at the beach bar,0
"good liquor selection; self-serve, soft-serve ice cream at the outdoor bars.",0
"The Bad: Front desk disorganized ,where do the lines begin??,",0
"Overall: A beautiful resort with a friendly ,except front desk managers, and hard-working staff.",0
"Adequate food, especially if youre not used to 3 or 4-star restaurants and perfer your food to look better than it tastes.",0
"Most people should be able to find what they want...another couple or a group to hang out with, or a quiet corner to sunbathe or read a book.",0
1st Time at the Nikko,0
SF - Excellent,0
Stayed at the Nikko for 3 nights to attend a conference.,0
The lobby is very nice and modern looking with white and grey marble.,0
I had a deluxe king room on the 7th floor.,0
Checked in at 10pm and the front desk staff was very courteous and cheerful and checked me in promptly.,0
My room was not huge but I thought it was pretty good for SF.,0
"It would comfortably fit two people, maybe three.",0
The bed itself was very comfortable and the linens and comforter were impressive.,0
My room had a 42 inch plasma t.v. which was nice.,0
The bathroom was very clean and had a separate shower and tub.,0
Housekeeping was quick to make up the room each day that I was there and were very friendly when I saw them in the halls.,0
"Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel.",1
"It is very close to Union Square, cable car turnaround, SF shopping center.",0
"Gorgeous beach, beautiful resort *Readers be aware:",0
"The post before mine is NOT about the Melia Tropical, another resort entirely.",0
"Having stayed a several all-inclusives throughout Mexico and the Bahamas, the Melia Caribe Tropical was accurately a 5 star.",0
"The weather, the tropical landscaping, and best of all the beach, rank above the others for a winter getaway.",0
"The water is spectacular, looks like a scene from Pirates of the Caribbean.",0
The rooms were nicely furnished -- but be aware this is a country that is not highly accustomed to Americans perfectionist expectations.,0
"You may wait for your luggage, or for any special requests like a replaced lightbulb.",0
"Stow your bathing suit in your carryon, so you can sit by the pool when you arrive.",0
"Staff works on Island Time, not American time.",0
"The restaurants serve on Island Time as well, but there is always the buffet, which was delicious.",0
"The restaurant I liked most offered Thai food, called Pagoda.",0
"The Chef is actually a member of the Royal Thai family, in line for the throne",0
"Im picky when it comes to Thai food, and this met my high standards, and had lovely decor.",0
The Pagoda was also the easiest one for reservations.,0
"Remember to bring comfy walking shoes, the Melia Caribe Tropical is huge",1
My daughter is currently contemplating colleges.,0
"In a misguided attempt to dissuade her from going far away in scary ,to a mom, New York, I took her for a long weekend to the Big Apple.",0
"The Kimberly Hotel was in a great location, the staff could not be more helpful and the rooms were large enough to accommodate a crabby teenager and mother without any fuss.",0
"I highly recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to avoid the giant impersonal hotels, as you will have all the amenities and none of the hassle.",1
Awesome Experience,0
Best Hotel Ive Stayed,0
At in Years This was one of my most relaxing vacations in years.,0
If I had to recommend only one hotel in would be the Affinia Gardens.,1
Great Staff nice reception hour and excellent service.,0
I will be telling all of my friends about the Gardens.,0
Keep up the good work.,0
Fantastic The hotel was truly great.,0
"The staff were extremely pleasant and helpful, the room was very comfortable and quiet and the location was ideal.",0
"If you are going to Barcelona, this is the place to stay.",1
Fantastic Fantastic hotel.,0
"The views from the room were amazing ,even thought it was of a city,.",0
Nice size room for 2.,0
"Only a short walk from Time Sq and Central Perk ,ha,.",0
"Wouldnt return to New York though, thought it was just the same as any other city.",0
"If I did, I would stay at the Millenium Plaza again",0
First Class hotel,0
"After a work conference in Monterey ,avoid the Hyatt Monterey - yuck, my husband and I checked into the Omni for the weekend on the advice from two business traveler friends.",0
We LOVED it,0
"From the moment we pulled up front ,valet quickly greeted us, as parking was part of our $175/night rate, we experienced a very high level of service.",0
"When I approached the front desk, I was warmly greeted and notified that we were already pre-checked in; handed our room key; and offered some afternoon hot chocolate and fresh fruit in the lobby.",0
The room was spacious and smelled beautiful - cant ever remember a hotel room smelling SO floral....but not overwhelming.,0
"Turndown service at night was nice ,Ghiradelli chocolate on the pillow, fresh ice, robes laid out,, and the doormen and valets were extremely helpful with restaurant suggestions and directions.",0
Total Disappointment...,0
Stayed three nights at Sofitel last week.,0
We were underwhelmed with check-in.,0
First night there was no top sheet on the bed only a thin comforter.,0
"We called and a sheet was dropped off for us to make our bed, as there was no housekeeping staff available.",0
"The third night, same deal, no top sheet on the bed.",0
We were too tired to wait so we slept under the comforter that Im guessing is not launderd after every guest - ick.,0
The bed felt broken down and not anywhere near as comfortable as a Westin or Hilton bed.,0
"The lighting in the bathroom was horrible, it made airplane lightening look good.",0
There were hand rails everywhere and two showers so we figured we were in a handicap room.,0
The windows did not open and the room was stuffy and hot.,0
We had to keep the air on high at the lowest temperature to make it comfortable.,0
The room was equiped with ONE small bottle of water and ONE robe and this continued each day.,0
We thought that was a little odd for a king room.,0
"The view was pathetic, it was like a prison view, three concrete walls and the dirty roof top.",0
I guess I had expected more since we had booked this reservation months in advance.,0
The clock radio was not a CD player and it didnt pick up one station.,0
The location is miserable if you are looking for any food or toiletries.,0
We were forced to pay $10 for a bottle of Evian in the bar one night because there is just nothing near by on foot.,0
The location is a little more than a block to the MacPherson subway station.,0
Be advised the subway station does not open before 7:15 a.m. on Saturday.,0
The White House is about two blocks from the hotel and you certainly cant see it from the hotel.,0
With the subway system you are not far from anything in this town regardless where you stay.,0
We asked the concierge if she had a map of Reagan Airports layout and she replied no.,0
That was pretty much the only contact we had with her.,0
"There is one restaurant across the street, a steakhouse, and three tourists on the street advised us not to eat there.",0
"There are three computers near check-in desk that are available to guests 24/7, that was very much appreciated.",0
"However, how this hotel is ranked as high as it is, is a mystery.",0
I stayed in this hotel for a week on a business trip.,0
I have to say its amenities and services were great.,0
"There is a 2 hour cocktail hour everyday from 6-8 where you can get free drinks and snacks, while tipping of course, and breakfast is also free and a huge variety of items to choose from.",0
"The hotel also has a nice hot tub, work out room, and pool in the basement level.",0
They also have business services and currency exchange and a Starbucks on the ground floor areas.,0
"It is also located in the Reforma district and in front of the Turibus stop where you can hop on and take a 4 hour tour of the city for nearly 100 pesos per day or 150 pesos for a 2 day weekend pass, which is well worth it.",0
"The area is also central to many great tourist areas, museums, downtown, and shopping areas.",0
"If you plan on driving, the valet is $8 per day which is comprabable to most 4 or 5 star hotels.",0
"Overall I had a great experience at this hotel and if needing to go back, I wouldnt mind staying at this hotel again.",0
"When we arrived, we climbed the flight of stairs with 100 plus lbs of luggage.",0
"We got to the top, checked in and were placed in the room at the very end of the hall.",0
The walkways are lined with brown outdoor style carpet.,0
"We arrived in our room and even though the hotel is smoke-free, I began wheezing from the mold.",0
The outer rooms are exposed brick and apparently ours was allowing moisture into the room.,0
We checked the bathroom and it also had black mold growing in the 1x1 tiles.,0
I went to the front desk and asked the gentleman if there was some way to check on a refund due to health concerns regarding my asthma and my inability to stay in the room.,0
Fair enough.,0
"He was helpful in saying that he would make a note in his computer system for verification of reasons we couldnt stay, not sure if this actually occured but we will see.",0
Staff seemed pleasant but not very proactive in resolving problems.,0
He didnt offer to have us check another room or to investigate our concerns with the original room.,0
"Fabulous, Friendly Hotel",0
We stayed at the Davanzati the last weekend in August.,0
"From the greeting when we arrived to the help with getting to the train station and goodbyes when we left, it was a wonderful experience.",0
The hotel public areas and rooms are lovely; breakfast is good; and happy hour is just the thing after a day of exploring Florence,0
"However, the best part is the care you receive from Fabrizio and Tommaso from the moment you book the reservation and ask for touring help, to check in and out, to dinner and musuem reservations while you are there.",0
It feels like you are staying at a friends home where they are glad to see you and want you to love their home and city,0
Excellent location Excellent location for main shopping areas and good for using public transport to other parts of the city and airport.,0
The Cartwright has managed to update itself over the years without the lossof its old fashioned charm.,0
"The room we were allocated was on the 5th floor, facing other buildings - not a view at all but lovely and quiet for sleeping.",0
The room was bigger than we expected after reading the reviews and along with the bathroom was very clean.,0
"After reporting the loss of a key , no problems with reception thank goodness,",0
Only down side was with the luxury breakfast - we had real problems getting a seat and juice.,0
Lack of service and nightlife,0
I had very high expectations from what I had read about the resort in the Internet.,0
I soon discovered things were a bit different.,0
"First, the resort is about an hour from the international airport in Isla Verde and transportation is not included to and from the hotel ,$120 round trip for 2 adults,.",0
Restaurants are buffet style and a la carte.,0
A la carte restaurants need reservations in advance and if the place is crowded you wont be able to get any reservation during the whole stay.,0
"I had a good dinner at Bamboo ,japanese, one night but was not able to get in for the rest of my stay.",0
"The buffet style restaurants, Caribeno and Toscano, are disappointing to say the least.",0
"The main bar was enjoyable and the bartenders gave good service while a lady sang spanish songs, enjoyed that very much and tasted a bit of the national culture talking to locals and watching them dance but this was the only nightlife the hotel offered since they have no live bands or dance club.",0
"My biggest complaint was lack of service, employees looked overworked and unhappy, all areas looked understaffed.",0
Concierge was never available during the evening and the front desk was too overwhelmed with guests unable to help us at any time.,0
"There is no free shuttle bus to Luquillo Beach which is about 10 minutes from the resort and simply mediocre nightlife inside the resort and not much too do in the municipality or province of Rio Grande where the resort is located ,you have no choice but to pay a taxi $140 to enjoy San Juans exciting nightlife ,.",0
"Great place, lovable staff",0
"The staff were great, accomodated for everything we wanted.",0
"The hotel is extra clean, and they do everything to make your stay pleasent.",0
Certainly coming again.,0
"Warning, they falsely charged my CC WARNING",0
"After reading ALL of the horrible online reviews of St Vincents Guest House AND hearing a first hand account from a friend who encountered condoms in the hall/stairs, bugs in their bed, urine and other questionable fluids on the walls, we CANCELLED our reservation with several weeks notice.",0
I have my cancellation number.,0
"NOW, today I received my credit card bill and found that this place falsely charged my credit card for a stay",0
"I not only plan on contacting St Vincents, my credit card company, but state and local authorities.",0
This isnt some one time accident.,0
"Read these messages, others have posted similar fraudulent charges to their credit cards.",0
This place obviously has a pattern of pulling this type of scam on tourists and should be closed down,0
This type of thing simply should not be allowed to happen.,0
"They charged the wrong girl, this time.",0
"Convenient, solid, would stay again",0
"A good, solid, basic HI Express hotel right in the heart of Hollywood.",0
"I grew up in LA, but now live in a neighboring county.",0
"Had to get a room for a wedding in Hollywood and this property was available in what I knew was a relatively safe location and was at a reasonable price ,direct from HI website,.",0
"Location: First off, Hollywood itself isnt a real nice place to stay - its sketchy in several areas and not necessarily what many out-of-towners might picture.",0
"This hotel is on a main street, walking distance to Hollywood Blvd and in a safer part of Hollywood than many other hotels.",0
"Room: Very clean, still had a newly built smell and feel to it, which was nice.",0
"Bathroom was well-sized, lots of hot water and great pressure.",0
"Yes, the air conditioning unit is noticeably noisy - I got used to the sound and didnt hear it within minutes, but if you get bothered by this sort of thing its something to note.",0
"Breakfast: Nice, sunny room with plenty of well-stocked items.",0
The service lady who managed the area did a great job of keeping it clean and prepped.,0
We were able to find seating without issue.,0
"Staff: Yeah, the check-in person was aloof ,a young guy, obviously not viewing this as a big career break or anything,, but every single other person we encountered was polite, helpful and smiling.",0
"I especially want to note the cleaning crew, who took the time to acknowledge us with a pleasant and sincere hello or good morning each time we passed.",0
"Parking: $20 for in-out space, with $2 city tax = $22.",0
I dont see the point in this.,0
I think guests should get to park for free.,1
"But, it is LA and free parking isnt typical.",0
"Though, thatd be a nice touch.",0
"Pluses: Theres a little market across the street that was well-stocked, lots of wine, chips, etc.",0
Very convenient.,0
"Hotel is near freeways, so central to getting around.",0
"We didnt ask for it, but got #442 which was tucked in the back with a nice view of Hollywood Blvds buildings.",0
We couldnt hear the traffic.,0
Very good hotel,0
Stayed here in June/06 for 7 nights.,0
Booked online via the official website for a Superior room.,0
"Our rate included breakfast ,2 people,.",0
All hotel staff were very friendly and helpful.,0
"It is a small hotel, so it felt cozy and not as impersonal as a larger chain-type hotel.",0
Our room was very clean.,0
The area is quiet and felt safe; rue Lavoisier is off Malherbes.,0
"Location is convenient - Monoprix grocery/ drugstore is nearby, its a 15-20 minute walk to Opera Garnier and the department stores, 20-30 minute walk to the Champs Elysees.",0
Nearest subway station was St Augustin or Madeleine.,0
"Breakfast was good, especially the fresh-squeezed OJ.",0
"Our room had air conditioning, a small tv in the closet, hair dryer, and a small desk with chair.",0
"Only a few minor issues - no shower curtain in the bathroom, the bed was a bit sunk in the middle, and our window faced another building.",0
"Some other rooms appeared a bit better in terms of size and view, but overall we were very happy with the Laovisier and would stay there again.",0
we stayed at this hotel for a week.,0
they put us in a room for 2 and got two other beds from some other room.,0
no room service and prices for drinks were doubled in price.,0
a soft drink was priced at 3Euro.,0
you can buy drinks from outside the hotel for l.60 euro. bed sheets were never changed during that week and room was never cleaned.,0
"breakfast consisted of bread, 3 different cold cuts and juices so you better be early at the breakfast table otherwise they do not re-stock.",0
"first come, first served basis at breakfast.",0
I strongly recommend to find another hotel rather than staying at the Belfort.,0
Not so bad....,0
This is a complicated place to rate.,0
We stayed at The Globus for two nights in May.,0
There are some great things about the hotel.,0
The staff is very helpful and friendly.,0
"The location is very close to the train station ,easily walkable,, the San Lorenzo market is a block away and everything else is easily walkable.",0
The breakfast is also very nice and plentiful.,0
We stayed in the economy size room which was VERY small but I knew to expect that as the hotel makes that clear.,0
The hotel is very clean but somewhat dingy.,0
There are minor marks on the wall and such.,0
As far as the bathroom and sheets everything is perfectly clean.,0
There was no smell in our room but we were told we could upgrade to a supperior for free.,0
When we went in we immediatley noticed the smell.,0
I am not sure that this is the fault of the hotel though.,0
I think it just may be a sewage problem in that neighborhood of Florence.,0
Avoid the first floor and you will be fine.,1
I am not a small person and the bathroom in the ecomony room suited my needs fine.,0
The walls are not thin.,0
You can let in outdoor noise or block it out with their windows.,0
"Bottom line, it is a great value but it does have some significant problems if you are in the wrong room.",0
"Keep in mind, they are trying their best but in the end it is still a budget hotel.",0
Great location and breakfast,0
Booked through the hotel website.,0
Room was kind of small but we were hardly in it.,0
There is a great makeup mirror for the ladies that pops up from the bureau and you will find the blow dryer there.,0
"Otherwise, there are no outlets in the bathroom.",0
Tea bags were provided in the room.,0
Included breakfast was wonderful.,0
"We filled up each morning on fresh fruits, eggs, dim sum, french toast, potatos, noodles, pastries.",0
There was a small roof top pool which we did not use.,0
Bring a Lan cable for your laptop in the room.,1
Subway is 2 blocks away.,0
We bought an octopus card at the airport for HK300 which included round trip train from the airport to Hong Kong station and 3 days of unlimited MTR rides.,0
"From Hong Kong station, walk underground to Central station and then take the subway to Tin Hau for hotel.",0
"Tips: When you take the tram going back to the hotel, make sure it does NOT say Happy Valley or Causeway Bay.",1
These trams do not go in front of hotel.,0
Victoria Peak at night was an amazing view of the city.,0
There is an 8 pm light show at the harbor every night.,0
Make sure to go to Aberdeen and take a sanpan ride.,1
"We gave US$35 for a ride ,including tip,.",0
Go see the Budda and take cable car either there or back.,0
Bad Service for Up-Scale Hotel,0
The hotel was selected due to the proximity of a convention I attended at the Mascone Convention Center.,0
The staff at the front desk treated guests like robots.,0
Not a very warm reception upon check-in by the staff.,0
Management was rather rude to another fellow union member who wanted to bring in food and drinks for personal consumption.,0
"This is an up-scale, luxury property and not where college frats would stay and have wild parties, but thats how the fellow union member was treated.",0
The elevators where constantly out of service while filled at capacity due to the convention.,0
The best service of the whole stay was from the bell-man.,0
He was the most hospitable of all the staff.,0
Room and bathroom were quite large for European standards.,0
Room was very clean.,0
"Free parking, which is a huge plus in Amsterdam.",0
It is far from the downtown area but not too difficult to get there as long as you arent expecting a 5 minute trip.,0
"We brought our bikes and biked downtown, which took about an hour each way on some nice paths.",0
"The second day, we walked to the metro station ,about 10 minutes, and took the metro to Central Station, which took about 30 minutes.",0
Desk staff was helpful with questions.,0
"Its not a luxury hotel but if you are looking for something a little outside the city, its a good choice and a good price for Amsterdam.",1
A Wonderful Resort GRAN BRAHIA,0
PRINCIPEWe left for Punta Cana Dec 13 out of edmonton.....Concerning this resort I have no real complaints.,0
"As I read in recent reviews there is difinitely a lang barrier if you do not speak spanish, but there is always someone around that does speak english.",0
I was travelling with my husband and step son age 14.,0
We wanted to upgrade so we were closer to the beach.,0
"Pools- Three large pools that everyone can use, one for the upgraded travellers.",0
The water is warm but fairly murky....not nearly as nice as the beaches is Cuba but still goregous.,0
Trips: Only took one trip...Saona Island...This island is breathtaking...a must see.,0
Beware as in the trip info it says that you can go snorkling but no gear is provided so if you want to snorkle take you own gear.,1
For the elderly or overweight it is a task to get in and out of speed boat.,0
The trip was definately worthwhile.,0
Just a few tips.,0
"you dont need a blow dryer one is provided, if you want to buy rum and cigars either get them at the Hotel or go to the factory.",1
