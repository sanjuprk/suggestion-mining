__label__1 Adding this feature will help alot.
__label__0 I tried to play the same remote video via WIFI and iPhone 4 always win Nokia Lumia 920.

__label__1 If I have an app that shows a filtered subset of a user's contacts, I should have a way to click on that user and show the user's details in the native experience.
__label__0 A better implementation might expose a new property or method on MediaLibrary that provides access to a podcast subscription management and episode access object.
__label__0 I've managed to reproduce it using the official MSDN sample and as it's hard to test/debug, I've published a video with the problem: https://youtu.be/_W9S7g-JCQQ If the name of the app is little longer and/or with space inside, then after the OS cancels the background player (not used for some time), it's not possible to reinitialize it by pressing UVC button - the IBacgroundTask.Run method is called twice and without UVC button pressed event.
__label__1 It would be nice to have a similar feature on mobile, except the way it would work would be to add all of the articles to Pocket or an alternative read-it-later app, ""Pocket all"" or something like that."
__label__0 Most even incorporate jump lists into the pinned site icon.
__label__0 What kind of joking?

__label__0 I then proceeded to install WP8 SDK, and to my surprise after it finished installing, touch, pen, and mouse were not operable.
__label__0 The new Geolocator API and implementation is so unreliable, that it can't be used with any confidence in a product.
__label__0 Developers have the choice of looking incompetent or ruthlessly picking a theme & sticking to it, thus rendering the ability to choose an overall theme pointless.
__label__1 Be responsible and give more & specific details, why an app failed rather than pointing a policies which talks about several things.
__label__0 Example: Create a reminder that starts today, ends in month, and reminds the user every Tue.
__label__0 A mechanism that operates like PhoneGap/Cordova would have to be implemented so that access to external hardware APIs can be achieved.
__label__0 Is that in the upcoming roadmap?
__label__0 Flipboard has a awesome way of doing it (but your RSS management is far better !)
__label__0 For me, the benefit would be that when I don't have a microUSB cable handy, I can still dev and deploy to my phone to try something out, or deploy my friend's XAP to my phone w/o having to go find a cable first.
__label__0 We have several dev-centers in 3 countries and extra sales-offices in more countries.
__label__0 The problem may be relevant to HTC HD7 only though, since I have no other device to test.

__label__0 Thanks for reading I hope some of the points I made are clear and can be of help to you and your community :) Thankyou.
__label__0 best regards and a happy new year Karsten Klein from Germany the reminder function in the wp8 calendar must be expand to more weekly options.
__label__0 For instance, texts, contacts (read/write), sockets in listening, real multitasking, etc... We know that you released a super-restricted API to avoid developing apps that could give inexpert users troubles.
__label__0 We have the app on all of the other stores using the same description and keywords and our app shows up with most words that have anything to do with financial planning, such as finance, financial, retirement, etc.
__label__1 I would like the option to schedule my mail synchronization.
__label__0 just as a reference, under win8 using another feed reader, feedly-enabled, and opening the mail app it does import the page so I can mail it out as it is (or if you like, as if I sent it to onenote or evernote as simple article).	
__label__0 I set the background to a fixed color (black)___ more
__label__0 A lot of official apps are almost completely abandoned (like Istragram Beta), but some unofficial clients are really amazing.
__label__0 When techbargain.com updated their site, it no longer worked with feedly.
__label__0 In the Windows store, I can choose trial mode for my app, and then pick the number of days I want the trial to last.
__label__0 And if Microsoft couldn't translate it, it could just copy over the original text.
__label__1 In BYOD concept , block the user from the OS update.
__label__0 This occurs In both classes on WP8.
__label__0 This is the most important feature lacking in WP8.
__label__1 It would be awesome.
__label__0 this implied that background applications in some cas updated costatemete.si presents many notifications have an application that only the logo appears and the number of requests for this application
__label__0 None of my customers understand why they cant just connect the phone to thier PCs and the files are automatically sync'ed to a folder dedicated for this.
__label__0 Even with native code support on WP8 it is very time consuming to port existing libraries to do this.
__label__0 In my old Android calendar is it no problem but in my wp8 is it not possible.
__label__0 Is it possible to put something like Microsoft.WindowsMobile.status on the development of your Windows phone 7.1?
__label__1 It should be an option to remove the "ru" language code from my app 'language History' or an option to completly replace: Fully replace the prevoius(es) xap(s).
__label__0 It would be a great benefit if the developers can manipulate the sdcard resources etc etc.
__label__0 And offers advanced timing and perfect synchronization between animations and sound effects, something very rare even in closed and proprietary software animation formats.

__label__1 remove useless app or the app uses fake icon (e.g.
__label__1 This approach will provide an elegant way of accessing constants both in code and XAML pages in Silverlight, and for my immediate need in Windows Phone 7.
__label__0 I'm sure fixing the phone is easiest, fastest and cheapest!
__label__0 Adding the following four lines to a report, that probably has been sent out thousands of times, would have saved myself more than an hour of searching for an efficient solution and reading: ---------------------- This might help with Dark/Light theme problems: - - (Visibility)Application.Current.Resources["PhoneDarkThemeVisibility"]; or similar - (Brush)Application.Current.Resources["PhoneBackgroundBrush"]; ---------------------- and maybe additional links to documentation It would be much less frustrating for Windows/Windows Phone developers to have hints sent with the certification failed reports, which make it easier to tackle obvious issues that arise because of the restrictions of Windows/ Windows Phone.
__label__0 The majority of apps I see at the marketplace doesn't have any review's.
__label__0 See http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsapps/en-US/2c0cbd51-ae37-4ab7-a3e4-7e1d7cce8643/segoe-ui-italic-looks-bold?forum=winappswithhtml5 for screenshots of this possible bug
__label__1 Mobile teethering (I WOULD APPRECIATE THIS TO BE ON A NEW WP UPDATE FOR WP 8 AND WP 7) BUT 8 WOULD BE FINE 1.
__label__0 When porting my Windows 8 app to Windows Phone 8, I feel that the Universal App template (which is already awesome) could do some other things to increase even more productivity: 1 - Create Pages and UserControl folders: Let's face it, unless we want to create sh**** apps, we won't have the same UI for all platforms, so we'll end up creating the same pages and controls in BOTH versions.
__label__0 On the Windows phone website, my account shows ALL the apps I downloaded, but after resetting my phone, I was forced to remember which ones were useful vs useless...
__label__1 For a phone, hear and function called main, so I need the driver API and identify the data "call", "Recording", ... For example: Get the phone number to call to display information based on the number of phone customers, prepare for new sales transactions over the phone.
__label__1 There It would be better if we havent have to upgrage software via zune.It is timefull and useless.There should be delta upgrades OTA
__label__0 It is extremely poor ""invoice"", no company logo, no company name, no postal code, no company address, no phone number to contact, no tracking (transaction) number, no payment instrument info, no president name, product name doesn't display fully, my name / postal code / address / phone number doesn't display, does Microsoft hire elementaryâè_âè__ more"
__label__0 I don't like comparisons, however all the Windows 10 UWP effort is another attempt to get users into the Windows platform right?Well, you're still missing the point ."
__label__0 If the phone is stolen, and it is password locked, it's still possible to take photos (if enabled).
__label__1 I have a ton of sites saved in my IE Favorites....it would be great to have a search box for the favorites rather than scrolling around.
__label__1 Please provide an API that provides access to the texts to allow developers to implement an application to enable scenarios such as reading or archiving SMS messages.
__label__0 Would make it possible to make calendar viewers that can behave as a real calendar alternative.
__label__0 Right now, I can have several Google apps open in separate tabs in Thunderbird.
__label__0 Right now, there's no easy way to automate their download and parsing.
__label__0 There must be a way to handle this kind of problem, like statistics on how many times an app was started, or not being able to start applications other than some basic apps.
__label__0 I thought the ability to create albums in 'photos' would really help users be more organized in storing their photos.
__label__0 When you create a webview you simply cannot see the DOM or any normal information to see whats going on, what goes wrong and why it goes wrong.
__label__0 when i‚_m on mobile data connection, i get all my notifications, when i‚_m on wifi there is no connection to the push server.
__label__0 In order to display more details on network connection, and to distinguish WiFi networks connected to.
__label__1 so please develop two variants of windows phone OS.
__label__1 Wish there was a way for mails, contacts,calendars etc to be "pulled" from an OWA URL into the email account definitions.
__label__0 I am using a open source API called OpenStack Storage (http://openstack.org/projects/storage/) that requires passing empty headers to remove certain custom metadata entries.
__label__0 That's RATING, not "like/dislike".
__label__1 Its getting annoying.Please fix this.
__label__1 Bing music search should add the ability to learn about the artist and to get the song lyrics for the song it "hears".
__label__0 This Xaml System had it's own serialization/deserialization mechanism in XamlServices class.
__label__0 Ability to block incoming calls & SMS (text messages) from specific phone numbers, within a list configured by the user.
__label__1 Please return to the Windows Phone Dev Center for more information (0x80043001)' message.
__label__1 Please unify the Windows Phone (8 / Blue / 9) and Windows (8 / 8.1 / 9) development compleatly!
__label__0 I'm not happy to implement something which is already there.
__label__0 However, when trying this (ran it on WP 8.1 and WP 10) the user is allowed to leave the password field empty and click on ""Save"", which then returns them to the app's code to handle the token returned.
__label__1 allow sync of ms exchange notes
__label__0 But of course they exist in the store.
__label__1 It would be great to see this circumvented somehow.
__label__0 We used this extensively in one javascript project but would have preferred to do this in XAML - Thereâè_Ü_s a lot of free source SVG files that usable under creative commons on Wikipedia for things like US maps, electoral districts and many other rich features.
__label__0 This just makes me angry as a serious developer!
__label__0 We use Feedly and the Buffer link in a work environment.	
__label__0 User can also choose to run ""everyday, every week, etc"".
__label__0 At the moment, it is impractical for me as a developer to keep asking my boss for his Microsoft account just to create app packages."
__label__0 There has been some discussion on the blog post http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2015/07/30/universal-windows-apps-in-net.aspx?PageIndex=2#comments for supporting F# in the .
__label__1 Please, provide Access to internal too.
__label__0 Built-in browser of Feedly brakes such behavior"
__label__0 I'm using your Chrome app.	
__label__0 App-specific launchers: instead of opening a site's web page, check whether a compatible app is installed or registered.
__label__0 When developing on iOS (using testflight) or Android, we don't have to wait two hours for beta code to be "approved".
__label__1 I'd like to have Feedly automatically detect YouTube videos in feeds, and if I save a post with a YouTube embed, automatically add that specific video to my 'Watch Later' feed in YouTube.

__label__1 Fix Altitude Bug in GeoCoordinateWatcher and Geolocator when using in WP8.
__label__0 I have reported this and nothing has been done about it.
__label__0 You have to be an expert to bootstrap a project.
__label__0 When using Feedly on a mobile device, location information becomes available to the app as well.
__label__0 Recently, there was a change that forced you to use a Buffer account to share to social networks, such as Facebook.	
__label__0 I recently learned how to block the installation of window 10, for example.
__label__0 This is total uncomfortably, i think about give to user, a choose what he want to bind on search button.
__label__1 I feel like this might be easy to integrate with a service that's already up and running like SendtoReader.com OR I would gladly pay $$$ to have the option for Feedly to do it on it's own and send to my kindle."
__label__0 This is also completely secure because the runtime can analyze the class (and it's IL) being submitted.
__label__0 I wanted to delete the extra one but but could not.
__label__0 I hope you will think about it and take a decision in my favor.
__label__1 Please provide design resources in something other than Adobe Illustrator & PowerPoint.
__label__0 From WinRT to UWP, my xaml-generated pdf is not rendering the same.See below the template of my button and the two different renderings.Correct in pages and designer but not when printing it to a pdf.Code: http://s3.postimg.org/cttm2rmjn/buttons_code.png In-app (classic page): http://s3.postimg.org/y27ak710j/buttons_ok.png Xaml pdf printing: http://s3.postimg.org/52cw47ieb/buttons_nok_pdf.png Other strange differences did show up as well - especially in Grids - but the example above is the craziest one.Please tell me if you want some details about other mismatches."""
__label__1 MS Edge is not bad however people have different requirements for web browsers.The current WebAPIs are too limited for developers to create a new browser.You should give people more freedom and more APIs to create new browsers.And please don't always use security risk as excuse for not allowing people to create more creative apps than Edge.I'd like to suggest that creating APIs for: 1, Allowing specify proxies in third-party apps."
__label__1 For example, allowing the user to view the time it would take to reach full charge on USB vs induction.
__label__0 This option is already present in the desktop variant of the app, but missing in the mobile app."
__label__0 Now, I created a universal app.
__label__1 I would like to see an agent like the scheduled task one that can be executed on a specific date and time.
__label__0 BeeLine Reader (full disclosure: I'm the founder) has browser plugins that apply eye-guiding color gradients to make reading faster and easier.
__label__0 This will stay until the parent types in their password.
__label__0 If it were possible to tell the task to show a pin (or pins) at a specific point (or points) that that would allow for a better user experience.
__label__1 Alternatively: provide an API for the submission process so we can at least somewhat alleviate the pain ourselves.
__label__1 It would be very useful to be able to change the names that my apps appear as when I check the App Hub dashboard.

__label__0 I mean we can access system files, registry etc, Like we can do with our PC.
__label__0 A control which allow EASY browser development rather than just loading a page like the current one.
__label__0 I often fiddle with the price of the In-App Purchase(IAP) in my WP app, to try and find the most profitable compromise between price and #of purchases.
__label__1 Allow for default settings so that when this new "defaulting" mode is enabled, clicking the Evernote icon will save with no additional interaction.
__label__0 Like ConnectionSettingsTask, this task permit to open Localization Settings Page from application.
__label__1 I understand why you might do this for the FREE version of Feedly, but i implore you to not mask users custom URLs in your upcoming Paid/Pro version."
__label__0 does nothing other than cause confusion and frustration, and in the case of some people (although hopefully not many, and definitely not me), a reason to leave .

__label__0 What i have noticed is that the Feedly mini toolbar that pops up on the bottom right of web pages, when i want to share the link via that mini feedly toolbar, the background color and the color of the icons (twitter, buffer, etc.) are all the same color.
__label__1 Received from an MVP this week over email: It would be great to be able to have the emulator location data use the NMEA file format - either via file import/export, or using the files directly as a feed.
__label__0 Anyway, Im sure that Im not the only one who has this issue so if we could look at some email invoices it would be great.
__label__0 I hope I can pause or play music on live tiles___
__label__0 Ideally, a company may wish to dedicate a group of Live IDs as testers to be used each time.

__label__0 Moreover, recently GeoTrust claimed us to cancel US registration (current one) and re-register as Russia.
__label__0 Sometimes i have to share parts of messages with others.

__label__0 I have a great app idea going but I am missing one feature, the ability to upload music.
__label__1 As you know, online games and app connectivity are quite popular features these days.I may be overlooking it, but it would beneficial to both devs and Microsoft if Windows Universal apps had access to a universal server for networking apps together."
__label__0 This tester changed the criteria.
__label__0 We cannot download/pay for the apps, submit apps to the store.
__label__1 Well,many country doesn't have visa card availability.So the only way we can have international transactions is via prepaid visa card.So ms should support prepaid card for dev account registration.Or atleast ms should state in the registration form that you dont support prepaid card for developer account.
__label__0 It looks as if the return value of...

__label__0 When you have a lot of sms from your best friend, and you want to delete old messages, you can delete a single message or the entire conversation.
__label__0 Currently if you ever mistakenly selected a "ru" language than you will be in a very bad situation forever: - You can live with the wrong Tile displayed for Russian language in the Store (the english one) or - You can publish an update with the removed "ru" language, but this update will not "fully replace" the old version and you will in truble: 1.)
__label__1 Better than that would be an option to catch the article text and send it completely (not just the resume from rss, as some sites do), somewhat like the instapaper does.
__label__1 We would like a WiFi CSP so we can configure users WiFi - this is useful from an IT tech user perspective.
__label__0 The type of users on gimmebar vs pintrest is night and day.
__label__0 Will you be making that an additional option along side ""open directly in browser""?"
__label__1 A perfect use case for this would be to turn twitter/facebook/etc notifications on and forward those to these email addresses instead of having them clog up my inbox.
__label__0 Hello, thank you for this site.
__label__0 with this mod we can enjoy the platform more the than ever before is to make in the landscape like the upcoming windows 8 or like the original tile home screen from up to down or down to up

__label__0 Right now app titles of more than just a dozen characters or so just get clipped in many places in the phone ui: the marketplace app list, the installed apps list, and inside of pinned tiles.
__label__0 From what I can tell merely starting to play a podcast marks it as read or essentially completely listened to.
__label__0 This feature is available on Android (I heard even on iPhone) An essential and very beneficial feature, that a background task should be triggered at a fixed time selected by the user.
__label__1 The language should be a search critreria for apps and games.
__label__0 I logged out of then back into the Feedly account in Mr. Reader but the folders are still appearing in ascending alphabetical order.

__label__0 Please let me know how to do this?
__label__1 It would be extremely helpful if the reminder/alarm API supported creating a reminder for specific days of the week.
__label__0 Or don't make these objects sealed, so that we can add the needed functionality ourselves.
__label__0 The symptoms are as stated in the title.
__label__1 UWP really needs a way to handle master-details situations easily, maybe something like UISplitViewController offered in iOS SDK
__label__0 Currently only the media library is visible in this way and the access to the media library from app is_æ_ more
__label__1 We would like to know when users remove their company app management from their devices, a kind of Sync ml Checkout message Ability to configure the company app with one click on a link like companyapp://user=foo&pwd=bar&server=contoso.com), then user clicks on it on a mail, sees a warning and accept then it automatically connects to the server The ability to install pkcs12 certificates Add website tiles on the main menu of the phone using MDM Query location using SyncMl commands
__label__1 Add option to hide keyboard: specially when you want to copy a long text.. the keyboard takes around 60% of your LCD space, leaving you with a tiny window to work with.
__label__0 (I tried PowerShell scripts using WMI such as http://www.ravichaganti.com/blog/get-hyper-v-windows-server-2012-guest-network-configuration-using-wmi/ ) See https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/ce23adc6-53a0-44c6-8e75-7b57a33ebe84/uwp-how-to-programmatically-deploy-appx-to-win-10-mobile-emulator?forum=wpdevelop There appears to be no way to deploy an app to a Windows 10 Emulator outside of manually doing so in Visual Studio.
__label__0 The fact that we have to go through C++ to exploit such key resources as DX, D2D, DrawingSurfaces in W8, WPF, WP8 is _NOT_ acceptable.
__label__0 My problem related with Windows Phone Developer Account only.
__label__0 Making it possible to change iso in Video mode.
__label__0 How's that for security?
__label__0 This notification, in my opinion, will make WinPho stills a different OS from Android and iOS.
__label__0 Since this is a Microsoft technology (or, at least, I thought it was), I figured it would work wonderfully on Window Phone 8.
__label__0 The reason I got into this is because I figured If any company could do it Microsoft could and then I find out that I can't.
__label__1 have the possibility to use category of outlook, on wp7 for contact/email/calendar.
__label__0 It will be very easy if the classes are immutable and song collection class can be used simply as a list where one can add or remove Song just like other collections so that MediaPlayer.Play(SongCollection coll) can be used more effectively.
__label__0 gives content creators an additional revenue model.
__label__0 to visit the sites externally for EVERY page is not very convient.
__label__1 Would like to change the view of the contact being displayed.

__label__0 I am thinking about a SDK to allow me to create an "account app".
__label__1 I'd love to be able to export all of my "saved for later" articles to my kindle so I can read it via e-ink.	
__label__0 I just see a blank screen on IE9.
__label__0 I hope to contribute, to a new vanguardist and different operational system in my smartphone.
__label__0 I think there are two ways to improve the beta program: 1.
__label__0 While listening to new music, I want to be able to update/correct song metadata such as title, genre, album, and rating.
__label__0 Maybe a theme that just picks colours from the standard set and distributes them among the tiles that don't have their own colour.
__label__0 one app to look up information in the internet opens up another app that can scan barcodes..
__label__1 Easy access to the Bing Music API would be really useful, especially for apps with artist/song recognition.
__label__0 It seemed like for a few days, Feedly was using Chrome Custom tabs instead of opening links in the external Chrome app.
__label__0 WP8 SDK provides file type association http://utorrentideas.uservoice.com/forums/47263-%C2%B5torrent-for-windows/suggestions/3417415-torrent-file-association-in-windows-phone, please provide the same feature in WP7.8
__label__1 We need a way to save videos to the camera roll.
__label__0 It allows third-party apps to integrate into the People Hub's 'What's New' feed, etc.
__label__0 Weekly or daily email report, as provided by other app tracking platforms, with summary of downloads, reviews and other metrics.
__label__0 I chose Pocket as my preferred saving tool.
__label__0 WM6.1 & WM6.2 has that feature but since WM6.5, the feature has just disappeared...
__label__0 You have to be an expert to bootstrap a project.
__label__1 I suggest these new maximum lengths: title 500 characters, description 10000 characters (same as for app description).
__label__0 I was surprised to find that the, built-in, media player doesn't support the HTML5 video element and live streaming.
__label__1 Provide API to easy save settings of an app online (and restore after unnstall or reset/change phone), using a Microsoft account (http://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-dev-platform/suggestions/3781612-microsoft-account-login) and online service (skydrive/azure ?)
__label__0 It is not at all flexible.
__label__0 Some testers do not understand the criteria for certification.
__label__0 facing problem while I open my app.
__label__0 i can use it to recover my files.
__label__0 the current search in Office only works on titles of OneNote docs, but not their content.. which is not very useful!
__label__1 Hence some reasonable feature should be implemented on App Studio/OneDrive to make this possible.
__label__0 This was great because it allowed other services to get their apps in the store that magically replicated one's camera roll to the cloud service, and allowed users to have a choice as to what cloud service they would use.
__label__0 And this causes me very serious problems: 1.
__label__0 An automated hub for recently used apps would also be good.
__label__0 Would be most appreciated!

__label__1 Controls displaying the SIP when focused should provide a method to close the SIP to ensure data binding is applied.

__label__0 You can add an image but you cant remove it.
__label__0 I absolutely love the Windows Store implementation.
__label__1 Can you get rid of this space to enable more icons to fit to the homescreen?
__label__0 If the user did not have an account configured for that provider, they could be given the chance to create one (or simply redirected to the social network providers website).
__label__0 The idea is that we can develop a regular app and we request our permissions in the manifest, OR the app can ASK FOR TRUST___ more
__label__0 I need to implement a such thing for my own project."
__label__0 in the registration forms using only the keyboard.
__label__1 I wish to add content in Evernote with the clearest formatting I can so it needs to be better than Feedly currently supports."
__label__0 I'm sure it's the app, because exiting it cleared up all the browser response problems.
__label__0 Google Reader allows you to get a public rss feed for each category/label used.
__label__0 7.we want Microsoft to release the updates fast and early.
__label__0 If we need to target corporates then then we would need more APIs for device management, also like Zune (for a single user), we would need an Enterprise Server Application which can control the devices (of employees) remotely where we can apply corporate policies on the device as well.
__label__0 Not everybody uses the Gmail app as default... some others use CloudMagic, Mailbox, Inbox, K-9 and suchÜ
__label__1 Why not add a setting to the inner circle that allows me to turn off the ringtone and let it vibrate only.

__label__0 Unfortunately, in the current situation, I can't have the best of both worlds.
__label__0 Bing doesn't find any for me, the nearest is in Australia, which is a bit far from Denmark.
__label__1 We need to have a way by which applications can register the type of content they handle so that when user is downloading a content using IE, they can choose installed application to open with.
__label__0 AS developing XNA apps in Windows Phone 8 development will not be supported anymore , we sometimes need to have 3d Models and work with them inside application without need to learn C++ & Direct X which will take alot of time and maybe valuable for game developers only .

__label__0 This helps in understanding the timeline for publishing the app.

__label__0 Hello Feedly developers, here is a proposal on how to create a win win situation for readers and content creators.	
__label__0 keyword filtering, deleting articles/authors not of interest, prevent unwanted articles from being grabbed by IFTTT.
__label__0 To get the latest version....
__label__0 If the Phone doesn't have an accurate location, simply return what it does have.
__label__0 But look what happens when i try (note the lower case i) to use the auto-complete, which is set to add a space after being used: it won't subsequently recognise the double space, like so this should be new sentence, but instead i have three spaces.
__label__0 I was fairly disappointed by this.
__label__0 As app developers we are currently stuck with 2 methods of generating revenues 1) one time app payment 2) Ads.
__label__0 Third party apps does not provide accurate direction.
__label__0 =[
__label__0 Using Vodafone GSM and the used data includes Unicode characters thus whole message is failed.
__label__0 Reporting usually takes several days or more than one week until something actually happens.
__label__1 We recommend that you share this deeplink via social media or your website for promoting your app to the public.
__label__1 You can improve this feedback forum by making it work right.
__label__0 But all will not do it.
__label__1 I would like to see a single finger swipe across the entire navigation button area act as an app switch gesture.
__label__0 Windows Phone 8 may have 3 new resolutions, but it only actually has two aspect ratios, 150% scaling and 160% scaling (accessible through App.Current.Host.Content.ScaleFactor).
__label__0 Curently 20 persons max.
__label__0 And in the Windows Store you can flag the App [Requires Trust] for example.
__label__0 Imagine having an installed app do what it does best for another app, such as perform a series of complex calculations or gather weather data.
__label__1 I strongly think that more background color's should be there, like instead of just black and white, have blue, red, green and stuff___ more
__label__0 (I've also posted it over at the WP Community site, too.)
__label__0 I really have no objection to paying for an app if the developer has done an awesome job, but I take offence to the fact there are developers who mislead customers with the promise of something free and only mention the ads and limited functionality etc once you run it.

__label__1 Please make it possible to go to feedly.com or make it possible to download an update from within the extension?
__label__0 the reminder function in the wp8 calendar must be expand to more weekly options.
__label__0 We would like to register as a developer in Windows Store.
__label__0 every 15 sec ONLY when subscribed to Geolocator's StatusChanged/PositionChanged; works fine otherwise.
__label__0 I've got a Win8 app in the store.I want to beta test a win10 version of it.So I set the app to """"Hide & Stop selling"""" I then submit the win10 version and get some promo codes Watching my app analytics, I see *FAR* more devices now have my win10 app than I intended, because *updates* still get pushed regardless of the listing settings!"
__label__0 I'm still waiting and there is no news on Project Centennial.
__label__0 How is it that there is no Check All button for the list of email messages?
__label__0 Adding trial-mode in Windows Phone feels like implement-and-pray.
__label__0 It's so powerful and still human readable.
__label__0 nan
__label__0 It might happen that app can have so many reviews on otherâè_âè__ more"
__label__0 how the quality and useful app can be disappear, gone without any notification ?
__label__0 Microsoft has a RSS Platform for a common store of RSS feeds across IE and Outlook.
__label__0 Adding this API would make room for 3rd-party messaging apps and phone management apps.
__label__0 Not all have international credit card to make payment of $ 99.
__label__0 Sample from my old Bing map application <my:MapLayer Name="AIS_A_Layer" Visibility="Visible" Opacity="0.5"> <my:MapItemsControl Name="A_Tracks" ItemsSource="{Binding AIS_A}" > <my:MapItemsControl.ItemTemplate> <DataTemplate> <my:MapPolyline Stroke="Black" StrokeThickness="1" Locations="{Binding AIS_Track}" Visibility="Visible"> </my:MapPolyline> </DataTemplate> </my:MapItemsControl.ItemTemplate> </my:MapItemsControl> <my:MapItemsControl Name="A_Symbols" ItemsSource="{Binding AIS_A}" > <my:MapItemsControl.ItemTemplate > <DataTemplate> <Canvas my:MapLayer.Position="{Binding Ship.Position}" Tag="{Binding Ship.MMSI}" Tap="Canvas_Tap_A"> <Polygon my:MapLayer.Position="{Binding Ship.Position}" Stroke="Black" Fill="Orange" StrokeThickness="1" Points="0, 0 10, 20 -10, 20 0, 0" Visibility="Visible"> <Polygon.RenderTransform> <RotateTransform Angle="{Binding Ship.COG}" CenterX="0" CenterY="0"></RotateTransform> </Polygon.RenderTransform> </Polygon> <TextBlock Text="{Binding Ship.Name}" Visibility="{Binding ElementName=Map_View,Path=Ship_Name_Visible}"> </TextBlock> </Canvas> </DataTemplate> </my:MapItemsControl.ItemTemplate> </my:MapItemsControl> </my:MapLayer> Today I can't instantiate a Mappolygon in an ItemControl from XAML.
__label__0 This could be used for any of these ""closed"" services which do not offer RSS feeds.
__label__0 Currently this is not possible because when trying to add custom Headers to the content using the below code: HttpMultipartContent mpContent = new HttpMultipartContent(); mpContent.Headers.Add(""Content-Transfer-Encoding"", ""8bit""); we first check to see if the headers which are trying to be added are ""well known headers"".
__label__0 GET IT OFF!
__label__0 It is nearly impossible to edit videos recorded by the phone on the isolated storage, it shouldn't be this hard.
__label__1 Either fix it or make Feedly work always-on without browser interference."
__label__0 The current AdControl crashes any app which uses the silverlight/XNA hybrid mode.No debug data..no stack trace..
__label__0 Issues resulted of mixing technologies that work in different ways, documentation is also 3rd party and may be poor, needs to learn separately, may be removed in the future, different from official documentation, not good at mixing with existing functions of the highâè_âè__ more"
__label__0 Currently UC browser allows us to upload pictures only and so does number of messaging apps.
__label__0 Currently the sorting is: Albums = Title Acsending Pictures & Albums = CreationTimestamp Acesending It would be good if there was more sorting (either via the photo hub or via code) which allows all items to be sorted title\creation timestamp\last updated timestamp ascending\descending.
__label__0 - Sometimes when I seek the video by changing Position property, I've got a trouble with infinite loop of buffering and video never play again.
__label__0 As a web developer, I do not like plugins that add elements to the DOM of each page.	
__label__0 This capability would not only enhance the submission experience, but it would also allow for Store submissions to be added and tracked in the developer's source control system (e.g., TFS, git).
__label__0 Having to deal with physical paperwork (sending it back and forth) is a step backwards... we are living in a digital world!
__label__0 This should flag a feature in the marketplace, when an app is being downloaded, to verify the age of the downloader.
__label__0 Due to some spam emails the phone alerts me about new emails in the middle of the night.
__label__0 It is equal if i use my iPad or my iphone (different provider sim cards) , both are showing me the error that no connection is there.

__label__0 Details: - Handset: Nokia Lumia 1520 - Operator: 3UK - Unstable/zero ceullar data after updating to WP 8.10.12382.878 [Earlier - WP 8.1 update was fine - Data is working fine on wi-fi - Problem occurs when switching to cellular data - Cellular data works for a few minutes, then goes off - IE reports 'Error: cannot find server or DNS error' - Apps just don't work: Facebook reports problem getting data - Cellular data -the icons keep flickering between H and H+ and from 3G to 4G - Toggling airline mode on/off restores data for a few minutes - then -shuts-off - Checked APN settings are correct - even manually added an identical -APN profile, but this seems to have the same effect as toggling airline mode - Selecting 3G as max connection speed seems to help - albeit only very, very marginally - Strangely, even after the data connection is stopped, it will still allow me to access my MNO's home page (Three.co.uk) - as if the network is detecting tethering - Called MNO, but they confirmed there is NO block on my account - Hard reset made no difference, including factory reset - Soft reset made no difference - Not using VPN on the phone - SIM is official NanoSIM from Three UK.

__label__0 Currently, it is not possible for us to release this feature for windows phone, too, and this makes our loyal WP fans frustrated... Hi, I think it's useful if both windows phone 8.x and windows 8.x will have a similar way to access filesystem content and implement ALL the APIs here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh465199.aspx http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh464978.aspx http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.storage.knownfolders.aspx http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/jj218966.aspx In particular, having only the possibility of accessing media files through the XNA API doesn't deliver a UX on par with other platforms.

__label__0 Perhaps a double-tap opens the app like they do now.
__label__0 Which I am able to do on iOS, Android and J2ME platforms.
__label__0 A file manager system.
__label__0 This gives my family up to four LIVE accounts.
__label__0 I appreciate the need reducing wastes of battery power, but if Microsoft believes in putting the user in control, then allow the user to enable access to persistent TCP connections on an app by app basis as Windows 8 allows.
__label__0 private/corporate WiFi authentication with a certificate is not supported at Mango.
__label__0 Please consider adding this type of feature to feedly."
