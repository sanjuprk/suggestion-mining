__label__0 Needless to say, disappointed, it appears I cannot develop apps for WP8 with this computer.
__label__0 I'm using the OnlineIdAuthenticator instead of the LiveSDK because it's API references that I would be able to always show a UI to prompt the user to enter their credentials by setting the "CredentialPromptType" to "RetypeCredentials".However, when trying this (ran it on WP 8.1 and WP 10) the user is allowed to leave the password field empty and click on """"Save"""", which then returns them to the app's code to handle the token returned."

__label__0 How?"
__label__1 Allow debit cards as a payment instrument for registration and renewals
__label__0 Also, the tab does not stay ""unpinned.""
__label__1 In addition to the existing profiler tool, a network activity profiler should be given so that we can analyse network activities that are happening, potentially helping in troubleshooting cases wheter network activites are becoming bottleneck for app responsiveness.

__label__0 I generate a majority of my Google Reader RSS content from manually set up Google Alerts (by setting up Google keyword searches and selecting "Deliver to: Google Reader").
__label__0 Note 3 , lg g2 xperia z1 all have snapdragon 800 and support 4k video recording , why not Lumia phones..
__label__1 Please provide a Quick Menu for Windows Phone - something comparable to Win-x menu in Windows 8(.1) but with possibility to edit and add menu items by the user.
__label__1 A developer would like to ease the app submission process by being able to upload an app submission as a single archive package per submission.
__label__0 I remember, in the beginning, the FB works with this pattern and unfortunately, you abandoned.

__label__0 I might just not be able to find the option so if someone else has anything to add then please comment.
__label__0 It's nice to have a notification from a news for example and be able to read a short extract but it should go further in the experience - dynamic and rich notifications - displayed on a gesture on the left side of the home screen (from edge swipe such as W8.1 does for apps running) - make the lock screen customizable with more than only 5 app and make the icons openable on tap (instead of unrolling the notif center form top) I'm a bit surprise by the Action Center.
__label__1 I want to have access to all single bytes within picture, so I can do with those bytes whatever I want.
__label__0 Currently three additional but unnecessary actions are required to show the downloads history (after '.. Apps updated' was selected in notification center): 1 expand menu bar, 2 select downloads, 3 swipe to history:
__label__0 Since this is a Microsoft technology (or, at least, I thought it was), I figured it would work wonderfully on Window Phone 8.

__label__1 Please allow windows phone 8.1 file/folder picker to have access to onedrive and store the location in futureaccesslist.
__label__0 The store is unusable.
__label__1 I think the new dev center is a great step.What I would like to see is a button on the language description pages that are supported for an app.That would take your default language description and fields and then use Microsoft's Translator to translate all the fields to the language.I spend a few hours at least each time I update the app using online translators and copying and pasting between all of the fields and a online translator.I understand that having a translation is important but I am not a linguist (I honestly think I learned programming before proper grammar), I am a individual person making apps on my own and spending almost a whole day just to post the app descriptions is a big pain."
__label__0 I realize that your link still pings my link and get the analytics, but i have a custom URL for a reason.
__label__0 private/corporate WiFi authentication with a certificate is not supported at Mango.
__label__0 This gives webdevelopers a very easy way to debug their applications and to see what goes wrong (and with IE10 a lot can go wrong, IE11 is better but still not as easy to make cross-platform apps run like on Android and iOS).
__label__0 Please note not all requests can be completed.
__label__0 Not even if the IAPs are completely removed from the app and deleted from the developer account.
__label__0 It is possible to install allowed certificates through the Package.appxmanifest file and then checking Exclusive trust.
__label__0 The only way this would really work well is if it ran in the background like the phone's native phone functionality.
__label__0 I currently use Pocket as my ""read later"" app, but was hoping to move to Evernote."
__label__0 As AES 256 encryption in PDF's is commonplace, the API should be able to support it?"
__label__1 Developers need create/edit document from Windows Store Apps.
__label__0 error report!
__label__0 Microsoft provide a system event SmsReceived for app to be notified when a SMS received, we also need such event for phone call, such as PhoneReveived...
__label__0 There are some apps I only open every month or two but I do want the live tile to be kept up to date.

__label__0 I make Themes for Nokia, Android and blackBerry and If WP7 will have Themes more personalizable like Symbian with a Software to make these, will be perfect!
__label__0 I noticed that Buffer and Evernote each have a keyboard shortcut in the Web interface.
__label__1 Other devices use this format and it would be great to see it supported by Windows Phone.
__label__0 If I say "fatto" vocal command unrecognized!
__label__0 Maybe sending a zip.
__label__0 It's not healthy to keep several accounts that means nothing, specially ones that you just had to create because some service does not allow things like a single renew.
__label__1 If you do not yet, I highly recommend to open ""show print version"".
__label__0 This would mean we could make ad free apps that developers are motivated to keep adding features to over time since they are generating ongoing revenues.
__label__0 Currently, after 30 days of expiration, we can't renew with our original accounts.
__label__0 on newer hardware, they switch to the newer profile.
__label__0 Full unsafe code support would: 1) Allow more code to be shared across platforms, and 2) Increase the performance of applications that needed it.
__label__1 I wish I could simulate multitouch on the emulator (ie: Pinch and zoom) with 2 mice.
__label__0 That can really drive you nuts as there is almost no other web app that does this (Google+ being the stupid other exception of the rule).
__label__0 isn't it better to allow developers to change their app name inside app store according to different language and culture?
__label__1 We need a way to select the word(s) we want to delete
__label__0 Negative reviews are bad, especially when users rated an old version of the app which will then turn down new users.Similarly to iOS, please display current app version and also show the app version of the user reviews in the store."""
__label__1 Please fix this so that it goes back to Inbox (and not exit the app!)
__label__0 I used to get wifi in my whole yard.
__label__0 The few that I follow are for ones where no website exists for them.

__label__1 currently you can only pin an album, but it would be useful if you can pin a single image as a tile.. that way you have easy access to a it.
__label__1 I think Microsoft needs to re-consider about having splash screens.
__label__0 For an app that doesn't require a login, so there's no account to tie the usage to, and doesn't have a natural way to limit functionality, adding a trial-mode feels like implement-and-pray.
__label__0 I apologise if there are better or more appropriate places to post this idea.

__label__0 In Windows 8.1 : - The CameraCaptureUI was shown in full screen - You could take a picture by clicking anywhere on the screen In Windows 10 : - The CameraCaptureUI is shown in a very small window - You have to click on a small button to take a photo How to you intend your Surface Pro users to keep the Surface steady with one hand, while taking a look at the small preview and clicking on a small button with the other hand?
__label__0 So my concern is that what will happen when someone uses only SIM code?
__label__1 Please, add SAP (Sim Access Protocol) Bluetooth protocol.
__label__0 Obviously Not.
__label__0 i could imagine, that in the same way the sms-icon is shown on the lockscreen, a 'mini app icon' is shown aswell, from apps that got notifications (facebbok, whatsapp....)
__label__0 I want to create a app for incoming call recording but WP not provide any API for do this.
__label__0 school schedule, bus route, or a picture of someone you like...

__label__0 Not even as number 11 in the list...) Only 10 elements (or so) is shown, and .... omg, this is just nonsens!
__label__0 This is not about just having more colors in the them colors dialog, but being able, as a developer.
__label__0 This includes deploying in Visual Studio while developing, and using the Application Deployment Tool that is installed w/ the dev tools.
__label__0 Currently, Microsoft.Phone.Info.DeviceStatus is available to know the device manufacturer and it is only accesible from C# project making it a round way about to include this project in C++ ( managed code).

__label__0 The only possibility to create Route is RouteQuery class.
__label__0 Could be very useful if i had the possibility to use an API to automatically Disable the Lock Screen when approaching House or the reverse, Enable Lock Screen when leaving House.
__label__0 It is just not possible to do this at the moment.
__label__0 This is highly restrictive because we can only use the MediaPlayer for foreground applications.
__label__0 (implementing new things for us is always a good thing in my opinion !)
__label__0 I think that has an overall negative effect -user wise, community wise and dev wise.. Maybe you should think about some way to reward those users who take their time to actually try an app and review it.
__label__0 It is used a lot, almost as much as the comma and full stop.
__label__0 Because they would have to be always online and query the online service frequently.
__label__0 Case:- if i mute my phone in any state ringer+ notifications or media+ apps it mutes successfully.. but un-mute function does not works smoothly..restart required to un- mute...2 time observed not always.
__label__1 It would be great if you could share the API with the developer allowing a seamless sync amongst the apps (as it happens now with Google Reader).
__label__1 You can improve this feedback forum by making it work right.
__label__1 need an API to hide cprog.exe and bring other application to front ground
__label__0 make the mapicon of the windows phone sdk 8.1 able to be on top by the use of zindex make the event tapped accessible for mapicon too
__label__0 I understand why this might not have been a high priority, but as the platform grows it seems absolutely necessary.
__label__0 Even if mediaplayer does not contains copyrighted media (phone recorded video), it is not possible to capture its content.
__label__0 This idea could be relatively simply achieved as a new Podcast genre, however that would negatively impact those existing applications which are written with the expectation that all of a user___s genres are musical (other than the Ringtone genre?).
__label__1 Currently Windows OS decides the best Internet connection and uses it automatically (If I have more than one connection like WiFi and Network cable).Need user setting option to override the same and assign one or more app to use specific network connection (WiFi) and others to use other possible network connection (3g/4g).This way the already paid for (3g/4g, WiFi, Network cable, etc.) or for that matter I can take more than one provider's internet with variable speeds at home and connect to one PC and use it optimally/efficiently."""
__label__0 You get to choose what video you like and it plays over and over again,the trick is to not notice the end and the start of the video,easiest to do on waterfall videos...
__label__0 Thanks for consideration!
__label__0 The NMEA 0183( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NMEA_0183 ) is a serial, ASCI, sentence based protocol which is supported by almost all GPS out there now.
__label__0 Pinch and zoom out and scroll through slides.
__label__0 This also gives the___ more
__label__0 I think we could provide valuable feedback and come up with exciting scenario's for using this framework.
__label__0 Like, your Facebook News Feed could be a feed on Feedly.
__label__0 And offers advanced timing and perfect synchronization between animations and sound effects, something very rare even in closed and proprietary software animation formats.
__label__0 There's one area where Mango is a retrograde step when compared with NoDo : theme support.
__label__0 through 'freetext'), and rival platforms such as Android and iOS can exploit SQLite's full-text support, so WP7 is currently at a disadvantage.
__label__0 I want to log a complaint on unequal developer treatment by DPE East Africa.
__label__0 You have to take screenshots in one language, change it to another, wait until emulator reloads and so on.
__label__0 That has at least 2 disadvantages: 1 more work to do for programmers (always check if user has changed the language and notify the webservice so it can change Toast messages 2 if user changes language and dont start app, there is no way of notifying the webservice that is has changed, so user will get wrong language toasts.. Change it to a localizable mechanism please
__label__1 Add an option to customize the size of Pictures uploaded to Skydrive or send via mail.
__label__0 So far i have tried three different apps and I cannot access my pre windows phone 8.1 photos.
__label__0 One of the very popular alternatives to iGoogle is netvibes.com.
__label__1 in addition to the current Alphabetical view, add Sorting options like: Sort by last installed, Sort by recently accessed.. Also it would be nice to have a shortcut screen like the fullscreen blue alphabet tiles, but with dates: 1 day ago, 1 week ago, 2 weeks ago...
__label__1 Further, extend background agent player to play not only audio tracks but Song as well, Thanks
__label__1 Create a better more fluently flowing weed strain app with better pictures and 3-D spinning pictures available too.
__label__0 The best of the best would be to have a DrawingContext on the MapControl :-) with DrawLine etc..
__label__0 Some apps don't work in background well.Downloads may breaks when apps switched.For example, it's better that browser can load a page while i'm switching on another application."
__label__1 Please Combine All Windows Phone SKDs into one installation File, so people download only one file and then check each version of WP SDKs that they want to install.
__label__1 For security reasons, I'd really like to see an option that if the high quality backup via wifi is enabled and if the phone is not currently connected to wifi, then the phone automatically creates resized (smaller) photo and uploads it via data to the cloud and then delete's the resized photo from the phone.
__label__0 Nevertheless there's one thing that annoys me
__label__1 Make it so the tiles can be see through and the background can be a background image, that would look nice 8.
__label__0 But unfortunately, this is application wide, and so all certificates of all services of websites that might be called in the app must be included."
__label__0 Email for business is very impotant!
__label__0 I have a ListView with Grouped items.
__label__0 Extend the API to query phone volume and vibration settings, maybe even set them.
__label__0 This is not available on UWP.
__label__0 UPNP and UDP Multicast is___ more
__label__1 The RSS markup of these feeds identifies the author (e.g. "dc:creator"), use that to set the author attribute for the Evernote note?
__label__0 The screen lock also interrupts or prevents app deployment.
__label__0 The non-english marketplaces are filled with apps that support only english and it is hard to find apps in my native language.
__label__0 For example with regards to controls there is no real explanation of their behaviour.
__label__0 Some wanna use fully unlocked Windows Phone 7 for fun.
__label__1 please make bookmarks for podcasts persistent after moving to another podcast and coming back.
__label__1 I request we are able to have full customization capability.
__label__0 I was expecting some notification center on the site so that i can see what new things have happened over my account since my last visit.
__label__0 HOWEVER, apps with in-app purchases are not eligible to be transferred.
__label__1 Seeing as SplitView is a control used to divide content between and pane and content area, it would make sense for SplitView to allow a PanePlacement.Top and PanePlacement.Bottom in addition to its current Left and Right parameters.
__label__0 Instead, an app developer must re-implement all the podcast management functions that are already well handled by the device and the PC Zune software.
__label__0 When developing on iOS (using testflight) or Android, we don't have to wait two hours for beta code to be "approved".
__label__0 every 15 sec ONLY when subscribed to Geolocator's StatusChanged/PositionChanged; works fine otherwise.
__label__0 Often, this kind of item needs to see all pages so that it can perform a limited task such as looking for RSS feeds that you might want to subscribe to.
__label__1 Please allow the access to Gmail's Todo list sync when a google account is added on the windows phone.
__label__0 Security is a concern and in this case that means access to data or performing undesired operations.
__label__1 Please give us the means of turning this feature off.
__label__0 If we can hold payouts we could hold them until we reach a reasonable amount and then pressing ok to pay out if you are allowed.
__label__0 This will present with more options to subscribe to."
__label__0 Plz plz unlock it.
__label__0 I do not wish to leave it out there.
__label__1 Build support for bullets and numbering into the Paragraph class with properties something like this NumberStart int, -1 = inherit from previous run NumberStyle enum {None, Bullet, Arabic, Letter, Roman} NumberFlags enum flags {UpperCase, DottedLevels} NumberLevel int Make NumberStyle default to None and all this is non-breaking.
__label__0 Right now you can upload an unsupported certificate or even self-signed cert and apphub will not provide any feedback.
__label__0 When I get home I see that my home system is running v14., but I can't get to feedly.com regardless of what I do because the plugin knows better than me.
__label__0 artist image ....
__label__0 Like XE5 from Embarcadero, get Visual Studio to create IOS and Android apps.
__label__0 This could be implemented via WiFi, of course (since Zune does wireless Sync already), or even Bluetooth once we get Bluetooth data transfer ability.
__label__1 If you do not yet, I highly recommend to open ""show print version"".
__label__0 It's been over four years since that post from Shawn Oster, it's time to get this into the platform.
__label__1 It would also be nice to have to deploy only one package to the marketplace but only the needed bits would be tranfered.
__label__1 Allow the BackgroundAudioPlayer to play tracks from the MediaLibrary.
__label__0 The current version of your Chrome Web App does not behave correctly.
__label__0 Currently, some of the RSS items are lists of links.
__label__0 When a developer opened a developer account, Microsoft doesn't issue business invoice for registration fee.
__label__0 From http://moderncpp.com/ "Modern is a Standard C++ language projection for the Windows Runtime.
__label__0 With the windows phone store it was possible to have a beta version of the app.With windows apps, it was not (and nobody ever got why!).
__label__1 The trial feature should be built-in with automatic enforcement, user prompting, disabling, etc, just as it is in the Windows Store.
__label__0 Apps can't show the traveled route at real time on the map (like jogging apps).
__label__0 Like on twitter, sometimes we cant follow during viewing a profile.
__label__0 There is no such option to delete the beta app from dashboard.
__label__1 Either fix it or make Feedly work always-on without browser interference."
__label__0 For this cost, a company would receive two unlocked WindowsPhone devices that could be traded or upgraded.
__label__0 If you think that which users have buy your Windows Phone 7 with contract they can misuse it then Please left them and unlock that phone who has buy Windows Phone 7 without any contract and have factory unlock(Here factory unlock means that phone which can accept any SIM) If you think that if you unlock Windows Phone 7 then which users don't have sufficient knowledge and by mistake they can corrupt/delete system files, In this case i wanna suggest you that you can make Windows Phone 7 fully unlock option, Means if any user want to unlock Windows Phone 7 then he/she can unlock it.
__label__0 I find myself having to manually tab out get figures, enter them in.
__label__0 Your app is published and can be found here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/announcements-for-windows/9wzdncrfj323.
__label__0 Windows 8 phone.
__label__0 The problem is of following nature: as i amreading a long corespondence mail, with multiple reply to all's, when i press the "back" button, screen goes black, does not go back to mailbox view.
__label__1 3.- Share variables between applications in something that could be called "Desharrapamientos" instead of "IsolatedStorageSettings".
__label__1 It would be extremely helpful if the reminder/alarm API supported creating a reminder for specific days of the week.
__label__0 Cons: 1.
__label__0 With Swype, you can type much faster.
__label__0 This can allow the phone to be used as a secondary display or project the screen contents on for example Push2TV devices or Widi Receivers
__label__0 Discussion request for commenters: Visual Studio accepts bugs for Windows Phone at https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/ -- is being able to file WPDev bugs here sufficient?
__label__0 Which I am able to do on iOS, Android and J2ME platforms.
__label__1 Have the app available in the for Lion OSX in the app store.
__label__1 Please add this simple and extremely helpful feature.
__label__0 Please fix this.
__label__1 Add 2 more properties for gridviews controls.
__label__0 In addition this storage may have integration with contacts to allow user have geographical map of his contacts.
__label__0 Perhaps these two ideas are combined and you define which action to take when creating/updating the tile... Flip the tile, execute a background task (or both), or simply launch the app like normal (possibly with deep toast.)
__label__0 UX is much better and
__label__0 Here is where you will leave your feedback https://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-universal-windows-platform/category/81608-dev-center-store Our dev team will review your feedback and ifâè_âè__ more"
__label__0 It's not currently possible to access the wireless radio in ways that would be useful for auditing a wireless network.

__label__1 To close an app the user should be able to use her/his finger to flick it upwards WebOS style.
__label__0 There is no possibility to choose a specific port number.
__label__0 I have a valid phone, with it's own Microsoft Account I have a valid developer account (with another ID) I start up the Windows Phone Registration app, and no matter which of the two above entities I enter, I keep on getting the pesky error 'Device not registered with Marketplace.
__label__0 A secondary start hub I can use to store occasionally used apps would be good.
__label__0 or to identify amount of network transfer.
__label__0 Now uninstalling apps also is not of much use....a reset needs to be done.
__label__0 My internet explorer has stopped working
__label__0 Currently the option to do so is not present."
__label__1 Please remove that validation or validate according with my tax plan and not my country in the account.
__label__0 I am from Russia, and bing don't work here.
__label__1 Default tags would also be helpful -- even better, configurable content keyword tagging would be great!"
__label__0 This also gives the false impression that your app is not good even though you know that people worldwide are enjoying (or not enjoying) the app.
__label__1 I understand the reasoning for not allowing the user to have access to the Mailboxes in the phone, but there should be an API to enumerate through accounts and get their statistics, like the number of unread emails, number of important emails, and the total e-mail count.
__label__0 The current version of your Chrome Web App does not behave correctly:; When you click the icon of a Chrome web app this should bring an existing, open window or tab to the front or in case of a window minimize it into the Chrome Launcher or maximize it from there.; Feedly's web app, however, keeps on opening a new window or tab everytime you click on it.
__label__0 For me, it actually provides a worse experience than the builtin browser, it brings Chrome to the foreground and opens the link I tapped in a new tab.
__label__0 This is a missing feature since windows mobile.
__label__0 It seems particularly bad on 4G - and if I limit connection speed to 3G it helps a little.
__label__0 I had to hold power button with volume down button in order to shut device off and reboot.
__label__0 We cannot download/pay for the apps, submit apps to the store.
__label__1 If you guys employed a .NET module like imageresizing.net on your hosting clusters, you could reduce it to 2 screenshots per actual screenshot per language by only submitting WXGA and 720P images, and then autoscaling the WXGA images down to WVGA through an image handler.
__label__0 It shows up in the store as ""JL Planner.""
__label__0 Secondly, we have many versions of the same application deployed to different customers.
__label__0 I keep reading that that's possible, but can't find any setting or even anyone explaining HOW it's done.
__label__0 On the WinPho8.1 video, it works like Android and iOS.
__label__0 The new Geolocator API and implementation is so unreliable, that it can't be used with any confidence in a product.
__label__0 The engineering team can solve this issue if they do one of the following: 1.
__label__0 Why only APPS, Pictures, Music & Videos can get saved to SD card?
__label__0 It's annoying to have Acrobat auto-open a useless bookmark listing (one entry) in the reading window because it decreases the visible screen real estate devoted to rendering the PDF.
__label__0 Is this maybe a typo in the documentation?
__label__0 I rarely use Google Plus, but there are few very interesting people using it who's post I'd like to read.	
__label__0 Here is my desktop configuration: - CPU: i7 2600K - Memory: 8G of RAM - Harddisk: 1TB - 100GB for Windows - 900GB for Data I'm using Win 10 pro x64 and having problem when saving a 150MB mp4 file from my smart phone to desktop.
__label__0 Tab version have a small number of users, I need to upload new universal package to the phone version app.
__label__1 Put back all games in games folder
__label__0 Instead, it saves the initial RSS item.
__label__0 There is practically no documentation on how classes, class clusters and sub-systems should or do work.
__label__0 Hi, forcing all WP8 apps upgraded to WP81 to behave differently on resume is causing me massive headaches.
__label__1 Trial feature should be built-in with auto-prompted and disabling, just like the Windows Store.
__label__0 I often post to both from Feedly, but this requires a lot of logging in and out.
__label__0 At the beggining of an audio, a bump is heard.
__label__0 The documentation on the Windows.Phone.SocialIntegration namespace is also limited.
__label__0 The problem is we can't put try/catch everywhere and we would like to understand crashes but without a stacktrace it is difficult.
__label__0 I recently bought a Nokia Lumia 1320 and when i tried to sync my contact with hotmail contact, i receive the following error message "80072f30 this contact couldn't be updated on server" Appreciate your idea on this
__label__0 http://yves.vg/testcases/ie_mobi/keyup_event.html
__label__0 It would be real help in increasing user experience
__label__1 Problem is thereâè_Ü_s no way to easily manipulate this within a XAML app - I would hope that an SVG-renderer element would use similar hardware acceleration that the HTML5 renderers use - I would not expect to use javascript/css classes to manipulate SVG from a XAML app but bonus points if XAML styles could be plugged in - Manual conversion to XAML is an extra step in the workflow and leads to duplication of assets.
__label__0 I've two apps with same name, one is in phone and the other one is in desktop.Now, I created a universal app."
__label__1 Make a Chrome packaged app for Feedly please.
__label__0 In some countries this does not work via provider services.
__label__1 Allow us to query device information from a 100% native C++ application so we are not forced to use C#.
__label__0 open up to more platforms to make this phone actually works with the project my phone feature
__label__0 gives feedly an additional revenue model.
__label__1 Companies like CSHTML5 (http://cshtml5.com) and DuoCode (http://duoco.de) are already doing this, but it would be great to see this effort officially adopted into the Microsoft Universal Windows Platform.
__label__0 Generate revenue for Microsoft through selling the application in the app store 2.
__label__0 ability to make simple applications on the phone and then publish them to the marketplace would be appreciated.
__label__1 android has the pull down notification area well we should have a live tile where all notifications come in so if ur using an app n its not pin to ur start screen u can still know when u have a notification.
__label__0 Microsoft wins.
__label__1 It should be possible to deploy a UWP app inside the Edge browser as opposed to the App Store.
__label__0 I have cribbs about the lack of file transfer over bluetooth but the inability to play video and game sounds through a bluetooth headset is very, very lame..
__label__0 If the launcher isn't possible, a property would be useful for disabling/enabling buttons that start the launchers.
__label__0 Just a simple switch that says to the OS, during quiet hours only use vibrate mode to alert me of a call or SMS breaking through.
__label__0 often I have to make dates that returns 4 weeks on Friday or two weeks on Wednesday.
__label__0 None of my customers understand why they cant just connect the phone to thier PCs and the files are automatically sync'ed to a folder dedicated for this.
__label__0 Currently I'm developing an app for posting photos to a user's Picasa account.
__label__1 Please implement file upload API for Internet Explorer, so we can upload PDFs, Docs (from office hub), Images and Videos.
__label__0 nan
__label__0 This burns Microsoft time as well as developer time.
__label__0 Is there any way Microsoft could integrate this into the next version of Windows Phone?
__label__0 It's OK for small business but what about bigger one?
__label__1 The Lockscreen text attribute should be separated out from Tile attributes.
__label__0 I've noticed it happens when the tile shows birthday events.
__label__1 Can you bring in my twitter feed and know which one's I've already read?
__label__0 Do you not have the proper agreements in place?
__label__0 This problem also happen randomly.
__label__0 Bluetooth playing audio is very limited.
__label__0 Now it shows 5 recent items which makes it unusable
__label__0 Adding this API would make room for 3rd-party messaging apps and phone management apps.
__label__1 Daemon service should be turnable on and off per app basis, in the same way like periodic tasks.
__label__1 would't it be great to add albums to SkyDrive and stream them directly from there.

__label__0 I can add my Tumblr blogs to my groups to read them but if I want to like them, I have to open the page in another browser window.
__label__0 We use Microsoft Expression Encoder to do live, smooth streaming, video feeds.
__label__0 This will stay until the parent types in their password.
__label__0 It's a minor thing, but for someone who follows a lot of tumblr blogs, it can get annoying.
__label__1 why shouldn't I as user be able to see reviews made by people from other countries??
__label__0 When browsing a site with RSS and ATOM metadata header, the Chroma and Firefox plugin presents a "transparent button" to quickly and easily allow you to add this feed to Feedly.
__label__0 The file is not removed from storage.
__label__1 IMDb should open to the "Star Wars" page directly from bing's search results.

__label__0 Feedly always inserts "quotation marks" in posts to Buffer.
__label__0 In India lot of students buy Notebooks with Windows 8.1 SL (Not pro).But for developing and testing Windows Phone apps we need Windows Pro version with Hyper-V.Thats why lot of students chose to develop for android, because of no special requirement."

__label__1 Hey I thought it would be really useful if users could add a homepage to their Internet Explorer for their WP like they would on a desktop/PC

__label__1 -Should be able to put transparent (saved in PGN) lockscreens like WP7.5 Notification Center: -Should be able to control the screen when notification center is half open.
__label__0 There are heaps and HEAPS of really good developers outside of US who really want to contribute to making Windows Phone a preferred choice, so please Microsoft; make it simplier and make it DIGITAL!
__label__0 Currently in Mango these is a soft search button in the GUI displayed for context sensitive search.
__label__0 I thought I had raised this as a platform request, but seems it's showing up in Feature Feedback instead.
__label__0 I tried everything, then used system restore to restore to the previous restore point, that_Ü_ more
__label__0 Then we can use the Smartphone as remote control four our devices.
__label__0 VS2013 could create those folders in each project and bring in the classes (pages and user controls) from the original project.
__label__1 When you select a preferred RL service, it should also be available when you long-press a link so that you can send that link directly to your favorite service, rather than having to open the link, wait for it to load, then send it to Instapaper or Pocket or whatever you prefer."
__label__0 Is that in the upcoming roadmap?
__label__0 When used in combination with MVVM and sorted data, this will result in the fact that the LLS is positioned at the bottom of the list when all data is available.
__label__0 This is way more Adobe's UI problem than yours."
__label__1 Controls displaying the SIP when focused should provide a method to close the SIP to ensure data binding is applied.

__label__0 Seems there is an issue with the sd card in WP 8.1 Preview.

__label__0 I think many apps that need to generate a tile dynamically will encounter this issue.
__label__0 What do you think?

__label__0 Take a look here https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp We need a better and lighter way to install only what's needed for the C/C++ compiler.

__label__1 when a term is added, should lookup for feeds in popular RSS Feed Directories in one go.

__label__1 If I could add individual users as a feed, then I could see their updates without having to scroll through Facebook's ridiculous "wall".

__label__0 If the user uninstalls during a trial, it tracks this fact and prevents them from starting a new trial later.
__label__0 Home automation is a huge market for Windows devices.A big piece of this is being able to monitor/control IP Cameras such as the Foscam HD cameras.Being able to discover, enumerate, and stream video from and audio to/from these devices as part of the UAP platform (instead of wonky solutions like ONVIF) would be awesome"""
__label__0 windows phone dev is powerless without low level api to access drivers or add features to phone

__label__0 Other platforms (iOS and Android do support this!!!!!).
__label__0 I cannot get directions for Transit and Walk but for drive in the Maps for WP 8.1.
__label__1 Adding this feature will help alot.

__label__0 Lifehacker is a good example.

__label__0 As above
__label__0 What's going on here ?
__label__0 Even if fallbacks had to be kept around to support other platforms that didn't allow unsafe code, enabling unsafe code on the phone would allow it to use the same efficient implementations as the PC.
__label__0 When i call those codes, i get answer after 2 minutes and i don't have an option to reply with my choise.

__label__1 For example, if I have an app that can process images, I want other apps to be able to dicover my app and submit photos for me to process.
__label__1 I think this is a bug, because I think if the WriteableBitmap decides to update the PixelWidth and PixelHeight property, it should also update the PixelBuffer, or the data is inconsistent.
__label__0 The problem may be relevant to HTC HD7 only though, since I have no other device to test.
__label__1 Feel free to add the ability for extra apps as that's a requested feature and please keep adding performance improvements to make things run lighter.

__label__0 _ more"
__label__1 Windows phone store should show total number of app downloads (All Markets) as well as ratings and reviews of All Markets instead of showing rates and reviews based on region because it doesn't give a broad view and if by chance in any country there are no reviews on your app and someone want to download your app he might not just because he can't find it first of all (Cuz no rating) second he/she will think app doesn't have any reviews so it is not so good.

__label__0 It would be nice to be allowed to get basic information about these accounts.
__label__0 Imagine if you are calling someone who is already involved in a call, the waiting notification displayed which has been available for long time in several mobiles could give you a relief to contact him later instead of doing a recurring calling and bothering him/her.
__label__0 For example a control that can allow developers to seek feedback from user directly
__label__1 Better support for Commands for all controls, allowing to bind a Command in the ViewModel to any event from a supported control in XAML, without having to use third party tools such as MVVM Light.
__label__0 Then user can choose his own to be saved and use."
__label__1 Please provide full access to the ContactStore, eg, updating, deleting etc.
__label__1 I saw a TV Preview for a Show next week and I want to be reminded regarding this feed entry.

__label__0 If I download that track and play it in standard player there is no such a glitch.
__label__0 It is ok that some things will be awailable on Windows 8/9 devices which are not available on Windows Phone 8 / 9 and vice versa.

__label__1 My desire is to be able to catch up on podcasts either on my phone or on my desktop such that if I've listened to a podcast completely from either source (i.e. from my browser at home or work or on my cell phone) that the episode would be marked ""listened to"" (or read) and disappear from the list in Feedly on any of my machines as well as drop off of my BeyondPod list.
__label__0 However this is for battery and powered scenarios, and you don't want to be manually switching it back and forth all the time.
__label__0 Sample from my old Bing map application <my:MapLayer Name="AIS_A_Layer" Visibility="Visible" Opacity="0.5"> <my:MapItemsControl Name="A_Tracks" ItemsSource="{Binding AIS_A}" > <my:MapItemsControl.ItemTemplate> <DataTemplate> <my:MapPolyline Stroke="Black" StrokeThickness="1" Locations="{Binding AIS_Track}" Visibility="Visible"> </my:MapPolyline> </DataTemplate> </my:MapItemsControl.ItemTemplate> </my:MapItemsControl> <my:MapItemsControl Name="A_Symbols" ItemsSource="{Binding AIS_A}" > <my:MapItemsControl.ItemTemplate > <DataTemplate> <Canvas my:MapLayer.Position="{Binding Ship.Position}" Tag="{Binding Ship.MMSI}" Tap="Canvas_Tap_A"> <Polygon my:MapLayer.Position="{Binding Ship.Position}" Stroke="Black" Fill="Orange" StrokeThickness="1" Points="0, 0 10, 20 -10, 20 0, 0" Visibility="Visible"> <Polygon.RenderTransform> <RotateTransform Angle="{Binding Ship.COG}" CenterX="0" CenterY="0"></RotateTransform> </Polygon.RenderTransform> </Polygon> <TextBlock Text="{Binding Ship.Name}" Visibility="{Binding ElementName=Map_View,Path=Ship_Name_Visible}"> </TextBlock> </Canvas> </DataTemplate> </my:MapItemsControl.ItemTemplate> </my:MapItemsControl> </my:MapLayer> Today I can't instantiate a Mappolygon in an ItemControl from XAML.
__label__0 It will help to reduce misunderstandings.

__label__0 Limiting the development environment to Windows 8 only limits my ability to develop for Windows Phone, and ultimately will pull down Microsoft.

__label__0 The application would receive the decoded information and also, information about the barcode as the___ more

__label__0 You want people to develop UWP but you gives half-crapped systems."
__label__0 Instead we could get everything ready locally and do a push and upload it all quickly.
__label__0 Thanks!"
__label__0 I would gladly become a Feedly Pro subscriber if you offered something comparable.

__label__1 And can you please make the formatting support direct linking from the URLs embedded in the tweets.
__label__0 It allows third-party apps to integrate into the People Hub's 'What's New' feed, etc.
__label__0 To verify, try clicking on any method in Java Javadoc, for example open http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/ and click through -> java.applet -> AppletContext -> getApplet.
__label__1 have the possibility to use category of outlook, on wp7 for contact/email/calendar.
__label__0 Just as simple as it sounds, gifting an app to someone else with a Windows device.
__label__1 I suggest to create another option that alternates "lost of signal" and "bad signal".Create an infinite loop that breakes the connection in a random time.From 1 to 10 sec, for example."
__label__0 Video size is ~1GB so it must take long time to get 1.0 value.
__label__1 It would be much preferable to remove it from the Certificatio nprocess.
__label__1 Let us configure the directory and file names when saving to Dropbox, with tokens like <year>, <month>, <date>, <feed-name>, <post-date> etc.
__label__0 Many times apps/games were made free for limited time as offers promotions .
__label__0 Apps can't show the traveled route at_æ_ more
__label__1 I didn't see anyone else suggest this but I would think it would be very simple for Flip Board to add support for your service.
__label__0 I could only control the device with a keyboard plugged in to the USB port.
__label__0 is it possible to get a flash player for wp8 or Silverlight for wp8 more and more websites doesn't work by video clips
__label__0 There are situations in which it's necessary to securely store sensitive credentials but having them roam across devices is undesirable.On iOS, this can be done by creating a keychain item with the attribute kSecAttrAccessibleWhenPasscodeSetThisDeviceOnly."
__label__0 I liked Android and now bought HTC 8s with a 32 GB microSD to find out, that App to SD is not supported.
__label__0 You can now only see the console (but you need to manually put things in console as it doesn't show errors), not even the DOM.
__label__1 This would also be very nice so that you could add a 'create playlist' feature into the music+video hub.
__label__0 if they run as background tasks with live tiles, as most carriers provide limited amount of connection
__label__1 Please make sure that any data accessible from the Contact Details page is made available to the Contact class.

__label__0 Both Apple and Google allows us to create user accounts with release manager role, who has no access to sales/revenue reports."
__label__0 tl;dr: Creating a popular app is a bit of a chicken and egg problem.
__label__0 Which seems like something that Feedly might have been able to guess to begin with.
__label__0 Thanks!"
__label__1 You should be able to select a default application for certain functions.
__label__0 Allows C++ developers to produce components with a well-known ABI avoid the messing to recompile tons of sources every time

__label__0 I Need this to give the user a Signal he should/can react on

__label__0 Built-in browser of Feedly brakes such behavior"
__label__0 I am not sure if this is due to feedly app limitation or something else.
__label__0 For all countries prices are automatically set.
__label__0 Then my Windows works fine.
__label__0 nan
__label__1 Please provide an API that provides access to the texts to allow developers to implement an application to enable scenarios such as reading or archiving SMS messages.
__label__0 Change country on dev center account.
__label__0 So here is my scenario and you can clearly see why this API change would help to improve the code flow: var clientCert; ensureCertficatesAsync = function() { logger.trace("Checking client certificate"); if (clientCert) { logger.info("Using already loaded client certificate"); return WinJS.Promise.as(clientCert); } var certQuery = new Certificates.CertificateQuery(); certQuery.friendlyName = "Client Cert"; return Certificates.CertificateStores.findAllAsync(certQuery).then(function(certs) { if (!certs.length) { return___ more
__label__0 simple.
__label__0 At the moment, there is 1-to-1 relation between companies and countries.
__label__0 Feedly looks nice but NewsRob provides a significantly more useful experience for users with lots of feeds.; https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.newsrob.pro;

__label__0 In comparison with iOS the documentation for developing UWP apps is woefully inadequate.

__label__0 When I removed the "ru" language code and published my new version, the old version still remains with "Replaced and unpublished".
__label__0 So I think you shouldâè_âè__ more"
__label__0 Native video player and support for subtitle If I am right the native video player doesnt support subtitle file (.srt).
__label__0 You have to take screenshots in one language, change it to another, wait until emulator reloads and so on.___ more
__label__1 Can Microsoft Corporation make a similar app, please?
__label__1 I would be convinient if the copyAndReplaceAsync method would return something similar to the copyAsync method.
__label__0 I can log in to Feedly, that works fine.
__label__0 More convenient than using multitask function."
__label__0 Feedly to Google plus causes the Feedly app to crash back to the home screen on Kindle Fire.
__label__0 ...instead of low/mid/high
__label__0 It might happen that app can have so many reviews on otherâè_âè__ more"
__label__0 Because WVGA and WXGA are the same aspect ratio, and because the website is a giant PITA in uploading images, you have to take and submit 3 screenshots per actual screenshot per language.
__label__0 Now in SDK 7.1 it is possible to record audio by using the AudioSink Silverligh class, so we don't need to trick the system by using the XNA loop, but when using this class the tag <Capability Name="ID_CAP_CAMERA"/> should be present at WMAppManifest.xml file, but we are only using microphone.
__label__0 it so happens that when you type or are playing a game, a slight touch either on the back or search button takes you out of context.
__label__0 A an ability to the emulator that can emulate a bad data connection so we can discover performance problems before our clients receive it.
__label__0 Web sites like Tweetdeck, Pandora, Facebook, Bing, etc. all include this functionality.
__label__0 Potential scenarios: - Developer doesn't have SLAT on their machine and wants to run the VM on a SLAT capable machine/server - Developer is running their dev environment in a virtual environment (e.g., local Hyper-V, remote Hyper-V, Parallels) and wants to run the emulator in another child VM on the same physical host they are running on (since she can't run a VM inside of a VM) - The ability to run a dev environment fully remote A developer should be able to run an emulator instance outside of the developer's environment, and be able to connect/deploy/debug into that remote VM.
__label__0 we are publishing the same apps in Windows Phone Store and Windows App Store.
__label__1 As an alternative to that, you could also create a 1x1 widget mimicking the app icon with unread counter.
__label__0 see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33615542/error-not-enough-storage-using-fileloggingsession Writing to a FileLoggingSession that has a LgoFileGenerated event atttached via a LoggingChannel in a loop without pausing throw exception "Not enough storage".
__label__0 i.e feedly handles payment and delivery of information, creator creates information and receives revenue.
__label__0 When an error occurs it happens a lot that exception.StackTrace is null (in the App UnhandledException handler for instance).
__label__1 And Twitter tweets from your followers can be another feed."
__label__1 Allow the use of desktop keyboard to interact with WP8 emulator similar to the current mouse functionality.
__label__1 Hi is it possible to add "proceeds since last payment" information in the windows phone dev center applications
__label__0 the current search in Office only works on titles of OneNote docs, but not their content.. which is not very useful!
__label__0 S/MIME email is a mandatory requirement at my company and support for that on the Windows Phone platform is needed before we can consider it.
__label__0 My app takes approx two seconds to run, even though it only loads a single image and shows no splash screen... You should work on that - I have run out of options to make it faster.
__label__0 shoudn't be tough to implement but would be an beneficial for an user.
__label__0 Even with native code support on WP8 it is very time consuming to port existing libraries to do this.
__label__1 I currently use NewsBlur, but I'd love to transfer all my feeds via OPML to Feedly.
__label__1 Windows Runtime should allow public non-sealed classes.This is already implemented for XAML classes, now this should be available for all Windows Runtime components.
__label__1 Please make it a standard mode of usage for each task.
__label__1 It will be great if you will develop a Windows software, for those who would like to read their feed on the computer.	
__label__0 But clicking on tile still work's - calendar opens.
__label__1 To Feedly, can you please provide this type of service - perhaps within you Pro account if there are extra overheads.
__label__0 A shared key chain to share data between the apps, this help in apps with features like SSO
__label__0 I created a few ideas in the get satisfaction community (don't remember how I got there) and was very surprised never to get an answer... until I realized you guys worked in user voice...
__label__0 Control to send desired picture to native pinch to zoom controller.
__label__1 We should have an option in the API to know whether to search for the app in store or just return error if not installed.
__label__1 What I want is to be able to skim through my feed items and quickly open N tabs in the background, then go to my browser and read through them at my leisure.
__label__0 Option to browse In private.
__label__0 My Lumia 920 micro-usb port just broke so I need to deploy via wifi or bluethoot.
__label__0 You can retweet and answer Tweets but You cant favorite
__label__0 If it were possible to tell the task to show a pin (or pins) at a specific point (or points) that that would allow for a better user experience.
__label__0 Si WP tuviera una oferta de aplicaciones de mensajerê_a y herramientas tan amplia como los demêçs SO seguramente seria una buena competencia.
__label__0 It allows the developers of that control library to greatly simplify the xaml by reducing the number of XMLNS declarations they need.
__label__1 i really liked the wp7 and would love to see similar fuctionality availlable in wp7 too.
__label__0 When techbargain.com updated their site, it no longer worked with feedly.
__label__0 Having a lot of i-gear, iPhone, iPads etc that can print, it is dissappointing not beeing able to use the equipment I already own.
__label__0 The calendar tile on wp8.1 (up to date) frozes / hangs.
__label__1 It is my belief that the search algorithm could be improved to cater for use case two without adversely effecting use case one.
__label__0 If you have many apps like me (about 40) it takes a lot of time.
__label__0 A certain rival brand of phones allows users to switch between their LIVE equivalent accounts with no problems whatsoever.
__label__0 The symptoms are as stated in the title.
__label__0 960x1280 Now check the properties of wbmp: PixelWidth: 960 PixelHeight: 1280 PixelBuffer.Length: 1228800 The length of PixelBuffer is totally wrong, the buffer size shoud be 960 x 1280 x 4 = 4915200 The wrong value 1228800 comes from the original size: 480 x 640 x 4.
__label__0 Support for this would destroy any argument for an apple device because they aren't going to do this any time soon and it would close the gap in functionality between WP and android.
__label__0 We also have no entries listed for Windows 10 emulators (running or not) in the 'devices' output.
__label__1 It would be also cool to allow for more than one application bar per page, so you could specify one at the top, left, bottom or right.
__label__1 Many thanks Sameh Hi, As we know, there is a lot of limitations is WP8 OS due the high security in the OS itself which is very good, but some time we need to allow some apps to do extra works, apps which we trust i.e: hotmail app, facebook app, skype app ....
__label__0 Indeed, we're discouraged and not happy...
__label__0 Adding visbility to the battery mAh would then allow battery "health" apps, charger comparisons, and inductive charger efficiency (or inneficiency).
__label__0 I didn't put the tab there, and I DON'T WANT IT.
__label__0 I have apps I would like to transfer (which had IAPs) but I cannot do___ more
__label__0 I later found that the original submission had also been successful, even though it had hung, so that there were now two duplicate submissions in "Processing Certification" with slightly different aliases.
__label__0 Currently windows phone is very restricted for developers.
__label__0 It would be much less frustrating for Windows/Windows Phone developers to have hints sent with the certification failed reports, which make it easier to tackle obvious issues that arise because of the restrictions of Windows/ Windows Phone.

__label__0 Secondly, we have many versionsâè_âè__ more"
__label__0 LOL, everything was lost.
__label__1 Also, I want to be able to set the % left of power for when the batterysaver kicks in.
__label__0 Even as a developer we can create most of the apps for individual users that is standalone.
__label__0 I can not develop, because I can not transfer more than three applications for AppHub.
__label__0 Enterprise which will be the one that we have today and a basic version will be more flexible, more open for users and developers
__label__0 Making it possible to change iso in Video mode.
__label__0 The same applies when you list all apps from the publisher/developer.
__label__1 It would be good to backup linked contacts.
__label__0 A good is example of this is theâè_âè__ more"
__label__0 For instance the following dev accounts have the same apps spammed under multiple accounts: Maajio Dev Box Team Dopeware Labs Yemba Dev Wamba Dev All of the above accounts are the same developer.
__label__0 There all still to much bugs on current main apps.
__label__0 This is also completely secure because the runtime can analyze the class (and it's IL) being submitted.
__label__0 nan
__label__0 The current design of the CameraCaptureUI on Windows 10 desktop/tablet renders it useless.
__label__0 These devices have a simple network interface an cannot be extended for several reasons (flash size, communication library).
__label__1 After that, it would be great to have the option to select an image from IsolatedStorage so that my app can update its splash screen image as needed.
__label__0 Partiendo de nada conectar con el todo!!
__label__0 As a recent purchaser of a Windows Phone: I love the platform, and it has huge potential to grow in competition with Android and Apple.

__label__0 Hello, I am an italian developer, sorry if my english is not good.I have a problem with a windows phone app, and I have wrote to the support."
__label__0 As an Example for the Trusted App Center Settings: * MyOwnEmailClient APP Permission Requested: * Send Email (Without user intervention) * Send SMS (without user intervention) * Manage Contacts (read/write) * ... and so on.
__label__1 Would love to have a direct link to do this.
__label__0 I think this is not correct, because using Paypal I can receive money in another country but I don't want pay extra costs for Paypal and also i can insert my tax plan in a country different of my country in my account.
__label__0 I hope it will be!
__label__0 The majority of apps I see at the marketplace doesn't have any review's.
__label__1 Allow the messaging application to join in the default messaging application (Hub Message) for full interaction.
__label__1 An easy-to-use donate-function might turn feedly pro into a universal news portal for fact-based quality news.
__label__0 In Silverlight, it's maintained merely with different Urls.
__label__0 I have Googled and found at the moment, Feedly only works on one web browser which is Google Chrome.
__label__0 I have a chrome icon in the action bar.	
__label__0 This is useful to me as I'd prefer that a group or groups of feeds in some folders appear at the bottom of the ""all items view"".
__label__1 Login should go through the Google account stored on the Android device.
__label__0 http://www.pitorque.de/MisterGoodcat/post/Somethings-Missing-from-the-WebBrowser-Control.aspx
__label__0 Currently in D2D for Windows Phone ID2D1Factory::CreateWicBitmapRenderTarget is strangely not supported.
__label__0 But if we try to save an Image within app inside Media library or some Isolated storage we can't prserve exif info of that image.
__label__0 I use this property to restore application state after tombstoning, but the user experience is terrible because this just causes the pano items to reorder themselves.
__label__0 I'm not sure if this can be abused as we've seen on Mango where the phone is non responsive upon receiving a specially crafted text via notification.
__label__0 The Windows Dev Center does not allow that.
__label__0 Marketplace policy requires music apps to populate both properties, so Zune should do this, too.
__label__0 Apps Quest submission doesn't work.
__label__0 User can also choose to run ""everyday, every week, etc"".
__label__0 Currently apps are executed in sandboxes and there's no way to apps can work together.
__label__0 If developers need to create a request with multiple instances of MIME content (e.g. an email and an attachment), they need a capability to add the Content-Transfer-Encoding and Content-ID headers to each of the mime contents.
__label__0 Your account is validating by Symantec.You cannot submit any app during this period.It will takes 7 to 10 days typically.Open your account settings and make sure registered information is correct.When you modify account information, vetting will be triggered automatically."
__label__0 I see that your apps can still be accessed through deep link and current users of the app will still be able to receive updates.
__label__1 A sample project for using Hawaii OCR API would be very helpful for the developers.Also need help with how to use image pre-processing techniques and supported image processing libraries on WP8 to improve OCR accuracy.
__label__0 possibility to watch videos with .srt or others directly on wp7
__label__0 Everyone in the USA has nice upload speeds possibly, but not worldwide, and I presume Microsoft would wish to enable developers from other countries also to be able to use their dev center.
__label__0 great app!
__label__0 I believe that other kinds of automatic measures could be taken, but I only remember these 4 because I ported a very simple app.
__label__1 Add support for Office to directly send presentation to wireless projector.
__label__1 Allow users to organize tiles into separate hubs.
__label__1 Add Image Cropping support on the CameraCaptureUI on mobile devices as it is on the desktop
__label__0 If you are browsing web in your app and you reach a site protected by basic auth the control stops working.
__label__0 [WP Silverlight 8.1 app] It was installed on the Phone, but you can NOT move it to SD though Storage Sense.
__label__0 Internet explorer keeps running in background and is always visible while back button is kept pressed.
__label__1 Please enable removing language code from the Dev Center "language history" For example if you ever selected "ru" and "ru-ru" laguages and you published this xap to the Store then it causes Tile localization to show the en-us(default) tile localization which is bad.
__label__0 When we are on call and @the same time I want to look up for a number from phone book, I can't do it right now.
__label__0 There are times when this is greatly needed!
__label__0 And make the start screen interactions smoother?
__label__0 OpenXML SDK Office for WinRT ê_ Office Primary Interop Assembly Classes for WinRT Win8 applications need to be more productive for businesses!
__label__1 Microsoft should do approach with developer aplication service and makers of office space in order to them to make the aplication run on Windows Phone 7, 7.5, 7.8, 8, 8.1 for all brand (Nokia, HTC, Samsung etc)
__label__0 best regards and a_Ü_ more
__label__1 Provide an API to use Cortana services within apps as well as provide implementable Interface(s) which expose App-Services to Cortana, then Cortana can call these methods and developers worldwide can extends it's functionality.
__label__0 I ask via chat they give me illogical answer like your app its not on market and its not searchable but only deeplink work !
__label__1 For example, allowing the user to view the time_æ_ more
__label__0 It's not healthy to keep several accounts that means nothing, specially ones that you just had to create because_Ü_ more
__label__1 It would be cool to allow the ApplicationBar to have more icons available.
__label__0 Android has third-party apps that can block your apps/games with a password.
__label__0 So when i click the search button i open the internet explorer.
__label__1 For the most time the watch is disconnected from the phone, but from time to time it could connect to a service running on the phone (maybe timed, maybe because user presses a button on the phone) to send a request, which the service on the phone then handles (some additional data transfer between the phone and watch and the phone and some cloud service may be involved) The actual trigger from device to phone could be done with Bluetooth LE if listening for incomming SPP connections is too much of a drain as long as it would be possible for an application to do some background processing and data transfer based on triggers comming from external hardware accessories.
__label__0 However, Internet Explorer doesn't let us upload anything!
__label__0 This is unfair to devs and cheapens the Windows Store experience.
__label__1 Add a tile view like in old Windows 8.1 Store.
__label__0 This makes for quick access to the site.
__label__0 However there is still a 5mm gap at the top of the page (not including the space for the time etc) that is wasteful.
__label__1 There seems to be a long-standing serious issue with the Store (or possibly the dev portal) which needs to be addressed urgently.
__label__0 Surely the design ideology was that the hardware search button was context sensitive.
__label__1 Allow screen capture to be taken from background task OR through mdm protocol.
__label__0 For example with regards to controls there is no real explanation of their behaviour.
__label__0 The current developer ecosystem for WindowsPhone apps is focused on individual developers or corporate developer accounts that typically distribute apps to the masses via the Marketplace.
__label__0 Feedly is a website.
__label__0 With the app on SD the device can be better ;)
__label__0 Details: - Handset: Nokia Lumia 1520 - Operator: 3UK - Unstable/zero ceullar data after updating to WP 8.10.12382.878 [Earlier - WP 8.1 update was fine - Data is working fine on wi-fi - Problem occurs when switching to cellular data - Cellular data works for a few minutes, then goes off - IE reports 'Error: cannot find server or DNS error' - Apps just don't work: Facebook reports problem getting data - Cellular data -the icons keep flickering between H and H+ and from 3G to 4G - Toggling airline mode on/off restores data for a few minutes - then -shuts-off - Checked APN settings are correct - even manually added an identical -APN profile, but this seems to have the same effect as toggling airline mode - Selecting 3G as max connection speed seems to help - albeit only very, very marginally - Strangely, even after the data connection is stopped, it will still allow me to access my MNO's home page (Three.co.uk) - as if the network is detecting tethering - Called MNO, but they confirmed there is NO block on my account - Hard reset made no difference, including factory reset - Soft reset made no difference - Not using VPN on the phone - SIM is official NanoSIM from Three UK.
__label__0 This is used in most of the menus and in the SMS and calender view.
__label__1 Right now Feedly isn't consistantly running across browser, this needs to be investigated and fixed.

__label__0 ReportInterval set to 1 second, the phone would regularly take 30 - 45 seconds and sometimes minutes to report.
__label__1 Perhaps that could be available as Toolkit in codeplex.com.
__label__0 Being unable to set up our own set of contacts to test with is incredibly frustrating, especially as the test set doesn't even cover all scenarios (none have photos, for example).

__label__0 Hello Feedly developers, here is a proposal on how to create a win win situation for readers and content creators.	
__label__1 My suggestion is to add an option to pin the application in use, for future use, when an application is open.
__label__0 It is unacceptable simply because according to RFC 2616 Section 4.1 (Header Field Definitions), the message headers of an HTTP 1.1 message value is optional.
__label__0 we think, that an certificate manager would resolve the problem.

__label__1 OK, I realize that this is dependent on the carrier, but WP7 needs to support it if the carrier can offer it.
__label__0 There's a history of apps affected by this issue and possibly more apps to be affected in the future if the issue goes unfixed.
__label__0 Microsoft has to understand that refusing adequate support to developers will strike back as thousands of customers, who are using that same publisher's applications will be left without further updates and improvements.
__label__0 For example, my app is currently fairly well reviewed (4.5 stars).
__label__0 Its funny how Zune has the ability to sort Pictures by name but when they get synced to a Windows 7 Phone it loses that ability.
__label__0 My game icon was designed to have a transparent background, but when I published it and saw it listed in the Game Hub, the transparent background was not filled with the user's theme color as it would have been in the app list or when pinned to the home screen.

__label__0 New+Rising category in Windows Phone store is not updating.
__label__0 Hi Few day ago I have started using you excelent app, but one thing annoying me.	
__label__0 If so, what happens to existing Windows Phone 7 apps that run on a Windows Phone 8 device?
__label__0 When I send content from Feedly web to Evernote, the formatting comes across wonky and unclear.
__label__0 But all will not do it.

__label__0 is it possible to create a traffic counter that can show, how many traffic I have by wifi or by gms (lte).
__label__1 The only way around this is for the control vendor to throw every single class that might be used in XAML (not just controls but other types too), in the same namespace, creating a very ugly unwieldy API to code against.
__label__0 Photos, email, internet, games, and stability in their learning curve.
__label__1 When playing a video using XAML MediaElement the cursor should hide automatically after some seconds.
__label__1 Would also be helpful in it's own right for general localization testing to verify that localized strings have messed up layout.
__label__0 I uninstalled all plugins and I only reactivated the feedly plugin to be sure
__label__0 ShowAt show the flyout with the size (width) defined in the style However ShowAtAsync show the flyout with the with of the element passed in parameter and ignore the style.I think its a bug.ShowAtAsync would be more convinient to use but we cannot as the flyout is not size according to its content, but to the width of the attached button."""
__label__0 Lastly, app submission testing would ensure that the app "plays nicely" in what it offers.
__label__0 However, when trying this (ran it on WP 8.1 and WP 10) the user is allowed to leave the password field empty and click on ""Save"", which then returns them to the app's code to handle the token returned.
__label__0 Currently, we have to test if the returned points is inside the rect with a size of map.ActualWidth and map.ActualHeight.

__label__1 It would be very helpful the same functionality also in the Windows Phone emulator.
__label__0 This bug is easy to reproduce: var wbmp = new WriteableBitmap(480,640); await wbmp.SetSourceAsync(stream); //the stream comes from a picture with larger size, i.e.
__label__0 Right now, if I have two Google accounts (and separate Chrome sessions) - one for work and one for personal use, I cant use feedly across sessions
__label__0 The current AdControl crashes any app which uses the silverlight/XNA hybrid mode.No debug data..no stack trace..
__label__1 I'd like to feed crash reports straight into my bug tracker.
__label__0 I do not need all the Pro features.
__label__0 Does this have anything to do with wifi being one of location sources?
__label__1 Developers must be given additional enumeration values in Socketype and ProtocolType to create variety of sockets like raw sockets based on ICMP, IGMP... etc.
__label__1 Even there should be a option to delete the MPNS certificate .
__label__0 Hopefully with fluently switch and creative gesture and UI.
__label__0 all this is because of a simple reason 'Security' which is important in corporate companies but casual users are more out there.

__label__0 When uploading screenshots, we are given the choice to upload one of the these sizes: 768 x 1280, 720 x 1280, or 480 x 800 pixels I would like to recommend adding the ability to upload screenshots in 1080x1920 pixel size.

__label__0 So Microphone.SampleRate property just returns this fixed value.
__label__1 It would be nice to have an indicator on the Chrome extension icon to remind me if I have saved items to review.
__label__0 There are several developers using dishonest methods to boost their apps, including fake ratings.Those apps are as good as useless to consumers (cheap website wrappers etc.) and still have dozens of maximum ratings shortly after being released.Those apps get ranked high in the listings and take away the place of the few others that actually are good.Reporting usually takes several days or more than one week until something actually happens.Also, I've heard that MS just warns those devs, but even lets them keep obvious fake max ratings."

__label__0 We can't create good apps for this services without this API, looks on your Skype client, wtf??
__label__1 We need different sound levels...sound level for system, for alarm clock, for music-radio, and different for keyboard.
__label__0 We were also able to switch between text messages and Facebook messages on the fly.
__label__0 tl;dr: Creating a popular app is a bit of a chicken and egg problem.
__label__0 I noticed some programs are using the hardware device id for giving comfort to the user - even after reset.
__label__0 Though this idea has been expressed to varying degrees with regard to specific services, like google translate, I've not seen it expressed generally."
__label__0 But of course they exist in the store.___ more
__label__0 In this way, the current intransparent ""recommendation count"" would become more transparent.
__label__0 Also, having a ShowContactTask would allow me to give my user a quick shortcut to post a message on Twitter or Facebook without having to implement those SDKs (especially since the APIs do not currently give you access to social networking contacts to be able to pull their social network handles).
__label__0 And according to web searches about this problem I felt that I'm not a lone with this.
__label__0 <video src="http://mlmidev.webcastcenter.com/mlm/idev.isml/manifest(format=m3u8-aapl).m3u8"></video> It works on iOS, Android 3+, and Apple computers with Safari.
__label__0 These feedbacks were all refused, and I can imagine the motivation behind this, so I try to formulate better what's really the point is on this: If a developer has many unpublished apps or IAPs their dashboard start to become a mess and the developer have to see to a lot of not (more) relevant data regarding to app that there aren't no longer maintained or simply products which the developer is not focused right now.
__label__1 Please get back the old OneDrive integration to windows phone 8.1.
__label__1 Developers should be focusing more on App as opposed to implement the standard navigation pattern and spend effort on styling."

__label__0 The problem starts after a certain app update.
__label__0 Currently, Microsoft.Phone.Info.DeviceStatus is available to know the device manufacturer and it is only accesible from C# project making it a round way about to include this project in C++ ( managed code).
__label__0 I hope you will think about it and take a decision in my favor.
__label__0 That involves a lot of time, which is a large risk to smaller development companies.
__label__0 I started the windows phone 8.1 emulator with the following configuration for testing purpose: UI Language: German, Region: US, Format Settings: Irish.
__label__1 It would be nice to be able to load XAML from string without freezing UI - it could easily take over 200ms to load a short bit of XAML.
__label__0 Also some way to change (enhance) audio/video captured from mic/camera before it will be encoded and saved into file.
__label__1 Can we have an API to enroll the device through an app, or allow mdm enrollment to initiate through a browser download.
__label__0 Expected behavior when I follow one of the links, find it interesting and click the Pocket icon, is to save the clicked-through article.
__label__0 A developer should be able to grant access to another app for data access.
__label__0 Perhaps at least press+hold on backspace to bring up an arrows menu.
__label__0 Which I am able to do on iOS, Android and J2ME platforms.
__label__0 I see no reason why they wouldn't because I know they transferred over a bunch of Google Reader feeds but they aren't doing what feedly is.

__label__0 In the new store is not possible to delete an existing app from the store(or if exist, it is really well hidden).

__label__0 By far.
__label__1 I know it already does that for Android app, well, because Android OS lists all the apps that keep sharing capability when I hit 'Share' icon in the feedly app but it would be awesome to have it in the web app."

__label__1 In other words, I want to be able to create designs such as this: http://i.imgur.com/27fUxtM.jpg Providing more design options, allows us to diversify our application's interface designs and set it apart from others in the market."
__label__1 Start by expanding the number of apps that can use a certain key word, such as "childrens stories" so that new apps who innovate can displace those who got their first with potentially crappy apps.
__label__0 For the 2nd time, I used another OS to go to my Win 10 desktop to delete the file.
__label__0 I have stated the folder names I use (Pages and UserControls) but the rule could deal with other names as well.
__label__0 when I click the icon it just says no unread articles where it used to show lots of articles I could open in new tabs.
__label__0 The point is to make the app universal across devices so that our engineers do not have to spend too much time learning and relearning the controls.
__label__0 Whatsapp cant send audios, truecaller cant interpret incoming calls, we cant access the list of apps installed and numerous others too.
__label__0 When porting my Windows 8 app to Windows Phone 8, I feel that the Universal App template (which is already awesome) could do some other things to increase even more productivity: 1 - Create Pages and UserControl folders: Let's face it, unless we want to create sh**** apps, we won't have the same UI for all platforms, so we'll end up creating the same pages and controls in BOTH versions.
__label__0 These lists are are broken, so there is no actual way to find games you are looking for by category as most are only showing a handful of games per category."
__label__1 I would like to have the ability to delete all of Scheduled Toast Notifications with one built-in method which won't affect performance of my app.

__label__0 Adding the following four lines to a report, that probably has been sent out thousands of times, would have saved myself more than an hour of searching for an efficient solution and reading: ---------------------- This might help with Dark/Light theme problems: - - (Visibility)Application.Current.Resources["PhoneDarkThemeVisibility"]; or similar - (Brush)Application.Current.Resources["PhoneBackgroundBrush"]; ---------------------- and maybe additional links to documentation It would be much less frustrating for Windows/Windows Phone developers to have hints sent with the certification failed reports, which make it easier to tackle obvious issues that arise because of the restrictions of Windows/ Windows Phone.

__label__0 Adding new test users without new submission.
__label__0 At the moment, when launching the BingMapsTask it's only possible to set the center and zoom level.
__label__0 It's been seen over time how simple barriers can stop people from doing activities that they want to do and that benefit them and others.
__label__0 It will help to keep cleanness and order in the Dashboard if you allow developers to delete from the list apps or in-app products that will never be published again.
__label__1 A better manipulation of exif APIs will be very helpfull.
__label__0 This function used to return the correct debug screen on Windows Phone 7 emulator, but it returns a buffer full of 0xffffffff values when executing it under Windows Phone 8 emulator.

__label__1 Also need API for voice record with background agent.
__label__1 Can you please fully unlock windows phone 7.
__label__1 it will be great, if APP can access files in Documents dir.

__label__1 Make it possible to optionally declare a function OnClick() for live tiles, such that this code is executed when the live tiles is presed without leaving the home screen.
__label__0 This will benefit for applications which create audio, or recording voice, it will be easy and unified way to export audio files instead of create extra server program.
__label__1 I believe there needs to be a marking system in the OS like the option of marking several emails in the pop mails.

__label__0 PCM audio encoding is the only available one, it is needed to have some way to encode and compress audio to WMA, MP3 or any encoding to allow smaller transfers when we have to send the audio to a web service.
__label__1 I can understand that tapping on the reminder cannot take me to the app if the screen is locked, but at least, give me a possibility to unlock the screen.
__label__1 Allow background images under the tiles
__label__0 I have already selected the appropriate category for you leave this feedback.
__label__0 I use Google Auth for both Pocket and for Feedly.
__label__1 Bulk publishers should be made to consolidate their apps, and the rest should not pass.
__label__0 The issue they (and even I) have is trying to put it on the marketplace.
__label__0 Current mode is focused on Marketplace apps.
__label__0 I have released several versions of the app, yet I cannot find "the number of new users" or "the number of existing users who have upgraded to the new app version" in the DEV center.
__label__0 In the Dashboard, the submission is configured like this: Distribution = Your app can be found by customers browsing or searching the Store.
__label__0 I spend a few hours at least each time I update the app using online translators and copying and pasting between all of the fields and a online translator.
__label__1 Unfortunately, Feedly's OPML support is artificially limited to Google Reader's exact OPML format, but there's no reason we can't expand it to handle NewsBlur's OPML download format for importing into Feedly."
__label__0 And the focus s and flash you can change it.
__label__0 Currently for dynamic data binding controlls like listbox, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms668604%28v=vs.95%29.aspx">ObservableCollection</a> is recommended.
__label__0 They are fine with the SDK and practically making the application.
__label__1 Please add the support of Audio Effects (e.g. Equalizer etc.) to the BackgroundMediaPlayer API.
__label__0 All this while keeping the sandbox mentality that the OS has.
__label__0 Albeit, it takes 24 hrs; itself is very slow but sometimes it takes 3-5 days.
__label__0 The idea is that we can develop a regular app and we request our permissions in the manifest, OR the app can ASK FOR TRUST so if the user agrees the app will be shown in the trusted app center in the settings with its extra permissions requested.
__label__0 So like google, facebook, linkedin I want to create contacts, calendar and access to message hub (also writing messages with my account).
__label__0 currenty when you hit the Back button from the Folders (in the Mail app), it takes you back to Homescreen.
__label__0 Select "Delete".
__label__0 It's AFAIK impossible to create an app that opens as soon as it's tapped.

__label__0 I can login into my account for the past 3 days.	
__label__1 Please do not abandon market in China !"
__label__0 In our video conferencing app network access seems to get shut down for a couple of sec approx.
__label__0 Sometimes they're much more useful than data binding (for example, when I need a StaticResource as a property value).
__label__0 Currently this is not possible because the agents are disabled after 15 days if the application is not opened.
__label__1 -Should be able to control music ( Play, Pause, Next & Previous + song info ) directly from the notification center.
__label__0 Ideally, a mini storefront or splash page for the company and product would help draw in clients.
__label__0 If you are more requirements of your video, such as bit rate, encoder, etc, you are do these settings one by one in the pop-up Formats window.</p> <img src="http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7189/7028832023_19c51b3ae9.jpg"; /> <p>4.
__label__1 It would be an improvement if they displayed as graphic Smilies instead.
__label__0 The Problem: The apps are accessible with the Store link: e.g. https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9WZDNCRFJ323

__label__0 Big lack.
__label__0 I know you can set a preference to save an article to a read later service instead of saving it to Feedly, but I like Feedly's save feature within the apps.	
__label__0 You have to take screenshots in one language, change it to another, wait until emulator reloads and so on._æ_ more
__label__0 Allowing for tester groups or "profiles" would allow for efficient test setup in the Marketplace, especially for multiple products, by allowing a group to be assigned to the app as it is entered in the Marketplace as a beta.
__label__0 For example, if you want to retrieve gelolocations frequently in the background.
__label__0 Oddly with Windows 8.1 tooling installed and Windows 10 SDK, we can actually see the list of Windows 10 emulators listed in the AppDeployCmd output (and need to do some post-filtering to separate the 8.1 and 10 emulators).
__label__0 There is a Github repository but the samples have errors and it is difficult to modify them to suit yourâè_âè__ more"
__label__0 It is extremely poor ""invoice"", no company logo, no company name, no postal code, no company address, no phone number to contact, no tracking (transaction) number, no payment instrument info, no president name, product name doesn't display fully, my name / postal code / address / phone number doesn't display, does Microsoft hire elementaryâè_âè__ more"
__label__0 I installed these manually later.
__label__1 It was good if we could set the app or in-app product to be free for one day for example and return back after that.
__label__1 Once we change the name, then everything works all right.
__label__0 No need to feel up credit card details.
__label__0 You have to manually use the website to change descriptions, switch languages, lots of copy and paste, remove each screenshot, put a new screenshot.
__label__0 I was surprised to find that the, built-in, media player doesn't support the HTML5 video element and live streaming.
__label__1 Please expose the ID property for Contacts and Appointments.
__label__0 WCF discovery not supported in Windows Phone.
__label__0 Filtering out the Windows 10 by category shown almost no results.
__label__0 As developer, I don't understand why I need add to all my projects copy of (not very small) Windows Phone Toolkit for effects, which platform already has built-in :/ thank you.
__label__1 It will be helpful for many developers if a few sample new project templates which show when and where variables can be created, instantiated so that better app experiences can be given to users.
__label__0 Furthermore, without any scientific proofs, I assume most reminders will arrive when the screen is locked, so why have a feature that can only work for a fraction of the time?
__label__1 Scan it and Bing Vision give you a list of the nearest store that have them in stock.
__label__0 My problem is, I can use any calendar app, but the function goes back to the base calendar.
__label__1 Please add it ASAP
__label__0 The hardware button seems to always pull up a Bing!
__label__0 Other similar apps have this functionality, it would be quite useful to my workflow, at least.
__label__0 Today I can't instantiate a Mappolygon in an ItemControl from XAML.
__label__0 The old developer dashboard allowed me to remove apps that I no longer want to be published.
__label__1 Therefore, it would be great if devs could put apps in the marketplace offering two___ more
__label__0 (TimeTrigger won't serve this purpose, as 1) it at least requires 15 minutes slot 2) it has the trigger time betweenâè_âè__ more"
__label__0 Especially if there are deadlines to fulfill, it comes in very handy if there is a sort of progressbar indicating how many steps are necessary to get certified.
__label__0 A event that triggers after a call has ended with: Phone nr and Call Length, also giving an opportunity to display an app screen.
__label__0 In every communication emails the support officer's manager and generic escalation emails are included.
__label__0 But scrolling seems to take a little long..
__label__0 It's so boring that you need do that also for microsoft apps like photosynth and skype !!
__label__1 To go 1 step further, making the support email process anonymous would probably convince more people to use the support system.
__label__0 I would especially like the name and the photo
__label__1  Allow a new version of NewsRob to use the feedly backend API.
__label__0 - .
__label__0 The side area allows you to include your Facebook and Twitter feed.
__label__0 Over 85% of people find that these gradients improve readability, and the plugins work great on feedly.
__label__0 WP7 will only let me use exchange with registered and installed certificates and will not let me bypass if I know it is okay.
__label__1 Create Delicious integration to allow sharing to delicious.com
__label__0 Ex if you see a poster of a movie you want to see.
__label__0 For sharing audio and video there should be a very plain possibility to share stuff as already encoded package.
__label__0 while tried to integrate through wcf its not responding.
__label__0 I just wanted to say well done to Microsoft for offering a very good browsing experience on wp8.1 with ie11.With ie11 was able to watch e.g Putlocker videos with no interference such as ads popping up.On a friends Android doing the same thing it kept popping up saying """"your phone has a virus""""."
__label__0 The idea is to install partially or all the data of the application to cloud services and not to the local device.
__label__0 1.- Check if an ApplicationID is installed/purchased 2.- Share files between applications in something that could be called "SharedStorageFiles" instead of "IsolatedStorageFiles".
__label__0 Although it is possible to define custom ETW events, and to generate those events, the publicly available tooling does not currently provide a way to get access to these events.

__label__0 And I was surprised to read in the MSDN that it returns "nothing" as a result of its async call.
__label__0 I think there are two ways to improve the beta program: 1.
__label__0 x.x IP address of the emulator - but I can find no way to get that programmatically either.
__label__0 But when a developer submitted an app and it's failing for a reason/policies, it's worth sending a developer exactly what happened with his/her app.
__label__0 Unfortunately this is only a very small part of the NFC capabilities.
__label__0 "Save number / Contact" "SMS txt number rely" You only have delete and block.
__label__1 I need a way to remove files from my WP8 device which have been "disliked".
__label__0 In the beginning of WP7 users had to register a new live-account and set the location to US to get access to the marketplace for example.
__label__1 Have an option to make items open directly in the Chrome Browser on mobile
__label__0 It would be easier to sync calendars if they have a RemoteId like appointments.
__label__0 I had to re-open video and change the Position property again and sometimes this problem is disappeared.
__label__1 Be responsible and give more & specific details, why an app failed rather than pointing a policies which talks about several things.
__label__0 It is possible to workaround this with MapPolyline.
__label__0 I currently use gRead widget to see my unread count on Google Reader.
__label__1 I have quite a few notebooks and would like to be able to select one notebook as a default so I can simply click the Evernote icon and voila, the article saved to my default notebook."
__label__0 In fact, how does one do it?
__label__0 I just my dev center account just like facebook and watch for notifications.
__label__0 But not the Mappolygon which is sad as I want to draw tracks and other information that is based on lat/long coordinates and want them to be drawn on the map as they used to in bing maps.
__label__0 I know I can code one, but it should be one of the standard controls.
__label__0 .
__label__1 I just want to tell you that it will be good if you give option to lock the applications specifically,like sms,..
__label__0 My boss is not a developer and has no development tools but absolutely needs to see the progress of development in a timely manner.
__label__0 The MediaPlayer class can play Song objects, but there is currently no way to get at the song data.
__label__1 We should have some way within our app to get notify that whether user selected call, don't call and when he/she ended call means notification of end call.
__label__0 Fast resume has pretty much killed my app and I can't delete the WP8.1 XAP from the store, and as such it looks like my app will not be able to go back on the WP Store or if it does it will have to be under a new name and abandon previous customers.
__label__0 I think there is much people who havent got credit card, and can't pay for the games.
__label__0 We have the photochoosertask which works great and does the job, but we do not have access to music on the device.
__label__1 A developer should have the possibility to write his own complete implementation of background audio player or the built-in one should at least provide the possibility of gapless playback or changing audio title/album without pausing playback.
__label__0 Just YouTube using Google Wallet at McD.
__label__0 Timer
__label__0 share a app like in the marketplache but in the menu
__label__0 It has become even more needed with the addition of WXGA and the different scalings in WP8.
__label__0 Hi i am using 720....i upgrade my cell with 8.1 from developers preview.
__label__1 In BYOD concept , block the user from the OS update.
__label__0 When will the alarm feature be implemented in winrt to support the phone?
__label__0 The phone can reach the xml file and it does work in the preview in the App Studio.
__label__1 I want to have sounds enabled to keyboard but not at highest level, also i want to listen to radio (throuth the night) and be sure that the next morning the alarm clock will sound as high as possible to wake me up.
__label__0 It's some idea, please VOTE !!!
__label__0 My wifi is terrible after 8.1 update.
__label__0 I would imagine that thereâè_Ü_d be a way to access the internal elements from code to manipulate them and attach event handlers (hover/touch, etc), change properties (color, opacity, etc).
__label__0 I can use a Silverlight player program (BitGravity Player is what I'm currently using), but it requires me to type an address in.
__label__1 I think we need Completed event and something like SmsResult that can be used.
__label__0 I've been a fan of feedly but am now losing heart.
__label__0 This is not about just having more colors in the them colors dialog, but being able, as a developer.
__label__1 We should be able to use descriptive text overlays in our screenshots, it allows us to better point out what the screenshot is showing.
__label__0 The reason I think this should be allowed is because there are many artists who make their own music that are new and put their music on the device.
__label__0 With Mango this is not possible anymore when having one-time-generated urls.
__label__1 Can Feedly's RSS parser be made to not break this functionality please?"
__label__0 And the same problems apply if i am sending a mass message.
__label__0 Remove the 50 apps limit from the phone and 100 app limit from the marketplace web site when users search for an app with a search term.
__label__0 I hope I can set my App price is $0.2, but I can't now.
__label__0 This should be available both in WinRT and Silverlight applications.
__label__1 When I'm reading a web page or other document, I would find it incredibly useful to be able to jump to the jump of the document without endless swiping.
__label__0 if the homescreen's tile automaticaly arranged in recent , most used, favart, and latest updated.
__label__1 Would be cool to know if app qas opened using voice commands, so if app has its own voice capability it can know to start listening right away.

__label__0 Easy when you dont have lots of contacts, but when you are managing Thousands of contacts, it makes life easy.
__label__0 At present I have to manually record when I change the price, as there appears to be no way to track this in the dev portal, which seems strange given all the other info that is provided in the exported Excel file.
__label__0 The location icon appears at the top but had not been selected or activated.
__label__0 Right now, I can have several Google apps open in separate tabs in Thunderbird.
__label__1 I imagine the default setup could simply default to news and sports from MSN (or one of MS' other affiliates) then allow RSS feeds to be added.

__label__0 Please decouple this workflow and let ISVs submit their apps to the Business Store and NOT to the Retail Store.
__label__0 Of course each app would have permission accepted by user and each app would have own isolated storage for more private.

__label__0 Allowing to prefetch an ad allow the developer to optimise his ad strategy.
__label__1 It would be nice if Runs / Spans inside a Richtextblock / Textblock could support more formatting properties like CSS - i.e. setting background color or a word, putting a border around a word, strikethrough, etc.Currently it's difficult to do some of these things.Nesting UIContainers inside of a RichTextBlock to add border elements needed for this ruins the alignment of text."""
__label__0 I use it every day.
__label__0 Maybe I'm missing something, but this API seems to be broken.

__label__0 Birthday) are always set to low values (like 05/05/0004), but if I try to navigate the contacts through Outlook.com or Contacts/People app I can see the right values.

__label__1 It would be great if there was a way to see all of the content I'd see in google+ via the API, and present it in feedly.
__label__0 Sometime the stretched content of the page does not look professional.
__label__0 Then, I navigate to another page, press the button and it take N screenshots again, one for each language.
__label__1 It would be nice to be able to delete a cert you have uploaded.
__label__0 For instance, i click a hyperlinked phone number and i am given the option to call with the phone, or skype.
__label__0 This System for featuresuggestion is good, but I miss the feedback to the feedback.

__label__1 Should just be able to click the icon and (assuming the account link is active/signed-in) send to Readability.
__label__0 I really have no objection to paying for an app if the developer has done an awesome job, but I take offence to the fact there are developers who mislead customers with the promise of something free and only mention the ads and limited functionality etc once you run it.
__label__0 :) Ironically, this would truly make UWP ""Universal.""
__label__1 Maybe the press to save could change the item color until saved, and the save icon could be disabled until it is saved"
__label__1 zune payer should support custome codec plugin so one can play any format.
__label__0 best regards and a happy new year Karsten Klein from Germany the reminder function in the wp8 calendar must be expand to more weekly options.
__label__1 If this is working as designed, then I thing the NavigationUri in the Reminder is unnecessary and should be marked obsolete, or the documentation should be updated with a limitations on the lock screen.
__label__0 Navigation uri doesn't work if the reminder/alarm ring under lockscreen
__label__0 Is it possible to use Google Auth to save to Pocket from Feedly on Android?"
__label__0 It seems that saving the CookieContainer isn't possible.
__label__0 Unfortunately, it is also bug-infested and lacks fundamental features expected from a graphical debugging tool in 2015.
__label__0 In France it shows 4 ratings with 5 stars and in all other countries it shows 0 ratings!
__label__0 you guys are getting worse.
__label__1 Add UI element a/o shortcut to quickly add reference to default Evernote folder w/t popup dialog or confirmation.
__label__1 If I search something the first app in the list should be the one with the best user rating and most frequent updates, even if the app is not the official one.
__label__0 Can I only not find it or is it really gone?
__label__0 Those apps are as good as useless to consumers (cheap website wrappers etc.) and still have dozens of maximum ratings shortly after being released.
__label__0 This very much limits business type apps that can use resources or run apps while connected to a work network.

__label__1 Improve loading times for your apps by increasing the loading time by waiting 2 seconds less.
__label__1 I would also be nice to be able to retain some kind of unique key the app could store or some other way the app can have a way to query 'to-do' items that the app created.
__label__0 This could be implemented via WiFi, of course (since Zune does wireless Sync already), or even Bluetooth___ more

__label__0 These services would be in charge of running the API and posting the data and could take the form of an implementable interface such as a ILinkSharer or something similar allowing the windows phone sharing interface to constantly expand and become dynamic, tailored to the users needs while removing the requirement for Microsoft to make the updates (As the Zune attempted to do with it's apps, a bad idea).

__label__0 If I categorize my game as a game in the manifest it doesn't appear on the lock screen notifications even though I implement all requirements.
__label__0 too often we come across a word in an app we might not know or we just want to confirm the meaning of it we colud look it up right where u r without the need to exit n go in to another app.

__label__0 In the Pocket settings I only seem to have the ability to set a Pocket username and password.
__label__0 There are few standard patterns for navigation and if Split view has those OOB then developing apps because a breeze.

__label__0 The sort by Most Helpful which is the default setting in the on-line web version of the store appears to ignore the helpfulness ratings (they all show 0), and then seems to show a lot of the lower ratings for my app despite the fact that it statistically has a lot of 4 and 5 star ratings.A better choice would be to sort by to default to Most Recent like it used to.Or use most recent as a tie-break when no usefulness data is available."""
__label__0 There is SSL/TLS socket support in Windows Phone 8.
__label__0 The older tooling (AppDeployCmd.exe) would allow us to list the available emulators we could deploy to and deploy to them (though it's support for devices left a lot to be desired).
__label__1 Could you install something like that under the sharing options?"
__label__0 For example, logging GPS position for a tracking application with vehicle power supplied to the phone would run for 2sec every 30sec with another background task running every 30min for perhaps 30sec to send the batched data to a webservice.

__label__0 .wma files copied/moved to Music library using MediaLibraryExtensions.SaveSong() API from a windows phone app are stored in Music library with .mp3 extension, though the audio file itself will play properly from Music library When you share it via email - you can notice that file attached has a .mp3 extension Or connect phone to PC with usb cable and browse through windows explorer to Music folder - you will find the file with .mp3 extension.
__label__0 Together, this level of support would cater to a market that would like to leverage the Marketplace in a unique way while having the tools and capabilities to develop apps without requirements of personal accounts or devices.
__label__0 Enabling developers to access a the data sent to the device screen for displaying.
__label__0 Having to RE enter things like version number, application name, etc when submitting a new app is just grounds for making mistakes.

__label__1 This should work just like any other kind of image data.
__label__0 If you simply say an app failed with the policy number 2.11 or so, what can a developer benefit out of it, rather he will be more confused and after a couple of times, it will be frustrating.

__label__1 Please consider speaking to the people of Beyond Pod to integrate with their app."
__label__1 UWP really needs a way to handle master-details situations easily, maybe something like UISplitViewController offered in iOS SDK
__label__0 Now let's say you have two other libs, B and C, and both of these depend on A.
__label__0 Also the 'more from' publisher was an easy way for the developer to promote one's other published apps.
__label__0 Although my mouse click is properly sent to the ""close"" button, any mouse movement after the popup goes away, is sent to the side pane -- which causes it to ""intelligently"" expand and reflow the list of articles that I am trying to read.

__label__0 Current WP7 does not allow the keyboard to be replaced.
__label__0 It has a new feature to add a route that will be displayed under street names.
__label__0 It displays the certificate signer information, but you could easily upload two certificates with different CNs (service names) issued by a single CA and you would have no way of telling them apart.
__label__1 I suggest to make it back 30.
__label__0 i have about 30 apps and it is already difficult to find an app ...i think the jumplist shuld be always available.
__label__1 Please allow seeing download numbers for ALL apps in the chart for any given time period.
__label__0 As an example, we have a media player app for iOS, Android, Windows 8.1 that does some sound processing and mixing between mp3 files available in the library and the recording of the mic.
__label__1 I just want to tell you that it will be good if you give option to lock the applications specifically,like sms,..
__label__1 Please create this option native to TextBox control It's very usefull in WinForm projects and could speed up development on universal app too.
__label__0 It is very important that we support beta for both Windows Phone and Windows.
__label__0 My App has no choice 18+, submit audit, report feedback 18+, audit failure
__label__0 I wish to support many platforms as best I can with as much common code as possible.
__label__1 Developers need a way of sharing data between applications.
__label__0 For solid users/sharing, often categories are organized by priority/tier or other purpose, not what makes most sense for social sharing and assigning tags to a specific feed.	
__label__0 When you use the PhotoChooserTask and specify a PixelWidth and PixelHeight, when an image is chosen, the user is provided with a cropping tool that is outstanding and difficult to duplicate.
__label__1 Please fix this by updating the manifest.json file inside the app.
__label__0 this would speed up searches.
__label__1 We need different sound levels...sound level for system, for alarm clock, for music-radio, and different for keyboard.
__label__0 A case in point being the ContentDialog which lays itself out differently depending on what the text scaling value is set to.
__label__0 It would also destroy a lot of value for the C#-based users of the library.)
__label__0 You have to take screenshots in one language, change it to another, wait until emulator reloads and so on.
__label__1 Better marketplace - I would like a new UI 9.
__label__0 However, if you entered shorter lines, you will find that this dragging action does not work until such time as the "I" cursor makes contact with some text.
__label__0 But I'm missing that list animations seen on Settings or Messaging apps when opening or closing them.
__label__0 Consider also option where you have application in several languages.
__label__0 Right now its impossible to create a custom playlist in a media player app without transferring all the songs to ISO.
__label__0 Currently if the user clicks the "save" button right after using the SIP, the data entered is not persisted to the object bound to the control.
__label__0 some articles include slideshows with article information that have to be viewed with a swipe action.
__label__1 Such a login process should not be allowed.
__label__0 Silverlight for WindowsPhone provides basic, built-in binding validation through the Binding.ValidatesOnExceptions property, as documented in the Silverlight Data Binding topic.

__label__0 I have read, that another user have the same problem with WP8-Phone, like HTC.
__label__0 That I suppose is currently not possible.
__label__0 - IProvideValueTarget interface - INameScope interface - ... and more!
__label__0 Contrast this with the Windows Phone world, where the developer indicates trial mode in the store, but has to manually track the number of days since install, whether the user has purchased, etc.
__label__0 or at least distinct records (different taxes, sales Price, date time).
__label__0 I've only noticed this on two feeds, my own blog and XKCD's.
__label__1 This needs fixing as a number 1 priority.
__label__0 If you have a password set on your lockscreen, swipe up to show the password keyboard.
__label__0 In this way, every decent game would get a considerable amount of exposure each day, while apps that had a rough beginning could mend their flaws and become successful apps.
__label__0 Right now, the value is always UnknownError.
__label__0 "To import an OPML file" still shows a link to http://cloud/feedly.com but the link is redirecting.
__label__1 For example, allowing the user to view the time___ more
__label__0 Currently there are no reports to show the purchases or downloads in real-time as and when it happens.
__label__1 in addition, the user should be able to take a scree shot within the multitasking area by using a finger gesture to drag the app towarda the bottom of the screen, a screen capture icon should appear and the outer edges of the icon should fill with green and onve the edges are completly green a photograph noise will occur allow with a sudden screen flare to tell the user the screen shot has been taken and saved in the saved images folder the mutitasking area should have every app that you have opened in it.
__label__0 We upload a new version or have the users download an update immediately.
__label__0 This would make integration with other stuff (eg newsbeuter) possible.
__label__0 every 15 sec ONLY when subscribed to Geolocator's StatusChanged/PositionChanged; works fine otherwise.
__label__1 I suggest do it like it is done in the Google Reader Watcher (http://ajnasz.hu/google-reader-watcher).
__label__0 There are workarounds, of course, like creating a timed background app that wakes up and looks at the camera roll for new stuff every so often, but that is a polling approach, which is always much less desirable and power efficient than an event-driven one.
__label__0 If you push this button, start camera app and starting search QR-code.
__label__0 It doesn't have to be full access.
__label__0 By providing the ability to assign an icon placed on the IsolatedStorage, the developer will be free to create button icons at runtime, dynamically download them from other places etc.
__label__1 Easy access to the Bing Music API would be really useful, especially for apps with artist/song recognition.

__label__0 You can't use ""paste"" in the search bar/field and you can't use Feedly as a sharing option in other Android apps (Dolphin Browser, etc.).
__label__0 Azure support system is a very good example how this should work.
__label__1 Please implement.
__label__0 There might be a flyout with further options to create a Shortcut to the Application, or the Current File, or Create a Tile.
__label__0 Or even on a regular ol' website.
__label__0 I don't understand why if I search with the simple term as ""planner"" it does not show up.
__label__0 (related UV suggestion: http://wpdev.uservoice.com/suggestions/4328935 ) Not all developers care about all emulator images that are displayed in the VS list.
__label__0 My company likes WP7, but the nonexistence of visual voice-mail is stopping a switch from the iPhone.

__label__0 This is required for many built in car hand frees.
__label__1 Please make sure that any data accessible from the Contact Details page is made available to the Contact class.
__label__1 Please take this into consideration and make the ID public (maybe with a new capability requirement).
__label__0 For instance, if I build a children's book app and then submit that same app 50 times, each time with a different name and book loaded, i have essentially used up all the available space on the marketplace app search results screen, thereby stifling competition and innovation through use of questionable practices and a bad app design.
__label__0 We get an answer back and know how devices are in the network.
__label__0 The problem is probably when the app tryies to access BackgroundMediaPlayer.Current in IBackgrounTask.Run method - it fires the background task once again, what shouldn't happen.
__label__0 This problem happens randomly.
__label__0 native Midi file support
__label__1 The donated money will be transferred to all publishers who are interested in getting donations, similar to ""unclaimed flatters"".

__label__1 I would like to have control over the size, positioning and playback of a video.
__label__0 But it isn't, because the AudioVideoCaptureDevice instance has been auto-magically disposed.
__label__1 Integrate Twitter cards on article preview page, so that when viewing an article that has an embedded twitter card with all its information, it shows the card instead of plain text.
__label__1 Please add back support for Remote Desktop Services objects for Windows 10 Universal Apps or provide an alternative for same.Remote Desktop Services objects for Windows Store apps are no longer available for use as of Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 Technical Preview.Please refer, https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh974571.aspx It is necessary for creating screen sharing or remote desktop apps."""
__label__0 And this causes me very serious problems: 1.
__label__0 The reason for this is for users to be able to do things like apply filters, add audio tracks, crop out a relevant section, etc... of a recorded video and saving it back to the MediaLibrary.
__label__0 I love that!
__label__0 Hi All, Apologies if I'm posting this in the wrong place!
__label__0 There are some devs that are making multiple Windows Store accounts to spam the same repackaged apps.
__label__0 Both show we a Google login in a web view within their apps.

__label__0 :-) Hello, thank you for this site.
__label__0 The same way that control panel does.
__label__0 I'm betting on WP7 growing in 2012 - U need to do a MUCH better 'Job' on the TV advertising - I saw the start of the TV advert and said to myself 'Please don't let this be the new WP7 ad ' and sure as heck it was.

__label__0 A store app uses BackgroundDownloader download a FTP URI.After the first successful download, BackgroundDownloader caches the resulting file.Regardless of whether the FTP server is online or the file is updated, downloaded again will be successful to get a cache file."

__label__1 want to still be able to subscribe to Twitter feeds without having to create Twitter account
__label__1 As an app developer working with custom Bluetooth devices, I need to be able to communicate with them in an unpaired scenario.
__label__0 SAP is superior to only HF as it enables e.g.
__label__0 Windows Phone 8 may have 3 new resolutions, but it only actually has two aspect ratios, 150% scaling and 160% scaling (accessible through App.Current.Host.Content.ScaleFactor).
__label__0 On Windows 8.1 / RT 8.1 che call to the PickContactAsync() works but I receive wrong data instaed, for example: FirstName and LastName are both in FirstName (and LastName is___ more

__label__0 I mean we can access system files, registry etc, Like we can do with our PC.

__label__0 Or, is the no of background apps limited and oldest ones are being closed when new ones (including menues left open) come on?
__label__1 As you know, online games and app connectivity are quite popular features these days.I may be overlooking it, but it would beneficial to both devs and Microsoft if Windows Universal apps had access to a universal server for networking apps together."

__label__0 Windows 10 has a great feedback system.

__label__1 Could a Smart dial please be finally applied to the phone app?
__label__0 Currently only Store apps can be submitted to the Store.
__label__0 gimme bar https://gimmebar.com/
__label__0 This option is very important when RSS feed contains only text excerpt.
__label__0 When using classic Win32 MessageBox() API, the spawned dialog allows you to copy its content (using Ctrl+C).The equivalent WinRT API - MessageDialog - provides no apparent means to copy the message to clipboard - no response to right click, no response to Ctrl+C. Sample code: using namespace Windows::UI::Popups; MessageDialog^ dlg = ref new MessageDialog(""""somemessage""""); dlg->Title = """"sometitle"""" dlg->ShowAsync(); Thanks for your attention."""
__label__1 Provide preference setting to categorize apps in the long list by their categories in app store rather than names or alphabetical order...this is extremely helpful for people with lots of apps and provide the ability to maintain the uniformity of the UI while making it more user friendly

__label__0 Get it, I do not want Bing!
__label__0 Provide the access to pictures in PhotoChooser and Camera Roll in emulator
__label__0 While we understand your current situation, we cannot change your region once selected.
__label__1 If I have a feed in a folder named COOKING I would like the IFTTT ingredient entitled ArticleCategories to return COOKING.
__label__1 Please implement a permanent fix to the relevant back-end systems.
__label__1 There are a lot of feedbacks asking to allow developers to delete/remove apps and IAPs from their Dev Center.
__label__0 Well, the 10 apps showing when I search for the title, has NOTHING to do with the word I searched for, and the search word is the exact title of my app, and yet it doesn't show (not atâè_âè__ more"
__label__1 Hi, Please add the From To options right after "Download new email" under each email account to specify when the phone is allowed to check emails.

__label__0 Mostly, Nokia's and Here's apps (some examples: Nokia camera, Here Maps, Here Drive+) were not backed up.
__label__0 While use Digital signature certificate Jawa is not working
__label__0 This function might change the independent news market in a similar way as Amazons Kindle unlimited did to the book market and might attract both readers and authors to sign up for a feedly account.
__label__0 This combined with file drag drop from Windows Explorer would make app life cycle debugging a lot simpler.
__label__1 Just like the user can select apps that are allowed to run in the background, it would be great if they could select apps that are allowed to change phone settings.
__label__1 The date drop down in the Windows Dev Center needs to have custom date so the developers can see the total download of their application of any interval they enter.
__label__0 I have been trying to encourage many of my friends to try making applications.
__label__1 I guess such a feature would be a big advantage for your service."
__label__0 Contrast this with the Windows Phone world, where the developer indicates trial mode in the store, but has to manually track the number of days___ more
__label__0 Thinking this meant that my app name was already being used by someone else, I changed the name slightly.
__label__0 Altough there are app like office, acrobet reader and many 3rd party apps which handles the particular content-type.

__label__0 nan
__label__0 Read/write accsess to email sync settings could enable applications to create custom sync profiles (based on week-days, time, position, etc).
__label__0 - .
__label__1 We would like to know when users remove their company app management from their devices, a kind of Sync ml Checkout message Ability to configure the company app with one click on a link like companyapp://user=foo&pwd=bar&server=contoso.com), then user clicks on it on a mail, sees a warning and accept then it automatically connects to the server The ability to install pkcs12 certificates Add website tiles on the main menu of the phone using MDM Query location using SyncMl commands

__label__0 I am concerned about security and DRM issues.
__label__1 I'd like to know what rank my app is in each country and category in the app store.

__label__0 Yes my internet upload speed is slow, but the site should function for slow upload speeds also, why not.
__label__0 Like change his color (like a native UWP) and toggle full screen mode.
__label__0 What kind of joking?
__label__0 For instance instagram, vimeo videos.
__label__0 This would allow (as others have suggested) a more streamlined process for tracking changes and perhaps even uploading a single package without having to fill in the blanks.
__label__1 I believe the single most important thing for Windows Phone to be successful is that users in all countries should have the same services available.
__label__1 For example, allowing the user to view the time it would take to reach full charge on USB vs induction.
__label__1 File Transfer should pause when a call is made or comes in.
__label__0 I know it could be more plaisant, more colorfull, graphically improved, still better tuned to my real needs.
__label__0 I'll have ro out the other caller on hold to get a number.
__label__0 One possible use case: A smart watch that uses the phone as a way to access information in the internet.
__label__1 You could also consider implementing this partially: for example, allow inheritance only between managed WinRT classes, and deriving managed classes from native WinRT classes."
__label__0 Can this be possible on the phone.
__label__0 FAS reduces the changes of applications Tombstoning but it still needs to be handled.
__label__0 We need to open our Application, or to overwrite the notify to costumize it to get a better improvement for the user.
__label__0 Local database support would be much more useful with the addition of full-text search support for quickly querying large amounts of text (e.g.
__label__0 to add more colors to that list from your app.
__label__0 My app (Freda) is an ebook reader which has been popular and much-downloaded ever since 2010 - and it's appeared always in the top 5 results for a store search for 'ebook reader'.
__label__0 This now requires creating a custom control.
__label__0 One has to write its own libraries simply to encode and decode videos and access the frames, let alone manipulate them and do something useful.
__label__1 I want to open feeds outside of Feedly sometimes and look at the site it came from.
__label__1 Would be nice if that was possible.
__label__0 When you could connect your feedly to your wordpress.com account, why shouldn't you be able to subscribe to them?
__label__0 I have to redirect the user to a web site which will then open the YouTube app which will then play the video.
__label__0 In Windows Phone 8 we were able directly access facebook through the people hub.

__label__1 It would be great if you could add a link / bookmark right into your Diigo account while reading in Feedly.
__label__0 Same for maps, youtube links, website links (that also have an app), etc...
__label__0 - Boolean AdaptItemHeight - Integer MaxNumberOfColumns With AdaptItemHeight set to true the height of the gridviewitems can be variable.
__label__1 Also need API for voice record with background agent.
__label__0 Tombstoning and FAS paradigms are non-trivial to many new WP7 developers and error prone due to many developers not understanding it completely.
__label__0 Of course, we have iOS and Android versions that work on phones.
__label__1 Since you can integrate with Twitter, it would be nice to have my "saved" links across both platforms show up in a nice readable format in Feedly.
__label__0 Please fix this.
__label__1 Also, if it's possible to override save for later to pocket."
__label__0 It is good that you started this unification with the common core!
__label__0 Also, similar bug was spotted in native twitter client: then uploading a picture to pic.twitter.com, original tweet is displayed as "??????..."
__label__0 Windows Phone 8.1 introduces the Social Extensibility Framework.

__label__0 The much promised bridge for the store called Centennial for class apps is still not in sight.
__label__0 Hi, I am developing an app that play remote MP4 file via Internet using MediaElement.

__label__0 I could only___ more

__label__1 Give us an implementation of RadialGradientBrush that automatically uses acceleration when available.
__label__0 Now it work, but...the the Header___ more

__label__0 This can be done through a support ticket.
__label__1 My idea to add a feature of ... "apps to be given permission by the user to run in background whenever required" prompting the user that "enabling an app to run in background may cause battery drainage"...
__label__0 Also the store is much less friendly for developer than the other 2.
__label__0 Lastly, you can enter a full stop and a space by hitting space twice, like this.
__label__0 On iOS, it's possible to target many versions of the OS (6.0, 6.1, 7.0, 7.1, 8.0, etc.)
__label__0 It takes years to learn how to handle windows 7.
__label__0 For eg in publisher name or in application name, whole word, partial word and so on.
__label__0 Support Windows Server 2008 R2
__label__1 Provide API to easy save settings of an app online (and restore after unnstall or reset/change phone), using a Microsoft account (http://wpdev.uservoice.com/forums/110705-dev-platform/suggestions/3781612-microsoft-account-login) and online service (skydrive/azure ?)
__label__1 Please develop a new type based on string(i.e.
__label__0 If I'm already connected, the bot could write headlines (with links) to me upon receipt of the news in my rss-subscription."
__label__0 Some of my users will still receive the old version of my app (after weeks).
__label__0 That's a huge problem regarding developer investing on the platform."
__label__0 This submission went through smoothly.
__label__0 There is no option to disconnect in any way.
__label__1 Maximizing all current main apps would be better than having 1mil appd in the marketplace.
__label__0 My client is a well known home appliances manufacturing company , and they insist on regular update from app even when app is not running , which we successfully implemented in Android and iOS.
__label__0 This just makes me angry as a serious developer!
__label__0 Thus one has to manually dig through MSDN to find the correct signature.
__label__0 Ideally, users would only need 2 icons for the marketplace: 'Tile' (contains the application name), and 'List' (just the icon for the app list).
__label__0 Being able to use simple uncompressed .wav files would open up many possibilities for ring tone editors, and make files recorded from the microphone ready to be used as ringtones.
__label__0 This was fantastic for those sites which offer more content in their email newsletter than their RSS feed (or lack an RSS feed completely).
__label__1 If you wont let me change the country, at least let me close my account and recreate it!
__label__1 The Store lists purchase history, but a) re-installation must be done one by one and b) the list doesn't indicate which apps have been removed e.g.
__label__0 I've updated my ipad and now can't use feedly with buffer at all.
__label__0 register as a launcher/chooser] to ease on-device inter-application communication

__label__1 A user should be able to deside between power drain and functions.
__label__1 Tuenti is a social network as Facebook (in Spanish or English or Catalan), it would be very useful for spanish people or south americans or people who have signed up on it, to have it (integrated) into the people hub.
__label__0 Also would like to mention that I have Matching word in my application name.
__label__0 It would make chaining additional operations much more easier!
__label__0 what o.O

__label__1 Apparently Windows 8.1 HTML store apps do not support IndexedDB, so developers are using ad-hoc solutions on top of SQLite:http://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2014/07/02/writing-a-sqlite-wrapper-component-for-universal-windows-apps/ This is a poor state of affairs for the web platform, since IndexedDB has long replaced WebSQL as the preferred way to store user data.So it should be supported in store apps."""

__label__0 At this moment the Launcher when launchs an URI it only supports http uris, it will be interesting that supports file:/// uris to send the launcher to open PDFs, words, and any file with just the URI, we do not need the StorageFile.And in a BackgroundTask, the Launcher just does not launch websites, it is interesting to launch websites and reports in the computer in the morning saving time."""
__label__1 I love how you have pintrest integration on your images - please consider adding GimmeBar integration as well.
__label__0 SMIL is the ""lingua franca"" of vector animation.

__label__1 I need a posibility to set the keyboard language from code.
__label__0 A mechanism that operates like PhoneGap/Cordova would have to be implemented so that access to external hardware APIs can be achieved.
__label__0 Keep up the good work wp team and Microsoft!
__label__0 However, the phone versions of the controls do not provide validation templates.
__label__0 The Store search heavily favours matching the search term to the app name over matching to the keywords.

__label__1 And please don't always use security risk as excuse for not allowing people to create more creative apps than Edge.

__label__0 Regional Format does not automaticly mean the region i set the device to or the UI Langauge i chose.
__label__0 Also service is too slow.
__label__0 Is there any fix for this problem?
__label__0 But look what happens when i try (note the lower case i) to use the auto-complete, which is set to add a space after being used: it won't subsequently recognise the double space, like so this should be new sentence, but instead i have three spaces.

__label__1 I would like the Feedly Chrome app to act just like the Google Reader one, shows how many feeds I have and I can click on them individually.
__label__0 When developing with the phone connected via USB, having the screen lock itself is very annoying, and makes app deployment fail.
__label__0 Something like http://livetiles.co.uk/Beta/Default.html but from MS, perhaps a part of http://www.windowsphone.com/marketplace ?
__label__0 I know of many folks -- including yours truly -- who use Feedly in conjunction with Pocket.
__label__0 It's only currently possible via the web browser.
__label__0 When looking at help & examples online while working on my code, I sometimes run into differences between WPF, Windows Runtime, and Silverlight but don't realize it right away, and end up frustrating myself until I do.I see no reason to have 3 variations that are so similar, especially with the current efforts to make things universal."

__label__0 Of course they can come back, but they'll have to re-pay the registration fee again, and when being banned again every week, it won't pay out for them anymore.
__label__0 iOS already has this API's!
__label__1 There need to be a business app settings launcher native in the API.
__label__0 At the moment that is limited to 12 months.
__label__0 It is especially wierd since they can sync pictures and music.
__label__0 I don't know how to change this... to make this works properly.
__label__0 However the collection does not implement Sort, and it does even implement Move (so you can implement sorting on your own by extending it).
__label__0 iOS has this implemented in their store and I believe it works great.
__label__0 I find it easier to keep up with my subscriptions in Feedly than in YouTube!
__label__1 If the app shows sensitive data when deativated, it would be good to be able to use a different image for fast app switching instead of a screenshot of the application
__label__0 Hyper-V is a powerful VM management tool, and it includes the ability to create new images and manage snapshots within them, allowing developers to save the current state of the VM (e.g., to manage particular testing scenarios such as upgrading the app when a good amount of custom data is in it, either for one app or multiple) or to roll the state back to a prior checkpoint marked in the VM.

__label__0 Other folder continues to grow till phone storage is full.
__label__1 Can you please provide a report viewer control to view SSRS reports in windows phone.

__label__0 I just chatted to support, they told me that it was because the name was too generic.
__label__1 On the keyboard near the space button, add new button "input from camera".
__label__0 Ability to tag friends on Facebook posts & in the Check In section of the people hub
__label__0 Then i want to use my phone as usual, go in to other apps and that kind of stuff.
__label__0 The process (particularly for someone under the age of 18) of getting a Dreamspark account (particularly now that you've messed up that website) and an App Hub account is absolutely awful.
__label__0 You can sometimes work around this behaviour by specifying a search for the place you're trying to indicate but this is dependent upon the search results.
__label__0 the phone jumps to other pages when I am scrolling up and down.
__label__1 Please modify like this. "
__label__0 Media player buttons are possible in the taskbar but why not the progressbar?
__label__0 App is in store with current policies at that time, there is no point applying new policies and make developer to work on old stuff.

__label__0 The WebBrowser control performs very poorly to scrolling and html content inside 3rd party apps whereas the same page when opened inside the browser works fine.
__label__0 For example, get a list of all email accounts and for each account report the number of unread emails.
__label__0 Both on my iOS and Droid I can use my work email exchange server.
__label__0 3 - Likewise, top and bottom app bars in Windows 8 could be translated into the Windows Phone versions automatically, if for example buttons were found in those controls.
__label__0 let there be more than 9.
__label__0 Back in the Windows Mobile/CE days, Microsoft had a Device Emulator that would faithfully emulate an ARM CPU and would execute exactly that same code that eventually went to the device.
__label__0 This came up while talking to other developers at a few talks/meetups (not because I created the largest vector based creative commons icon pack for Windows Phone that many of you use already).
__label__1 I drag the url to my feedly bookmark, and Feedly adds the feed to my account (even better would be the ability to categorize the feed as I add it).
__label__0 :) Sir/Ma'am some uses have buy Windows Phone 7 only then because they was thinking that in Windows Phone 7 they can access system files and can be able to modify their Windows Phone 7 according to their need and as they want, But you break our heart :( You can think that if Windows Phone 7 will be fully unlock then some users can illegally copy applications from one Windows Phone 7 to another Windows Phone 7.
__label__0 This is an issue when the application returns to the foreground and ActivatedEventArgsIsApplicationInstancePreserved == true, because all application memory should be intact.
__label__1 Add ability to share whole articles to Evernote.
__label__0 Right now it only tells me whether the battery source is External or Battery, but 'external' is too generic.
__label__0 emailcomposetask must have html support.
__label__0 However, the downside of that would be that you couldn't place this widget in a homescreen folder."
__label__1 The new Feedly ios9 (iPad App) integration with Safari is fantastic but please allow a simple left to right swipe to take you from an article you have finished reading in Safari, back into Feedly (instead of having to use 'Done' at the top of the Safari Browser.

__label__0 So although in, e.g., .NET-based store apps, the System.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource class is available and can be used to generate custom ETW events, there doesn't appear to be any point to this at the moment because you can't actually record those events in a trace!
__label__0 Like ability to zoom in.
__label__0 To use the app you only need to enter you phone number without registration or logging in.
__label__0 I'm constantly missing important content that happens in google+ as I don't check it regularly.
__label__0 Your account is validating by Symantec.You cannot submit any app during this period.It will takes 7 to 10 days typically.Open your account settings and make sure registered information is correct.When you modify account information, vetting will be triggered automatically."
__label__0 I notice it is already available to the user in the 7.1 version (Mango) but I don't see methods in the API for scanning to the next signal (or seeking, whatever the term is called).
__label__0 Would give Windows Phone more exposure, especially when Xbox users can see all the Xbox Live games for Windows Phone availiable.
__label__1 I would like the option to schedule my mail synchronization.
__label__0 I am unable to understand the reason!!
__label__0 Since the easiest way to get hold of files to be used in programs is by downloading them from a network or the internet and saving them in isolated storage it would make the whole thing a lot easier if you could do this with FTP.
__label__1 they all use Sip so it would be great to have a native sip client integrated.

__label__1 Add an option to delete future appointment in Calendar and preserve previous, when used the option to repeat
__label__0 Cheers!
__label__0 But in windows every time we hav to open contact and search name.. Ex.
__label__0 Because this is SSO for phone, the token is filled in and the app continues like the user had entered their credentials correctly.
__label__1 give me ONE place to consume everything, but only see it once (unless I save it). 
__label__0 However, since the original account is tied to my Microsoft Id (which is used everywhere else!)
__label__0 So each morning I start my day with my Inbox, Google Calendar, and Google Reader each in their own tab, right there together in one app.
__label__0 For example I am currently not able to edit any of my IAP descriptions translated to 14 languages because they exceed the 200 characters limit.
__label__0 So something like: PeerFinder.AlternateIdentities["Bluetooth:UnPaired"] = "";
__label__0 Please give me info.
__label__1 I really need this and i can't call every day custommer care support to see my balance, to buy net and etc.
__label__1 A thing that would be increbible is that your phone make a sound when you whistle or Clap hands a certain pattern ( wich could be preseted by the phone owner ) so when you can't find your phone and you dont have a buddy around to text you, you can find it!

__label__0 In my view, and I can see from the forums and user voice channel that I am not alone in this, the Store search provides a poor customer experience by not catering effectively for use case two.
__label__0 Also lack of support to display symbols and equations is annoying, as some word docs i need include them.
__label__0 There is a very annoying bug in the Windows 10 Store that hides apps form listing.

__label__0 You can retweet and answer Tweets but You cant favorite
__label__0 This is very strange, since I was expecting to see at least Contacts app to be launched, seems there's some problem establishing the contract.
__label__0 Every app places the search control in different areas, often hidden under a sub-section of the app.
__label__1 Change search engine of internet explorer, etc.
__label__0 A lot of people are moving to F# PCLs for library code and to be able to use those PCLs in the UWP and get native compilation via .
__label__0 Why only have static country of registration there.
__label__0 WP has all of the security from 8.1 and features and some nice features please let the last feature be the Android apps.
__label__0 Right now, the only way I can find to make a stand-alone Feedly app with Fluid is to use these instructions, http://rudis.net/content/2009/11/22/feedly-safari-fluidapp-painless-updates.
__label__1 Also, it would be really useful to have an apostrophe available on the main text entry screen.
__label__0 Using Roslyn (as DuoCode does), UWP Applications written in Xaml and C#/VB.NET get transpiled into JavaScript and rendered via HTML5 canvas.
__label__0 With the PhoneToolkit I can Instantiate polygons or other UI with an template that I can give to my more artistic gifted friends for making my map symbols stylish.
__label__0 This limitation basically stops our project for WP8.
__label__0 NET for Windows 10, JavaScript ""for everything else.""
__label__0 ohhh that would be awesome.
__label__1 Hey, Please Please make the classes in above framework like SongCollection, Playlists etc immutable and unabstract.
__label__0 We can see this feature already in some operational systems...
__label__0 In more detailed/extremely simplified: What about having an app that rotates an image, an app that uploads images into the web and an app that is capable to send an image to the nearest printer.
__label__0 Possible solution: Route class implements IRoutePath.
__label__0 Wich means the new version not fully replaced the old version and this causes me very serious problems: 1.
__label__0 For example, suppose you wanted to color a US map by probability of each electoral district voting a certain way.
__label__0 Currently you can assign to ApplicationBarIconButton an icon present on your project as 'content'.
__label__1 Please bring back the simplicity and efficiency of Windows Phone!
__label__1 It seems to me that all good apps/games should have a chance at decent exposure in the top charts, and waiting to be featured just isn't worth it.
__label__0 But he also said that NOT all of the data would be possible to transfer, like "reporting".
__label__0 Compare skype, viber and tango apps on windows phone with Android and iphone.
__label__0 this gives them impression that my APP is slow.
__label__1 I want that feature back as I would like to mail my articles directly.

__label__0 But if I press power button and unlock device and open phone and say "call <person name, device start calling correctly!
__label__0 I've encountered an issue in Background Audio behavior dependent on app's name.

__label__1 It would be nice to sync any feeds from that store to Feedly.
__label__0 nan
__label__1 It might be an idea to add a flatter function to feedly.
__label__0 If you think that which users have buy your Windows Phone 7 with contract they can misuse it then Please left them and unlock that phone who has buy Windows Phone 7 without any contract and have factory unlock(Here factory unlock means that phone which can accept any SIM) If you think that if you unlock Windows Phone 7 then which users don't have sufficient knowledge and by mistake they can corrupt/delete system files,___ more
__label__0 I had to turn off the Windows tray app.
__label__1 As a developer we should be able to create subusers who has no access to sales data, kind of release manager role we can assign to them.Currently there is no such provision and all of employees who are coding and publishing apps, easily know the revenue earned."
__label__0 This enables a number of cross app communication scenarios and lets the user choose how he wants to share that info
__label__0 This allows a team to use these devices for testing, as opposed to having to put company apps on their personal devices or hand their devices over for demonstrations.
__label__0 Currently (Windows Phone 8.1) if you store your credentials in the PasswordVault, they aren't deleted on app uninstall, so if you install the app again the last stored credentials are available.
__label__0 WP8 SDK provides file type association http://utorrentideas.uservoice.com/forums/47263-%C2%B5torrent-for-windows/suggestions/3417415-torrent-file-association-in-windows-phone, please provide the same feature in WP7.8
__label__0 As the heading says provide tools to prevent users from reinstalling apps rather than buy the full version and stop devs from being deprived of purchases that they deserve.
__label__1 MS' could even add features like they have in Media Center for Sports such as a ticker feed and Fantasy player tracking.
__label__0 Markup Extensions are found in the following Xaml Systems: - WPF - Silverlight 5 - Xamarin.Forms (notably NOT a Microsoft technology, but recognizes their power nonetheless) This feature is to ask for Xaml serialization featureset parity with WPF/System.
__label__0 There is no way for a WP7 application using UdpAnySourceMulticastClient or Socket to listen on the correct port, thus requiring a great deal of time to be spent in any UPnP application when doing device discovery.

__label__0 This can help us implement positioning in a small aera, which just like what Apple iBeacon does.
__label__0 We have the app on all of the other stores using the same description and keywords and our app shows up with most words that have anything to do with financial planning, such as finance, financial, retirement, etc.
__label__0 keyword filtering, deleting articles/authors not of interest, prevent unwanted articles from being grabbed by IFTTT.
__label__1 Offering other ways to log in or even Feedly's own registration system might also help.
__label__0 This is a problem when credit cards constantly fail authorization.
__label__0 ( I know that thinking up such a system isn't easy, as you would have to think carefully about abuses)
__label__0 Many times I've read reviews for apps and decided to not get it because I was unsure whether it was listened to and fixed or not.
__label__1 The point is, having some sort of universal capacity to network apps together safely through a universal Microsoft service to greater or lesser extents which would then be proportionally reflected in pricing relative to the amount of usage the apps need would open up developer capacity and increase variety on the store.
__label__1 Create more free GOOD games, and everyone have fun.
__label__0 i came from Android world, where i really liked the google map integration with "turn by turn navigation".
__label__0 We all have to use BackgroundMediaPlayer if we want the audio to continue even when the app is minimized.

__label__1 Allow Windows Phones to compete for end users and enterprise clients on par with Apple/Android (Currently these phones have applications that include location based ringer volume) 3.
__label__0 Since many devs these days use consider only WebKit while developing mobile websites these websites do not render good using IE(which uses Trident isn't much HTML5 compliant).
__label__0 There is however a nice extension to save it to jpg, but that doesn't help if you want to use transparency to leverage the theme accent color in your tile.
__label__0 Thank you.
__label__0 Back and forward buttons needed, not the capacitive back button.
__label__1 If it's MS Windows Phone then make it as a part of the network.
__label__0 Emulators are even slower than the WP7.1 ones, so the process is really long.
__label__0 Like windows mobile 6.5 and older version.There is no option for cold and hard boot in windows phone 7 emulator.
__label__1 Allow an app to disable text messaging preview.
__label__0 Particularly as the number of optional device images that developers can download and install increase, this becomes a more critical need to keep the Windows Phone development workspace clean.
__label__0 Ideally these classes would be extended to accept a UserControl object that would be shown instead of the standard Title.
__label__0 The default setting is way too late--I'd prefer 50% or more remaining before turning on.
__label__0 Increases User Experience.
__label__0 As an app seller, I have to deal with dissatisfied customers ever once in a while.
__label__0 Imagine having an installed app do what it does best for another app, such as perform a series of complex calculations or gather weather data.
__label__1 so we need aupport for such feature in XAML Code like in SilverLight 5
__label__0 Also the scroll viewer should have options to disable overscrolling effect.

__label__0 From these, I concluded that a big part of 3D rendering might be a burden upon CPU, while GPU does not do much.
__label__0 Then the SMS service sends a response.
__label__0 Most even incorporate jump lists into the pinned site icon.
__label__1 The Music+Videos app should have side selection boxes in every category like the ones used for selecting multiple messages in the e-mail app, making it easier to create playlists, and play selected songs/artists/albums/genres/videos.
__label__0 And all of them have the same problem when trying to log into Feedly.
__label__0 Press "delete".
__label__0 Currently there is no way to schedule recurring notifications using ScheduledToastNotification.

__label__0 UWP classes seem not to support WithEvents.
__label__1 Please, please add an option to easily add content by using a mobile device!

__label__0 Cloud version but no option or explanation at any time that all my feeds have gone.
__label__0 In some places it is a problem that children are playing with their phones while in a class.

__label__0 For example, I search for "Star Wars" The IMDb app is suggested.

__label__1 Just please don't keep adding loads of unnecessary features on top.
__label__0 From the search button as it is right now, user scans a bar code, sees the output of the search where he can tap on the icon of the decoded barcode and could be given the choice of an application who can use such information.
__label__0 Now I have to GetScheduledToastNotifications() and delete every single one of them separately (and it doesn't performs well).

__label__0 You can find it here: https://github.com/ericwilligers/svg-animation But the web animation standard is NOT a declarative language for animations, you still need SMIL to describe animations in browsers.
__label__0 This looks really weird and is quite distracting when trying to read my RSS.
__label__0 In the Schedule Namespace ist isn't possible to have access to the Media Library to play Songs, User has already on his Device -> Please add this function to get access to the Media Library.

__label__0 Does this have anything to do with wifi being one of location sources?
__label__0 FileSavePicker Let the program select the Dlg-Open-Directory between 1) the last saved-directory (the actual implemented action) 2) the directory defined by SuggestedStartLocation 3) the directory defined by last action with FileOpenPicker Usecase for 2: The App knows that it is a totaly new/clear situation and the best option for the Save-Dlg is the 'SuggestedStartLocation' Usecase for 3: User opens file, the Dlg for SaveAs should start in the 'FileOpenPicker-directory'
__label__0 Like in the Nokia ad graphics.
__label__0 As it is, it is hardly usable as a beta test program since our customers also need to see the app and improvements in a timely manner.
__label__1 It would be great if I could integrate my Twitter account into Feedly the same way, and have full images or articles displayed alongside my RSS images and articles."
__label__0 The fact that we have to go through C++ to exploit such key resources as DX, D2D, DrawingSurfaces in W8, WPF, WP8 is _NOT_ acceptable.
__label__0 Programmatically enable or disable the feature in various areas of the app.
__label__1 I personally believe Windows is an excellent platform, just go the extra mile, polish the workflow and make it easier for us developers (non experts) to start a project.
__label__1 Is there anything you can do to make Feedly work on IE 7?
__label__0 I thought the ability to create albums in 'photos' would really help users be more organized in storing their photos.

__label__1 It would be greater if we could disable the close function while doing important tasks like writing to the storage, or similar.
__label__0 Would it not be possible to generate a simple invoice and email it to me?
__label__0 This is in fact documented and the offical recommendation is to try/catch closer to the code (https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.application.unhandledexception).
__label__0 Currently, I can detect and control what the embedded Zune player is currently playing.
__label__0 to visit the sites externally for EVERY page is not very convient.
__label__0 Now that we have a wonderfully awesome Evernote integration, it's time to make it easier to use.
__label__0 Now the change has me reaching top right for the ""done"" button .
__label__0 Now you have to open the file and use save page as.
__label__0 Besides making it easier for Android/iOS devs to port to Windows through the bridges, I think you can think of making it easier for devs starting with Windows to easily port the apps to Android/iOS as well.For example you can buy Xamarin and make it free, or develop a bridge to help share C# code with Android/iOS."
__label__0 Inexplicably, the UWP does not include the WPF WrapPanel that was introduced nearly 10 years ago.
__label__0 Right now it's a black box."
__label__0 A media picker control that you could activate that would let the user go through their media library and check off a list of songs or videos.
__label__0 And now the app takes long time to load.
__label__0 If you entered___ more
__label__0 A general use case is that I'm working on an app and just started debugging the application on the device and suppose encountered an issue and now I stopped debugging and now I started to resolve that issue and mostly it takes the time in which the device get locked and again if I debug the app then the same error popups.
__label__1 So I think you should add some ""hide"" some option to not only unpublish app but eventually ""logically remove"" their entries from the dashboard (main app list, graphs, etc.) You can eventually add a page where all the apps/IAPs hidden are listed and there the developer can eventually bring back them to the dashboard in case he changes his mind.
__label__0 I understand that offline support is being worked on and can't wait to use that functionality, however since Google Reader is shutting down within weeks, and BYLINE reader is the ONLY offline reader currently available for commuters, it would be fantastic if you could work together... 
__label__0 How can I remove this limit so I could develop / end applications?
__label__0 The biggest problem I almost exclusively run into when working on WP7 apps is the layout performance of Silverlight.
__label__0 You can only select text as big as screen.
__label__0 User opens my application, click a button, Visual Search gets opened, users scan a barcode, clicks on the thumbnail result and is redirected to my application with information on the code.
__label__1 ShareLinkTask and ShareStatusTask should report error or information if the user doesn't have a social network.

__label__0 However when the Barcode is generated, it will generate this code as image: M1STURM/ANDREAS EZ5E2PU TXLSTRAB 6531 062Y020A0023 33C.
__label__0 Even after I log out of feedly.
__label__0 they dont want to see my reply, nor do i want them to.
__label__0 Recently the 'visit website' launches the internal browser but it fails to load anything.
__label__0 So if I get a Cortana alert or new email and I'm playing CoD I can see it.
__label__0 Try to send the same attachement with 2 different email one with a line in the body and another with a lot of lines and see the difference in the attachement size.
__label__0 But in windows Phone for silverlight dosnt provide the dll System.Windows.Browser.So if we have the support we can call function from javascript in windows phone 7.

__label__1 Many people want you to get rid of the need for an extension and make Feedly a pure-web-based app.

__label__1 It would be ideal to allow apps to expose certain bits of data or functionality to other apps to provide a complementary experience in terms of reuse of information or performing similar tasks.
__label__0 When using Internet Explorer in Windows Phone 8 on Nokia Lumia 1350 (OS 8.0.10517.150) I noticed that pointing to specific section of any document (using #name) doesn't work from pages using frameset (doctype is correctly set to HTML 4.01 supporting framesets).
__label__0 I see no reason to have 3 variations that are so similar, especially with the current efforts to make things universal.
__label__1 The UserControl should run in the context of the application that created the Alarm or Reminder, and as such would have access to the appropriate view models.
__label__0 Enable picture password as in Windows 8.
__label__0 There are also companies living of developing SAPI voices, and it‚_s far between great SAPI voices for non-English languages.
__label__0 It isn't useful for several intersting application.
